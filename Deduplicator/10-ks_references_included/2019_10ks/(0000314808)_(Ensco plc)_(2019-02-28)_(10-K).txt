REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

We provide drilling services on a day rate contract basis. Under day rate contracts, we provide an integrated service that includes the provision of a drilling rig and rig crews for which we receive a daily rate that may vary between the full rate and zero rate throughout the duration of the contractual term, depending on the operations of the rig. We also may receive lump-sum fees or similar compensation for the mobilization, demobilization and capital upgrades of our rigs. Our customers bear substantially all of the costs of constructing the well and supporting drilling operations, as well as the economic risk relative to the success of the well.

Our integrated drilling service provided under each drilling contract is a single performance obligation satisfied over time and comprised of a series of distinct time increments, or service periods. Total revenue is determined for each individual drilling contract by estimating both fixed and variable consideration expected to be earned over the contract term. Fixed consideration generally relates to activities such as mobilization, demobilization and capital upgrades of our rigs that are not distinct within the context of our contracts and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Variable consideration generally relates to distinct service periods during the contract term and is recognized in the period when the services are performed.

The amount estimated for variable consideration is only recognized as revenue to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur during the contract term. We have applied the optional exemption afforded in Update 2014-09 and have not disclosed the variable consideration related to our estimated future day rate revenues. The remaining duration of our drilling contracts based on those in place as of December 31, 2018 was between approximately one month and four years.

Day Rate Drilling Revenue

Our drilling contracts provide for payment on a day rate basis and include a rate schedule with higher rates for periods when the drilling unit is operating and lower rates or zero rates for periods when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted. The day rate invoiced to the customer is determined based on the varying rates applicable to specific activities performed on an hourly basis. Day rate consideration is allocated to the distinct hourly increment to which it relates within the contract term and is generally recognized consistent with the contractual rate invoiced for the services provided during the respective period. Invoices are typically issued to our customers on a monthly basis and payment terms on customer invoices typically range from 30 to 45 days.

Certain of our contracts contain performance incentives whereby we may earn a bonus based on pre-established performance criteria. Such incentives are generally based on our performance over individual monthly time periods or individual wells. Consideration related to performance bonus is generally recognized in the specific time period to which the performance criteria was attributed.

We may receive termination fees if certain drilling contracts are terminated by the customer prior to the end of the contractual term. Such compensation is recognized as revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied, the termination fee can be reasonably measured and collection is probable. For the year ended December 31, 2017, operating revenues included $185.0 million for the lump-sum consideration received in settlement and release of the ENSCO DS-9 customer's ongoing early termination obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, operating revenues included $20.0 million for the lump-sum consideration received in settlement of the ENSCO 8503 customer's remaining obligations under the contract.

Mobilization / Demobilization Revenue

In connection with certain contracts, we receive lump-sum fees or similar compensation for the mobilization of equipment and personnel prior to the commencement of drilling services or the demobilization of equipment and personnel upon contract completion. Fees received for the mobilization or demobilization of equipment and personnel are included in operating revenues. The costs incurred in connection with the mobilization and demobilization of equipment and personnel are included in contract drilling expense.

Mobilization fees received prior to commencement of drilling operations are recorded as a contract liability and amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Demobilization fees expected to be received upon contract completion are estimated at contract inception and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. In some cases, demobilization fees may be contingent upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event. In such cases, this may result in cumulative-effect adjustments to demobilization revenues upon changes in our estimates of future events during the contract term.

Capital Upgrade / Contract Preparation Revenue

In connection with certain contracts, we receive lump-sum fees or similar compensation for requested capital upgrades to our drilling rigs or for other contract preparation work. Fees received for requested capital upgrades and other contract preparation work are recorded as a contract liability and amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term to operating revenues. Costs incurred for capital upgrades are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the asset.

Contract Assets and Liabilities

Contract assets represent amounts recognized as revenue but for which the right to invoice the customer is dependent upon our future performance. Once the previously recognized revenue is invoiced, the corresponding contract asset, or a portion thereof, is transferred to accounts receivable. Contract liabilities generally represent fees received for mobilization or capital upgrades.

Contract assets and liabilities are presented net on our consolidated balance sheet on a contract-by-contract basis. Current contract assets and liabilities are included in other current assets and accrued liabilities and other, respectively, and noncurrent contract assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.

Deferred Contract Costs

Costs incurred for upfront rig mobilizations and certain contract preparations are attributable to our future performance obligation under each respective drilling contract. Such costs are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. Demobilization costs are recognized as incurred upon contract completion. Costs associated with the mobilization of equipment and personnel to more promising market areas without contracts are expensed as incurred. Deferred contract costs were included in other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $23.5 million and $40.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization of such costs totaled $34.0 million, $28.1 million and $42.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Deferred Certification Costs

We must obtain certifications from various regulatory bodies in order to operate our drilling rigs and must maintain such certifications through periodic inspections and surveys. The costs incurred in connection with maintaining such certifications, including inspections, tests, surveys and drydock, as well as remedial structural work and other compliance costs, are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the corresponding certification periods. Deferred regulatory certification and compliance costs were included in other current assets and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $13.6 million and $15.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

In October 2017, as a result of the Atwood Merger, we issued 132.2 million of our Class A Ordinary shares, representing total equity consideration of $770.7 million based on a closing price of $5.83 per Class A ordinary share on October 5, 2017, the last trading day before the Merger Date.

In April, 2016, we closed an underwritten public offering of 65,550,000 Class A ordinary shares at $9.25 per share. We received net proceeds from the offering of $585.5 million.

In October 2016, we entered into a privately-negotiated exchange agreement whereby we issued 1,822,432 Class A ordinary shares, representing less than one percent of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares, in exchange for $24.5 million principal amount of our 2044 Notes, resulting in a pre-tax gain from debt extinguishment of $8.8 million.

As a U.K. company governed in part by the Companies Act, we cannot issue new shares (other than in limited circumstances) without being authorized by our shareholders. At our 2018 annual general meeting, our shareholders authorized the allotment of 145.6 million Class A ordinary shares (or 291.2 million Class A ordinary shares in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue or other similar issue). This authority was further increased by shareholders at an additional general meeting on February 21, 2019, expiring at the next annual shareholder meeting or at the close of business on April 22, 2020 (whichever is earlier).

Under English law, we are only able to declare dividends and return funds to our shareholders out of the accumulated distributable reserves on our statutory balance sheet. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our profitability, liquidity, financial condition, market outlook, reinvestment opportunities, capital requirements and other factors and restrictions our Board of Directors deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.
 Our shareholders approved a new share repurchase program at our annual shareholder meeting held in May 2018. Subject to certain provisions under English law, including the requirement of Ensco plc to have sufficient distributable reserves, we may repurchase shares up to a maximum of $500.0 million in the aggregate from one or more financial intermediaries under the program, but in no case more than 65.0 million shares. The program terminates in May 2023. Our prior share repurchase program approved by our shareholders in 2013, under which we could repurchase up to a maximum of $2.0 billion in the aggregate, not to exceed 35.0 million shares, expired in May 2018. As of December 31, 2018, there had been no share repurchases under this program.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Information

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations attributable to the net change in operating assets and liabilities for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 was as follows (in millions):

------------------------------------------ ---- ----- ---- ----- ---- ---- ------ - - -----

 2018 2017 2016
(Increase) decrease in accounts receivable $ (6.2 ) $ 83.2 $ 222.4

Decrease in liabilities (9.0 ) (3.8 ) (125.8 )
 $ (18.0 ) $ 65.4 $ 140.6

During periods in which our business contracts, resulting in significantly lower revenues and expenses as compared to the prior year, we typically generate positive cash flows from the net change in operating assets and liabilities as the impact from the collection of receivables that were accrued during the prior period is generally larger than the impact from the payment of expenses incurred in the prior period. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our business contracted significantly as compared to the respective prior year periods resulting in positive cash generated from the net change in operating assets and liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our business contracted at a more moderate pace, resulting in modest negative cash flows from the net change in operating assets and liabilities.

Cash paid for interest and income taxes for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 was as follows (in millions):

------------------------------------ ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - -----

 2018 2017 2016
Interest, net of amounts capitalized $ 232.6 $ 199.8 $ 264.8
Income taxes 58.4 62.8 56.4

Capitalized interest totaled $62.6 million, $72.5 million and $45.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital expenditure accruals totaling $27.8 million, $234.3 million and $11.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were excluded from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In January 2018, we made a $207.4 million milestone payment for ENSCO 123 and the remaining unpaid balance of $9.0 million is due upon delivery. The $207.4 million milestone payment was invoiced and included in accounts payable - trade as of December 31, 2017 on our consolidated balance sheet.

Concentration of Risk

We are exposed to credit risk relating to our receivables from customers, our cash and cash equivalents, investments and our use of derivatives in connection with the management of foreign currency exchange rate risk. We mitigate our credit risk relating to receivables from customers, which consist primarily of major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies, by performing ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain reserves for potential credit losses, which generally have been within our expectations. We mitigate our credit risk relating to cash and investments by focusing on diversification and quality of instruments. Short-term investments consist of a portfolio of time deposits held with several well-capitalized financial institutions, and we monitor the financial condition of those financial institutions.

We mitigate our credit risk relating to counterparties of our derivatives through a variety of techniques, including transacting with multiple, high-quality financial institutions, thereby limiting our exposure to individual counterparties and by entering into ISDA Master Agreements, which include provisions for a legally enforceable master netting agreement, with our derivative counterparties. See "Note 7 - Derivative Instruments" for additional information on our derivative activity.

 The terms of the ISDA agreements may also include credit support requirements, cross default provisions, termination events or set-off provisions. Legally enforceable master netting agreements reduce credit risk by providing protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and generally permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. CSX's investment of $943 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as investment in Conrail. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2019 $ 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 2023 27 Thereafter 20 Total $ 155 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $343 million as of December 2018. The following table discloses amounts related to Conrail. Purchase price amortization and equity earnings are included in equity earnings of affiliates and all other ...

(5) This reflects a reduction of interest expense associated with the fair value mark-up of debt acquired in the RSC acquisition. --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (6) As discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, this primarily reflects severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. --- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ (7) This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets in connection with our restructuring programs. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...
