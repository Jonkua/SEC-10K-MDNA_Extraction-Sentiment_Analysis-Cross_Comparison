Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.
Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, excluding interest expense, net, corporate items, net, corporate special items, net, and non-operating pension expense.
External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

NOTE 14 VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

In connection with the 2006 sale of approximately 5.6 million acres of forestlands, International Paper received installment notes (the Timber Notes) totaling approximately $4.8 billion.

The Timber Notes were used as collateral for borrowings from third party lenders, which effectively monetized the Timber Notes through the creation of newly formed special purposes entities (the Entities). The monetization structure preserved the tax deferral that resulted from the 2006 forestlands sales. As of December 31, 2018, this deferred tax liability was $884 million.

During 2015, International Paper initiated a series of actions in order to extend the 2006 monetization structure and maintain the long-term nature of the deferred tax liability. The Entities, with assets and liabilities primarily consisting of the Timber Notes and third-party bank loans (the Extension Loans), were restructured which resulted in the formation of wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities (the 2015 Financing Entities).

The Timber Notes are shown in Financial assets of special purpose entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and mature in August 2021 unless extended for an additional five years. These notes, which do not require principal payments prior to their maturity, are supported by approximately $4.8 billion of irrevocable letters of credit.

The Extension Loans are shown in Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and mature in the fourth quarter of 2020. These bank loans, totaling approximately $4.2 billion, are nonrecourse to the Company, and are secured by approximately $4.8 billion of Timber Notes, the irrevocable letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes and approximately $150 million of International Paper debt obligations. The $150 million of International Paper debt obligations are eliminated in the consolidation of the 2015 Financing Entities and are not reflected in the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Provisions of loan agreements related to approximately $1.1 billion of the Extension Loans require the bank issuing letters of credit supporting the Timber Notes pledged as collateral to maintain a credit rating at or above a specified threshold. In the event the credit rating of the letter of credit bank is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit must be replaced within 60 days with letters of credit from a qualifying financial institution.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of the Timber Notes was $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, and the fair value of the Extension Loans was $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion for the years ended 2018 and 2017. The Timber Notes and Extension Loans are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in Note 16.

Activity between the Company and the 2015 Financing Entities was as follows:

----------------- ---- ---- ---- - --- - --

In millions 2018 2017 2016
Revenue (a) $ 95 $ 95 $ 95
Expense (a) 128 128 128

Cash payments (c) 128 128 98

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) The revenue and expense are included in Interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) The cash receipts are interest received on the Financial assets of special purpose entities.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) The cash payments represent interest paid on Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities.

In connection with the acquisition of Temple-Inland in February 2012, two special purpose entities became wholly-owned subsidiaries of International Paper.

The use of the two wholly-owned special purpose entities discussed below preserved the tax deferral that resulted from the 2007 Temple-Inland timberlands sales. As of December 31, 2018, this deferred tax liability was $538 million, which will be settled with the maturity of the notes in 2027.

In October 2007, Temple-Inland sold 1.55 million acres of timberland for $2.4 billion. The total consideration consisted almost entirely of notes due in 2027 issued by the buyer of the timberland, which Temple-Inland contributed to two wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entities. The notes are shown in Financial assets of special purpose entities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and are supported by $2.4 billion of irrevocable letters of credit issued by three banks, which are required to maintain minimum credit ratings on their long-term debt. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of the notes was $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. These notes are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in Note 16.

In December 2007, Temple-Inland's two wholly-owned special purpose entities borrowed $2.1 billion which is shown in Nonrecourse financial liabilities of special purpose entities. The loans are repayable in 2027 and are secured by the $2.4 billion of notes and the irrevocable letters of credit securing the notes, and are nonrecourse to us. The loan agreements provide that if a credit rating of any of the banks issuing the letters of credit is downgraded below the specified threshold, the letters of credit issued by that bank must be replaced within 30 days with letters of credit from another qualifying financial institution. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of this debt was $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended 2018 and 2017, respectively. This debt is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, which is further defined in Note 16.
