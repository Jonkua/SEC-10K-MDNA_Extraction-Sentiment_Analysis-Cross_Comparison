Management’s Overview of 2018 Financial Performance
Overall, we had an outstanding year in 2018, which was marked by higher net interest and core fee income, increased investment securities and equity warrant gains, strong total client funds growth, healthy loan growth and stable credit quality. Additionally, we saw higher noninterest expense, primarily from increased compensation and benefits expenses, as well as increased professional services expenses reflective of increased expenses to support our domestic and global expansion initiatives, including our acquisition of SVB Leerink which closed on January 4, 2019, as well as investments made in projects, systems, and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives and other operating costs. In addition, we benefited from tax relief legislation which lowered our federal corporate tax rate by fourteen basis points.
Our core business continued to perform well as a result of our ongoing focus on innovation companies and their investors and continued efforts to secure client relationships. We saw continued success in working with private equity/venture capital firms and life science/healthcare clients as well as clients in our private banking division.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. We have identified three policies as being critical because they require us to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our critical accounting policies include those that address the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and allowance for unfunded credit commitments, measurements of fair value, and the valuation of equity warrant assets. Our senior management has discussed and reviewed the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
We disclose our method and approach for each of our critical accounting policies in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. We consider our accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses to be critical as our estimation of the allowance involves material estimates by us and is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near-term. Determining the allowance for loan losses requires us to make forecasts that are highly uncertain and require a high degree of judgment. Our loan loss reserve methodology is applied to our loan portfolio and we maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels that we believe are appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. A committee comprised of senior management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
Our allowance for loan losses is established for loan losses that are probable and incurred but not yet realized. The process of anticipating loan losses is inherently imprecise. We apply a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. At the time of approval, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating through an evaluation process, which includes consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values, potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. The credit risk ratings for each loan are monitored and updated on an ongoing basis.
The allowance for loan losses is based on a formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans by client industry sector and individually for impaired loans. Our formula allocation is determined on a quarterly basis by utilizing a historical loan loss migration model, which is a statistical model used to estimate an appropriate allowance for outstanding loan balances by calculating the likelihood of a loan being charged-off based on its credit risk rating using historical loan performance data from our portfolio. The formula allocation provides the average loan loss experience for each portfolio segment, which considers our quarterly historical loss experience since the year 2000, both by risk-rating category and client industry sector. The resulting loan loss factors for each risk-rating category and client industry sector are ultimately applied to the respective period-end client loan balances for each corresponding risk-rating category by client industry sector to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan losses.
We also supplement our allowance by applying qualitative allocations to the results we obtained through our historical loan loss migration model to ascertain the total allowance for loan losses. These qualitative allocations are based upon management's assessment of the risks that may lead to a loan loss experience different from our historical loan loss experience. These risks are aggregated to become our qualitative allocation. Refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a summary of the factors management considers for its qualitative allocation as part of management's estimate of the changing risks in the lending environment. In 2016, we made certain enhancements to factors included in our qualitative allocation. We changed from a total loan portfolio weighted average loss factor to a portfolio segment specific loss factor for our estimated reserve floor for portfolio segments that would not draw a minimum reserve based on the lack of historical loan loss experience. Additionally, in response

42

Table of Contents

to increased average borrowing amounts by our clients, we increased our definition of a large loan used for our qualitative reserve for large funded loan exposure.
Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments
The allowance for unfunded credit commitments is determined using a methodology that is inherently similar to the methodology used for calculating the allowance for loan losses adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at funding. Our reserve methodology for unfunded loan commitments applies segment specific historical loss experience for our funded loan portfolio and segment specific probability of funding factors to estimate the allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments also includes certain qualitative allocations as deemed appropriate by management. We consider our accounting policy for the allowance for unfunded credit commitments to be critical as estimation of the reserve involves material estimates by management and is susceptible to changes in the near term. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments equals management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
Fair Value Measurements
We use fair value measurements to record fair value for certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. We disclose our method and approach for fair value measurements of assets and liabilities in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable and the significance of the level of the input to the entire measurement. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels for measuring fair value are defined in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value (Level 1 measurements). When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. For inactive markets, there is little information, if any, to evaluate if individual transactions are orderly. Accordingly, we are required to estimate, based upon all available facts and circumstances, the degree to which orderly transactions are occurring and provide more weighting to price quotes that are based upon orderly transactions (Level 2 measurements). In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement (Level 3 measurements). Significant judgment is required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or Level 3. When making this judgment, we consider available information and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. The classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instrument's fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greater for financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3.
The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts measured using significant Level 3 inputs at December 31, 2018 and 2017:

----------------------------------------------- ------------- --------- ------- --- ------------- ------- ------- - --- ---------- - - -------

Table of Contents

Financial assets valued using Level 3 measurements consist of our non-marketable securities (investments in venture capital) and equity warrant assets (rights to shares of private and public company capital stock). The valuation techniques of our non-marketable securities carried under fair value accounting and equity warrant assets involve a significant degree of management judgment. Refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a summary of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used for each class of Level 3 assets.
The inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying companies, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the underlying companies, general volatility and interest rate market factors, and legal and contractual restrictions. The timing and amount of actual net proceeds, if any, from the disposition of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including investor demand for IPOs, levels of M&A activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell, and the perceived and actual performance of portfolio companies. All of these factors are difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will realize the full value of these securities, which could result in significant losses.
During 2018, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $88.4 million (which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), primarily due to gains on exercised warrant assets. During 2017 and 2016, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $55.2 million and $38.1 million (which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), respectively.
Derivative Assets-Equity Warrant Assets
As discussed above, the valuation of our equity warrant assets is a Level 3 measurement, which requires a significant degree of management judgment in order to value the assets. Our equity warrant asset policy is also considered a critical policy due to the variability of returns from our shares of private and public companies and due to the degree of management judgment in selecting a valuation technique for our equity warrant assets.
The timing and value realized from the disposition of equity warrant assets depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for IPOs, fluctuations in the price of the underlying common stock of these private and public companies, levels of M&A activity, and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. All of these factors are difficult to predict. Many equity warrant assets may be terminated or may expire without compensation and may incur valuation losses from lower-priced funding rounds. We are unable to predict future gains or losses with accuracy, and gains or losses could vary materially from period to period.
Additionally, while management has selected the valuation methodology that it believes provides the best estimate of fair value, there are several acceptable valuation techniques as well as alternative approaches for the calculation of significant inputs for the valuation technique. In the event that a different valuation technique or approach for calculating a significant input were to be used, then the estimated values of these assets could differ significantly from the existing values recorded. Further, the inherent uncertainty of valuing assets for which a ready market is unavailable may cause our estimated values of these assets to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the assets existed, and those differences could be material and ultimately, the recorded fair value of equity warrant assets may never be realized, which could result in significant losses.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Income and Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income is defined as the difference between: (i) interest earned from loans, fixed income investments in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios and short-term investment securities, and, (ii) interest paid on funding sources. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable loans and securities and tax-exempt securities based on the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 percent for 2018 and 35.0 percent for 2017.
Analysis of Net Interest Income Changes Due to Volume and Rate (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume change.” Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “rate change.” The following table sets forth changes in interest income

for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and rate changes for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

Net Interest Income (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
2018 compared to 2017
Net interest income increased by $479.7 million to $1.9 billion in 2018, compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. Overall, the increase in our net interest income was due primarily to both higher average loan and investment portfolio balances as well as higher interest rates.
 The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2018, compared to 2017, are discussed below:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest income for 2018 increased by $510.9 million primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $332.7 million increase in interest income from loans to $1.4 billion in 2018, compared to $1.0 billion in 2017. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $4.5 billion and an increase in the overall yield on our loan portfolio of 45 basis points to 5.30 percent from 4.85 percent. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, increased by 55 basis points to 4.77 percent from 4.22 percent, reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases, partially offset by the strong growth of our lower yielding private equity/venture capital loan portfolio. Our private equity/venture capital portfolio represented 49.5 percent and 42.8 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $164.5 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to $585.4 million in 2018, compared to $420.9 million in 2017. The increase was reflective of an increase of $2.4 billion in average fixed income investment balances as a result of strong deposit growth in 2018 and an increase in our fixed income securities yield of 48 basis points to 2.36 percent from 1.88 percent. The increase in our fixed income securities yield was primarily from higher reinvestment yields on maturing fixed income investments as well as higher yields on new purchases due to interest rate increases, and

◦ A $13.7 million increase in interest income from our Federal Reserve deposits to $35.2 million, compared to $21.5 million in 2017. The increase was due primarily to higher yields as a result of rate increases in 2018.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest expense for 2018 increased to $75.9 million, compared to $44.8 million for 2017, primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $20.6 million increase in deposits interest expense, due primarily to an increase in interest paid on our interest-bearing money market deposits as a result of market rate adjustments, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $10.5 million increase in borrowings interest expense, due primarily to an increase in our average short-term borrowings balance during 2018 to fund loan growth as a result of the timing of loan funding and deposit activities. The increase in interest expense from short-term borrowings was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from long-term debt reflective of the repayment of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes and the redemption of our Junior Subordinated Debentures in 2017.

2017 compared to 2016
Net interest income increased by $271.7 million to $1.4 billion in 2017, compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. Overall, the increase in our net interest income was due primarily to higher average loan balances.
The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2017, compared to 2016, are discussed below:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest income for 2017 increased by $273.6 million primarily due to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $191.6 million increase in interest income from loans to $1.0 billion in 2017, compared to $834.2 million in 2016. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $2.9 billion and an increase in the overall yield on our loan portfolio of 29 basis points to 4.85 percent from 4.56 percent. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, increased to 4.22 percent from 3.97 percent, reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases, partially offset by the strong growth of our lower yielding private equity/ venture capital and Private Bank loan portfolios. Our private equity/venture capital portfolio represented 42.8 percent and 38.7 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Private Bank loan portfolio represented 11.3 percent and 10.8 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $70.5 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to $420.9 million in 2017, compared to $350.4 million in 2016. The increase was primarily reflective of an increase in our fixed income investment securities yield of 25 basis points to 1.88 percent from 1.63 percent resulting primarily from higher reinvestment yields on maturing fixed income investments as well as higher yields on new purchases due to interest rate increases. Interest income from our fixed income securities also benefited from an increase of $0.9 billion in average investment security balances as a result of strong deposit growth in 2017, and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An $11.4 million increase in interest income from our Federal Reserve deposits to $21.5 million, compared to $10.1 million in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher yields as a result of rate increases in 2017, as well as higher average interest-earning cash balances in 2017.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest expense for 2017 increased to $44.8 million, compared to $42.9 million for 2016, due primarily to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $3.1 million increase in deposits interest expense, due primarily to an increase in interest paid on our interest- bearing money market deposits as a result of market rate adjustments, and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $1.2 million decrease in borrowings interest expense, due to the repayment of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes and the redemption of our Junior Subordinated Debentures in 2017.

Net Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Our net interest margin increased by 52 basis points to 3.57 percent in 2018, compared to 3.05 percent in 2017 and 2.72 percent in 2016.
2018 compared to 2017
The increase in our net interest margin in 2018 was reflective primarily of the impact of rising interest rates and the continued shift in the mix of average interest-earning assets towards our higher yielding loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our loan portfolio comprised 48 percent of our average interest-earning assets, an increase from 45 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017.

(1) Our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was modified from prior period's presentation to conform to the current period presentation, which reflect our provision for loan losses and provision for unfunded credit commitments together as our “provision for credit losses.”

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The “allowance for unfunded credit commitments” is included as a component of “Other liabilities.”

The provision for credit losses is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded credit commitments. Our provision for loan losses is a function of our reserve methodology, which is used to determine an appropriate allowance for loan losses for the period. Our reserve methodology is based on our evaluation of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total gross loans using historical and other objective information, and on our qualitative assessment of the inherent and identified credit risk of the loan portfolio. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments is determined using a methodology that is similar to the methodology used for calculating the allowance for loan losses, adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at funding. Our provision for credit losses equals our best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolios at the balance sheet date. For a more detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above, “Consolidated Financial Condition-Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan Losses” below and Note 9—“Loans, Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on our allowance for loan losses.
Provision for Loan Losses

Table of Contents

 We had a provision for loan losses of $84.3 million in 2018, compared to a provision of $85.9 million in 2017 and a provision of $95.7 million in 2016. The provision for loan losses of $84.3 million in 2018 was reflective primarily of $46.6 million from period-end loan growth, $39.0 million in net new specific reserves for nonaccrual loans and $26.7 million from charge-offs not specifically reserved for, partially offset by a benefit of $20.7 million from overall improved credit quality of our loan portfolio reflective of the increase of our private equity/venture capital loans, which tend to be of higher credit quality.
The provision for loan losses of $85.9 million in 2017 was reflective primarily of $62.7 million in net new specific reserves for nonaccrual loans and $29.1 million from period-end loan growth, partially offset by a benefit from overall improved credit quality of our loan portfolio reflective of the increase of our private equity/venture capital loans, which tend to be of higher credit quality.
The provision for loan losses of $95.7 million in 2016 was reflective primarily of $37.9 million for charge-offs that did not previously have a specific reserve, $30.9 million for specific reserves on new nonaccrual loans, $29.5 million for period-end loan growth of $3.2 billion, partially offset by a $7.9 million decrease due to enhancements to our loan loss reserve methodology during 2016.
Provision for Unfunded Credit Commitments
We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $3.6 million in 2018, compared to a provision of $6.4 million in 2017 and $11.0 million in 2016. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in 2018 was driven primarily by increased reserves of $7.9 million from growth in unfunded credit commitments, partially offset by a benefit of $4.7 million from overall improved credit quality of our loan portfolio as mentioned above.
We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $6.4 million in 2017. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in 2017 was driven primarily by qualitative allocations based on our loan portfolio being comprised of larger loans and additional reserves as a result of the increase in unfunded credit commitments.
We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $11.0 million in 2016. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in 2016 reflected enhancements in factors used to estimate our allowance for unfunded credit commitments. These enhancements increased our allowance for unfunded credit commitments by $8.1 million, net. The increase was primarily due to higher loss and conversion factors for our software and internet and hardware loan portfolios, partially offset by lower loss factors for our private equity/venture capital loan portfolio.

Noninterest Income
For the year ended December 31, 2018, noninterest income was $745.0 million, compared to $557.2 million and $456.6 million for the comparable 2017 and 2016 periods, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interests was $707.0 million, compared to $527.8 million and $448.5 million for the comparable 2017 and 2016 periods, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, non-GAAP core fee income was $515.9 million, compared to $379.0 million and $316.2 million for the comparable 2017 and 2016 periods, respectively. (See reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used below under "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".)
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance (including, but not limited to, non-GAAP core fee income, non-GAAP noninterest income and non-GAAP net gains on investment securities). These supplemental performance measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirement.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding items that represent income attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries and certain other non-recurring items. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Included in noninterest income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. We recognize, as part of our investment funds management business through SVB Capital, the entire income or loss from funds consolidated in accordance with ASC Topic 810 as discussed in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report. We are required under GAAP to consolidate 100% of the results of

51

Table of Contents

these entities, even though we may own less than 100% of such entities. The relevant amounts attributable to investors other than us are reflected under “Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests” on our statements of income. Where applicable, the tables below for noninterest income and net gains on investment securities exclude noncontrolling interests.
Core fee income is a non-GAAP financial measure, which represents GAAP noninterest income, but excludes certain line items where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control, primarily our net gains (losses) on investment securities and equity warrant assets. Core fee income includes foreign exchange fees, credit card fees, deposit service charges, lending related fees, client investment fees and letters of credit fees.
The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP noninterest income to non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interests for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively:

Gains on Investment Securities, Net
Net gains on investment securities include gains and losses from our non-marketable and other equity securities, which include public equity securities held as a result of exercised equity warrant assets, as well as gains and losses from sales of our AFS debt securities portfolio, when applicable.
Our non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, SPD Silicon Valley Bank Co., Ltd. (the Bank's joint venture bank in China (“SPD-SVB”)), debt funds, private and public portfolio companies and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. We experience variability in the performance of our non-marketable and other equity securities from period to period, which results in net gains or losses on investment securities (both realized and unrealized). This variability is due to a number of factors, including unrealized changes in the values of our investments, changes in the amount of realized gains and losses from distributions, changes in liquidity events and general economic and market conditions. Unrealized gains or losses from non-marketable and other equity securities for any single period are typically driven by valuation changes, and are therefore subject to potential increases or decreases in future periods. Such variability may lead to volatility in the gains or losses from investment securities. As such, our results for a particular period are not necessarily indicative of our expected performance in a future period.
The extent to which any unrealized gains or losses will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of certain sales restrictions to which these equity securities may be subject to (e.g. lock-up agreements), changes in prevailing market prices, market conditions, the actual sales or distributions of securities, and the timing

52

Table of Contents

of such actual sales or distributions, which, to the extent such securities are managed by our managed funds, are subject to our funds' separate discretionary sales/distributions and governance processes.
Our AFS securities portfolio is a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed with the objective of earning an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Though infrequent, sales of debt securities in our AFS securities portfolio may result in net gains or losses and are conducted pursuant to the guidelines of our investment policy related to the management of our liquidity position and interest rate risk.
In 2018, we had net gains on investment securities of $88.1 million, compared to $64.6 million and $51.7 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Non-GAAP net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests were $49.9 million in 2018, compared to $35.4 million and $43.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests of $49.9 million in 2018 were driven by the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $39.9 million from our strategic and other investments portfolio, primarily driven by net unrealized valuation increases in both private and public company investments held in our strategic venture capital funds,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $29.1 million from our managed funds of funds portfolio, related primarily to net unrealized valuation increases in both private and public company investments held by the funds in the portfolio, and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Losses of $25.2 million from our public equity securities portfolio primarily reflective of net losses on sales of shares of Roku, Inc. ("Roku"), from exercised warrants in 2017, which were sold in the first quarter of 2018.

In 2017, we had net gains on investment securities of $64.6 million, compared to $51.7 million in 2016. Non-GAAP net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests were $35.4 million in 2017, compared to $43.4 million in 2016. Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests of $35.4 million in 2017 were driven by the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $17.9 million from our strategic and other investments portfolio, primarily driven by distribution gains from our strategic venture capital fund investments and $3.4 million related to the sale of certain shares relating to one of our direct equity investments,

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $13.0 million from our managed funds of funds portfolio, related primarily to net unrealized valuation increases in the investments held by the funds driven by IPO, M&A and private equity-backed financing activity,

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $9.0 million from our debt funds portfolio, related to net unrealized valuation increases in the investments held by the funds primarily driven by gains of $9.5 million related to the fund's holdings of Roku, which had an IPO during the third quarter of 2017, and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Losses of $5.2 million from our AFS securities portfolio primarily reflective of $8.8 million of net losses on the sale of approximately $0.6 billion of mortgage-backed securities during the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by net gains on sales of shares from exercised warrants in public companies upon expiration of lock-up periods during the quarter.

(1) Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, resulting in the reclassification of public equity securities out of our AFS securities portfolio into our non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio. This guidance was adopted using the modified retrospective method with a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings. As such, prior period amounts have not been restated.

Gains on Equity Warrant Assets, Net
Gains on equity warrant assets, net, were $89.1 million in 2018, compared to $54.6 million in 2017 and $37.9 million in 2016. Net gains on equity warrant assets of $89.1 million in 2018 were primarily due to the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net gains on $58.2 million from the exercises of equity warrant assets in 2018, compared to net gains of $48.3 million in 2017, driven by increased M&A and IPO activity during 2018, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net gains of $36.9 million from changes in warrant valuations in 2018, compared to net gains of $10.7 million in 2017, driven by valuation increases in our private company warrant portfolio and reflective of increased M&A activity during 2018.

Gains on equity warrant assets, net, of $54.6 million in 2017 were primarily due to the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net gains on $48.3 million from the exercises of equity warrant assets in 2017, compared to net gains of $31.2 million in 2016, driven by net gains of $20.7 million from Roku warrants and from increased M&A and IPO activity during 2017, and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net gains of $10.7 million from changes in warrant valuations in 2017, compared to net gains of $9.7 million in 2016, driven by changes in valuations from our private company warrant portfolio during 2017.

Foreign Exchange Fees
Foreign exchange fees were $138.8 million in 2018, compared to $115.8 million and $104.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases in foreign exchange fees were due primarily to increased trade volumes driven by the continuing increase in the number of clients actively managing currency exposure.

 Credit Card Fees
Credit card fees were $94.1 million in 2018, compared to $76.5 million and $68.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases reflect increased client utilization of our credit card products and custom payment solutions provided to new and existing clients. The increase in client utilization reflects initiatives implemented in 2018, which included the simplification of our business credit card and multi-card product offerings and the automation of certain of our credit card processes. The increase in gross revenue generated was partially offset by higher rebate/rewards expense.

Deposit Service Charges
Deposit service charges were $76.1 million in 2018, compared to $58.7 million and $52.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in deposit service charges was attributable to the increase in the number of deposit clients as well as increases in transaction volumes from existing clients and was reflective of the introduction of new product solutions in 2018 as well as enhanced product pricing.
Client Investment Fees
We offer a variety of investment products on which we earn fees. These products include money market mutual funds, overnight repurchase agreements and sweep money market funds available through the Bank, client-directed accounts offered through SVB Securities, our broker dealer subsidiary, and fixed income management services offered through SVB Asset Management and SVB Wealth Advisory, our investment advisory subsidiaries.
Client investment fees were $130.4 million in 2018, compared to $56.1 million and $32.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases were reflective primarily of the large increase in average client investment funds of $23.5 billion and $8.2 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively, driven by our clients’ increased utilization of our off-balance sheet sweep money market funds and products managed by SVB Asset Management. Client investment fees in 2018 also benefited from improved spreads on our client investment funds due to increases in general market rates and the reintroduction of fees, associated with our repurchase agreement program, which had been previously waived due to the low rate environment.

Lending Related Fees
Lending related fees were $41.9 million in 2018, compared to $43.3 million and $33.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was due primarily to an adjustment of $4.5 million, to increase unused commitment fees during 2017, related to fees earned in prior periods from unused lines of credit. Unused loan commitments were $16.7 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $15.5 billion at December 31, 2017 and $15.0 billion at December 31, 2016.

Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit Fees
Letters of credit and standby letters of credit fees were $34.6 million in 2018, compared to $28.5 million and $25.6 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increases were primarily reflective of larger standby letter of credit issuances with our Private Equity/Venture Capital and Corporate Finance clients as leading contributors in 2018. Additionally, we saw higher transaction counts and standby letter of credit renewals in 2018.
Other Noninterest Income
Total other noninterest income was $51.9 million in 2018, compared to income of $59.1 million in 2017 and $50.8 million in 2016. The decrease of $7.2 million in other noninterest income in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease of $5.2 million in service-based fees and other noninterest income reflective of the sale of our equity valuation services business during 2017.
The increase in total other noninterest income of $8.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Higher fund management fees of $21.2 million, as compared to fees of $19.2 million for the comparable 2016 period, attributable primarily to the addition of new managed funds at SVB Capital,

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $6.7 million from correspondent bank rebate income and FHLB/FRB stock dividend income, and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Service-based fee income decreased $4.1 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the sale of our equity valuation services business during 2017.

(1) Our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was modified from prior period's presentation to conform to the current period presentation, which reflect our provision for loan losses and provision for unfunded credit commitments together as our “provision for credit losses.” In prior periods, our provision for unfunded credit commitments were reported separately as a component of noninterest expense.

Included in noninterest expense is expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. See below for a description and reconciliation of non-GAAP noninterest expense and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, both of which exclude noncontrolling interests.
Non-GAAP Noninterest Expense
We use and report non-GAAP noninterest expense, non-GAAP taxable equivalent revenue and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, which excludes noncontrolling interests. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by: (i) excluding certain items that represent expenses attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries, or certain items that do not occur every reporting period; or (ii) providing additional information used by management that is not otherwise required by GAAP or other applicable requirements. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The table below provides a summary of non-GAAP noninterest expense and non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, both net of noncontrolling interests:

Compensation and benefits expense was $727.0 million in 2018, compared to $606.4 million in 2017 and $514.3 million in 2016. The key factors driving the increase in compensation and benefits expense in 2018 were as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $56.3 million in incentive compensation expense due primarily to our strong 2018 full-year performance and reflective of our improved ROE relative to our peers, which is one of our key plan performance metrics,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $47.8 million in salaries and wages expense, reflective primarily of an increase in the number of average FTEs by 289 to 2,685 in 2018, compared to 2,396 in 2017, and annual pay raises. The increase in headcount was primarily to support our overall growth, and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $14.8 million in other employee compensation and benefits, related to various expenses, particularly share-based compensation reflective of the increase in our stock price as well as employer payroll taxes and group health and life insurance reflective of our increased headcount in 2018. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our warrant incentive plan expense in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflective of our exercise of Roku equity warrants in the fourth quarter of 2017 which resulted in a large accrual of warrant incentive compensation expense in 2017 and subsequent decline of Roku's common stock price, which was sold in 2018, resulting in a lower warrant incentive payout than previously accrued for.

The increase in compensation and benefits expense of $92.1 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, was due primarily to the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $32.9 million in other employee compensation and benefits, related to various expenses, particularly personnel contracting expenses, to support our growth both domestically and globally, as well as group health and life insurance and employer payroll taxes reflective of our increased headcount since 2016. The increase in other employee incentives and benefits also includes an increase of $10.4 million in warrant incentive plan expenses reflective of our 2017 equity warrant portfolio performance,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $32.7 million in salaries and wages expense, reflective primarily of an increase in the number of average FTEs by 171 to 2,396 in 2017, compared to 2,225 in 2016, and annual pay raises. The increase in headcount was primarily to support our overall growth, and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $26.6 million in expenses related to incentive compensation plans and ESOP expense due to our strong 2017 full-year performance and reflective of our improved ROE relative to our peers, which is one of our key plan performance metrics.

Our variable compensation plans primarily consist of our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, 401(k) and ESOP Plan, Retention Program and Warrant Incentive Plan. Total costs incurred under these plans were $239.2 million in 2018, compared to $183.9 million in 2017 and $145.3 million in 2016. These amounts are included in total compensation and benefits expense discussed above.

Professional Services
Professional services expense was $158.8 million in 2018, compared to $121.9 million in 2017 and $95.0 million in 2016. The increase in 2018 was primarily related to enhancements in our regulatory, risk management and compliance infrastructure to support our growth both domestically and globally, as well as investments made in projects, systems and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives and other operating costs. Additionally, we incurred $8.8 million of legal and consulting fees in 2018 associated with the acquisition of SVB Leerink.
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment expense was $77.9 million in 2018, compared to $71.8 million in 2017 and $65.5 million in 2016. The increase related to investments in projects, systems and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives as well as other operating costs.
Net Occupancy
Net occupancy expense was $54.8 million in 2018, compared to $48.4 million in 2017 and $39.9 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to lease renewals at higher costs, reflective of market conditions, and the expansion of certain offices to support our growth.
FDIC and State Assessments
FDIC and state assessments expense was $34.3 million in 2018, compared to $35.1 million in 2017 and $30.3 million in 2016. The decrease in FDIC and state assessments expense in 2018 was due primarily to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge for banks effective October 1, 2018, reflective of the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio reaching its minimum funding requirements.

Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the H.R.1, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJ Act"), was signed into law. The TCJ Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to, among other things, reduce tax rates, and make changes to credits and deductions for individuals and businesses. For businesses, the TCJ Act permanently lowers the federal corporate tax rate to 21.0 percent from the existing maximum rate of 35.0 percent, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018.
The Company has also considered the provisions of the TCJ Act related to non-U.S. operations which would potentially impact the Company’s income tax provision. Such provisions include the one-time transition tax (“TT”) on foreign earnings and the new base erosion anti-avoidance tax (“BEAT”). Based on analyses performed by the Company as of December 31, 2018, the impact of both of these provisions continue to have an immaterial impact on the Company’s income tax provision.
Our effective income tax expense rate was 26.5 percent in 2018, compared to 42.0 percent in 2017 and 39.5 percent in 2016. Our effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax expense by the sum of income before income tax expense and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The components of our effective tax rates for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are discussed in Note 16—“Income Taxes” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
The reduction in our effective tax rate for 2018 was primarily due to the lower Federal corporate tax rate as a result of the TCJ Act effective January 1, 2018. The effective tax rate for each of 2018 and 2017 included the recognition of tax benefits of $18.0 million due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.
The increase in our effective tax rate for 2017 was due primarily to one-time increases to tax expense of $33.8 million related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and $3.8 million related to investments in low income housing tax credit funds, incorporating the new federal tax rate related to the TCJ Act. The effective tax rate for the 2017 year also included the recognition of a tax benefit of $18.0 million due to the adoption and implementation of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee

Share-Based Payment Accounting, in the first quarter of 2017. ASU 2016-09 requires tax impacts from employee share-based transactions to be recognized in the provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in-capital in stockholders' equity required under the previous guidance.

Income before income tax expense from our GCB increased to $1.2 billion in 2018, compared to $848.9 million in 2017 and $634.5 million in 2016, which reflected the continued growth of our core commercial business and clients. The key components of GCB's performance are discussed below:
2018 compared to 2017
Net interest income from GCB increased by $349.1 million in 2018, due primarily to an increase in loan interest income resulting from an increase in average loan balances and higher loan yields as well as an increase in FTP earned for an increase in average deposits.
Noninterest income increased by $80.9 million in 2018, related primarily to an increase in our core fees (higher client investment fees, foreign exchange fees, credit card fees and deposit service charges). The increase in client investment fees was due to higher client investment fund balances as well as from improved spreads on our client investment funds due to increases in general market rates. The increase in foreign exchange fees was due primarily to an increase in our client count as well as volume related to increased client engagement. The increase in credit card fees was primarily reflective of increased client utilization of our credit card products and custom payment solutions provided to new and existing clients, partially offset by higher rebate/rewards expense. The increase in deposit service charges was reflective of higher deposit client counts, as well as higher transaction volumes from existing clients.
Noninterest expense increased by $85.5 million in 2018, due primarily to increased expenses for compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expenses increased as a result of higher salaries and wages expenses, higher incentive compensation and higher other employee compensation and benefits. The increase in GCB salaries and wages expenses was due primarily to an increase in the average number of FTEs at GCB, which increased by 183 to 2,022 FTEs in 2018, compared to 1,839 FTEs in 2017. The increase in GCB incentive compensation expense was due to our strong 2018 full-year performance and reflective of our improved ROE relative to our peers, which is one of our key plan performance metrics. The increase in total other employee benefits was related to various expenses, particularly share-based compensation as well as employer payroll taxes and group health and life insurance reflective of our increased headcount in 2018.

2017 compared to 2016
Net interest income from GCB increased by $233.7 million in 2017, primarily due to an increase in loan interest income resulting mainly from an increase in average loan balances and higher loan yields.
Noninterest income increased by $45.4 million in 2017, related primarily to an increase in our core fees (higher foreign exchange fees, client investment fees and credit card fees). The increase in foreign exchange fees was due primarily to an increase in our client count as well as volume related to increased client engagement. The increase in client investment fees was due to higher client investment fund balances, as well as from improved spreads on our client investment funds due to increases in general market rates and the reintroduction of fees that had been previously waived due to the low rate environment. The increase in credit card fees was primarily reflective of increased client utilization of our credit card products and custom payment solutions provided to new and existing clients, partially offset by higher rebate/rewards expense.
Noninterest expense increased by $77.0 million in 2017, due primarily to increased expenses for compensation and benefits and professional services. Compensation and benefits expenses increased as a result of higher salaries and wages expenses, higher incentive compensation and higher other employee compensation and benefits. The increase in GCB salaries and wages expenses was due primarily to an increase in the average number of FTEs at GCB, which increased by 89 to 1,839 FTEs in 2017, compared to 1,750 FTEs in 2016. The increase in GCB incentive compensation expense was due to our strong 2017 full-year performance. Professional services expense also increased in 2017 and was primarily related to enhancements in our regulatory, risk management and compliance infrastructure to support our growth both domestically and globally as well as investments made in projects, systems and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives and other operating costs.

Our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of: (i) an AFS securities portfolio and a HTM securities portfolio, both of which consist of interest-earning fixed income investment securities; and (ii) a non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio, which represents primarily investments managed as part of our funds management business as well as public equity securities held as a result of exercised equity warrant assets. The major components of the change are explained below.
The following table presents a profile of our investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

Available-for-Sale Securities
Period-end AFS securities were $7.8 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2017, and $12.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease of $3.3 billion in 2018 was primarily due to $3.4 billion in paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities and sales of $0.5 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations, partially offset by purchases of new investments of $0.7 billion. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized gains or losses in a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Period-end AFS securities at December 31, 2017 decreased $1.5 billion compared to 2016 primarily due to $3.3 billion in paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities and sales of $0.6 billion of agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations, partially offset by purchases of new investments of $2.4 billion. The paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities of $3.3 billion were comprised of $3.2 billion of fixed-rate securities and $0.1 billion in variable-rate securities. The purchases of new investments of $2.4 billion were primarily comprised of agency backed mortgage securities and U.S. Treasury securities.
The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income securities, carried at fair value, classified as AFS as of December 31, 2018. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities, which are reported at fair value. For U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. agency debentures, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected remaining maturities for certain U.S. agency debentures may occur earlier than their contractual maturities because the note issuers have the right to call outstanding amounts ahead of their contractual maturity. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as AFS typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments. The weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

Held-to-Maturity Securities
Period-end HTM securities were $15.5 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 22.3 percent, compared to $12.7 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was due to new purchases of $4.7 billion, with $3.9 billion of agency backed mortgage securities purchases and $0.8 billion of municipal bond purchases, partially offset by $1.9 billion in portfolio paydowns and maturities.
Period-end HTM securities were $12.7 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.3 billion, or 50.3 percent, compared to $8.4 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was due to new purchases of $6.0 billion, primarily comprised of agency backed mortgage securities, partially offset by paydowns and scheduled maturities of $1.7 billion.
Securities classified as HTM are accounted for at cost with no adjustments for changes in fair value. For securities re-designated as HTM from AFS, the unrealized gains at the date of transfer will continue to be reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity and are being amortized over the life of the securities in a manner consistent with the amortization of a premium or discount.
The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income investment securities classified as HTM as of December 31, 2018. Interest income on certain municipal bonds and notes (non-taxable investments) are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 percent. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities. For U.S. agency debentures, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as HTM typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments. The weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

Portfolio duration is a standard measure used to approximate changes in the market value of fixed income instruments due to a change in market interest rates. The measure is an estimate based on the level of current market interest rates, expectations for changes in the path of forward rates and the effect of forward rates on mortgage prepayment speed assumptions. As such, portfolio duration will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Changes in portfolio duration are also impacted by changes in the mix of longer versus shorter term-to-maturity securities. At December 31, 2018, our estimated fixed income securities portfolio weighted-average duration was 3.8 years, compared to 3.0 and 2.5 years at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Non-Marketable and Other Equity Securities
Non-marketable and other equity securities were $941.1 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $290.0 million, or 44.6 percent, compared to $651.1 million at December 31, 2017, which increased by $28.5 million, or 4.6 percent, compared to $622.6 million at December 31, 2016. Included in our non-marketable and other equity securities carried under fair value accounting are amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests. We are required under GAAP to consolidate certain SVB Capital funds, even though we may own less than 100 percent of such entities. See below for a summary of the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other equity securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG.
The increase in non-marketable and other equity securities of $290.0 million in 2018 was related primarily to new investments and the adoption of ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which required equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) to be measured at fair value and eliminated the cost method of accounting. As part of this adoption we recorded an adjustment to opening retained earnings for cost method investments measured at NAV and increased the carrying value of our unconsolidated venture capital and private equity fund investments by $103.1 million. Additionally, we increased our investments in qualified affordable housing projects by $144.4 million, net of amortization.
The increase in non-marketable and other equity securities of $28.5 million in 2017 was related primarily to a $61.8 million net increase in investments in our qualified affordable housing projects portfolio, offset by sales of, and distributions in, our strategic and other investments.
The following table summarizes the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other equity securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG (which generally represents the carrying value times our ownership percentage) at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

(2) The carrying values represented investments in 213 and 235 funds (primarily venture capital funds) at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, where our ownership interest is typically less than 5% of the voting interests of each such fund and in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the partnerships operating activities and financial policies. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities which eliminated the concept of cost method accounting. On a prospective basis, we will carry our unconsolidated venture capital and private equity fund investments at fair value based on the fund investments' net asset values per share as obtained from the general partners of the investments. For each fund investment, we adjust the net asset value per share for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment’s net asset value by using the most recently available financial information from the investee general partner, for example June 30th, for our September 30th consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period. We recorded a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings on January 1, 2018 for the difference between fair value and cost for these fund investments. The estimated fair value and carrying value of these venture capital and private equity fund investments was $201.1 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2017, these investments were carried at cost and had a carrying value of $98.5 million.

(3) Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which eliminated the concept of cost method accounting. On a prospective basis, we will report our other investments in the line item "Other investments without a readily determinable fair value." These investments include direct equity investments in private companies. The carrying value is based on the price at which the investment was acquired plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. We consider a range of factors when adjusting the fair value of these investments, including, but not limited to, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment and a discount for certain investments that have lock-up restrictions or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted. For further details on the carrying value of these investments refer to Note 8—“Investment Securities" of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

(4) Investments classified as other equity securities (fair value accounting) represent shares held in public companies as a result of exercising public equity warrant assets and direct equity investments in public companies held by our consolidated funds. Effective January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2016-01 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. Prior to January 1, 2018, we reported equity securities in public companies that we held as a result of exercising public equity warrant assets in available-for-sale securities. On a prospective basis, these equity securities will be reported in non-marketable and other equity securities.

Volcker Rule

On June 6, 2017, we received notice that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve approved the Company’s application for an extension of the permitted conformance period for the Company’s investments in “illiquid” covered funds. The approval extends the deadline by which the Company must sell, divest, restructure or otherwise conform such investments to the provisions of the Volcker Rule until the earlier of (i) July 21, 2022 or (ii) the date by which each fund matures by its terms or is otherwise conformed to the Volcker Rule.
As implemented under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Volcker Rule prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, a banking entity, such as the Company, from sponsoring or investing in covered funds, defined to include many venture capital and private equity funds. As noted above, the Company currently maintains certain investments deemed to be prohibited investments in “illiquid” covered funds, which are now covered under the approved extension. As of December 31, 2018, such prohibited investments had an estimated aggregate carrying value and fair value of approximately $247 million. (For more information about the Volcker Rule, see "Business - Supervision and Regulatory - Proprietary Trading and Certain Relationships with Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds" under Part I, Item I of this report.)

The credit profile of our loan portfolio clients varies based on the nature of the lending we do for different market segments. Our three main market segments are (i) technology (software/internet and hardware) and life science/healthcare, (ii) private equity/venture capital, and (iii) SVB Private Bank.

Table of Contents

(i) Technology and Life Science/Healthcare
 Our technology and life science/healthcare loan portfolios include loans to clients at the various stages of their life cycles and represent the largest segments of our loan portfolio. The primary underwriting method for our technology and life science/healthcare portfolios are classified as investor dependent, balance sheet dependent, or cash flow dependent.

Investor dependent loans represented a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at 11 percent of total gross loans at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. These loans are made to companies in both our Accelerator (early-stage) and Growth practices. Investor dependent loans typically have modest or negative cash flows and no established record of profitable operations. Repayment of these loans may be dependent upon receipt by borrowers of additional equity financing from venture capital firms or others, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party or an IPO. Venture capital firms may provide financing selectively, at reduced amounts, or on less favorable terms, which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers' ability to repay their loans to us. When repayment is dependent upon the next round of venture investment and there is an indication that further investment is unlikely or will not occur, it is often likely that the company would need to be sold to repay the debt in full. If reasonable efforts have not yielded a likely buyer willing to repay all debt at the close of the sale or on commercially viable terms, the account will most likely be deemed to be impaired.

Balance sheet dependent loans, which includes asset-based loans, represented eight percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2018 compared to 10 percent at December 31, 2017. Balance sheet dependent loans are structured to require constant current asset coverage (i.e. cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and, to a much lesser extent, inventory) in an amount that exceeds the outstanding debt. These loans are generally made to companies in our Growth and Corporate Finance practices. Our asset-based lending, which includes working capital lines and accounts receivable financing, represented two and one percent of total gross loans as of December 31, 2018 , respectively, and both represented three percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2017. The repayment of these arrangements is dependent on the financial condition, and payment ability, of third parties with whom our clients do business.

Cash flow dependent loans, which include sponsored buyout lending, represented 16 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2018, compared to 19 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2017. Cash flow dependent loans require the borrower to maintain cash flow from operations that is sufficient to service all debt. Borrowers must demonstrate normalized cash flow in excess of all fixed charges associated with operating the business. Sponsored buyout loans represented eight percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2018, compared to nine percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2017. These loans are typically used to assist a select group of experienced private equity sponsors with the acquisition of businesses, are larger in size, and repayment is generally dependent upon the cash flows of the acquired company. The acquired companies are typically established, later-stage businesses of scale and characterized by reasonable levels of leverage and loan structures that include meaningful financial covenants. The sponsor's equity contribution is often 50 percent or more of the acquisition price.

(ii) Private Equity/Venture Capital
We also provide financial services to clients in the private equity/venture capital community. At December 31, 2018, our lending to private equity/venture capital firms and funds represented 50 percent of total gross loans, compared to 43 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2017. The vast majority of this portfolio consists of capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms. These facilities are generally governed by meaningful financial covenants oriented towards ensuring that the funds' remaining callable capital is sufficient to repay the loan, and larger commitments (typically provided to larger private equity funds) are often secured by an assignment of the general partner's right to call capital from the fund's limited partner investors.

(iii) SVB Private Bank
Our SVB Private Bank clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies. Our lending to SVB Private Bank clients represented 11 percent of total gross loans at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Many of these clients have mortgages, which represented 86 percent of this portfolio at December 31, 2018; the balance of this portfolio consisted of home equity lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, capital call lines of credit, and other secured and unsecured lending.

State Concentrations
Approximately 28 percent and 10 percent of our outstanding total gross loan balances as of December 31, 2018 were to borrowers based in California and New York, respectively, compared to 31 percent and 10 percent as of December 31, 2017. Other than California and New York, there are no states with gross loan balances greater than or equal to 10 percent.

Upon maturity, loans satisfying our credit quality standards may be eligible for renewal. Such renewals are subject to the normal underwriting and credit administration practices associated with new loans. We do not grant loans with unconditional extension terms.

77

Table of Contents

Loan Administration
The Credit Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our credit risks and strategies, as well as our key credit policies and lending practices.
Subject to the oversight of the Credit Committee, lending authority is delegated to the Chief Credit Officer and our management's Loan Committee, which consists of the Chief Credit Officer and other senior members of our lending management. Requests for new and existing credit extensions that meet certain size and underwriting criteria may be approved outside of our Loan Committee by designated senior lenders or jointly with a senior credit officer or division risk manager.
Credit Quality Indicators
As of both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our total criticized loans and impaired loans represented four percent of our total gross loans. Criticized loans and impaired loans to early-stage clients represented 19 percent and 22 percent of our total criticized loans and impaired loan balances at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Loans to early-stage clients represent a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at six percent of total gross loans at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. It is common for an early-stage client’s remaining liquidity to fall temporarily below the threshold for a pass-rated credit during its capital-raising period for a new round of funding. Based on our experience, for most early-stage clients, this situation typically lasts one to two quarters and generally resolves itself with a subsequent round of venture funding, though there are exceptions, from time to time. As a result, we expect that each of our early-stage clients will reside in our criticized portfolio during a portion of their life cycle.

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets consist of loans on nonaccrual status, loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest, and Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) and other foreclosed assets. We measure all loans placed on nonaccrual status for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or the net present value of the expected cash flows. The table below sets forth certain data and ratios between nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses:

Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans decreased 11 basis points to 0.99 percent at December 31, 2018, compared to 1.10 percent at December 31, 2017. The decrease was reflective of a six basis point decrease in the reserves for gross performing loans and a five basis point decrease in the reserves for nonaccrual loans. Our reserve percentage for performing loans as a percentage of total gross performing loans decreased to 0.86 percent at December 31, 2018, compared to 0.92 percent at December 31, 2017, reflective of the continued shift in the mix of our overall loan portfolio to our higher quality private equity/venture capital loan portfolio. Our reserve percentage for nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total gross loans decreased to 0.13 percent at December 31, 2018, compared to 0.18 percent at December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of charge-offs of previously reserved nonaccrual loans.

Charge-offs (43,857 ) (55,076 )
Other reductions (99 ) (2 )
Balance, end of period $ 94,142 $ 119,259

Our nonaccrual loan balance decreased $25.2 million to $94.1 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $119.3 million at December 31, 2017. The $25.2 million decrease was primarily attributable to our hardware and software/internet loan portfolios. Our hardware nonaccrual loan portfolio decreased $14.9 million primarily due to a $10.7 million charge-off for one client in our Growth practice. Our software/internet nonaccrual loan portfolio decreased $12.1 million primarily due to paydowns of $6.7 million for one client in our Growth practice and a $7.2 million decrease for one sponsored buyout loan primarily due to partial charge-offs during 2018.
Our nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2018 included $73.1 million from five clients (three software/internet clients represented $56.0 million and two life science/healthcare clients represented $17.1 million). Two of these loans are sponsored buyout loans that were added to our nonaccrual portfolio in 2015, another is a Corporate Finance client that was added during 2016 and two are new nonaccrual loans added during 2018 in our Growth practice. The total credit exposure for these five largest nonaccrual loans was $73.4 million as of December 31, 2018, for which we have specifically reserved $28.0 million.
Average nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $117.1 million, $123.8 million, $108.7 million, $80.3 million, and $24.5 million, respectively. The decrease in average nonaccrual loans was attributable to the decrease in nonaccrual loans from our software/internet and hardware loan portfolio related to charge-offs and paydowns for the three clients mentioned above. If the nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 had not been nonperforming, $7.4 million, $7.7 million, $4.6 million, $4.5 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, in interest income would have been recorded.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Assets
The decrease of $56.5 million in foreign exchange spot contract assets was due to a lower number of unsettled client trades at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017.
Accrued Interest Receivable
The increase of $56.2 million in accrued interest receivable was primarily reflective of the strong growth of our loans. Period-end loan balances were $28.3 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion, or 22.6 percent, as compared to December 31, 2017.
Other Assets
Other assets includes various asset amounts for other operational transactions. The increase of $49.0 million was primarily due to a $24.7 million increase in current tax receivable due to the payment in excess of the current quarter's tax provision. Prepaid assets also increased $18.1 million primarily due to the annual timing of prepaid software agreement renewals.

Derivatives
Derivative instruments are recorded as a component of other assets and other liabilities on the balance sheet. The following table provides a summary of derivative assets and liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017:

Equity Warrant Assets
In connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of equity warrant assets in primarily private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. At December 31, 2018, we held warrants in 2,095 companies, compared to 1,868 companies at December 31, 2017. Warrants in 18 companies each had values greater than $1.0 million and collectively represented $46.9 million, or 31.4 percent, of the fair value of the total warrant portfolio. The change in fair value of equity warrant assets is recorded in gains on equity

Foreign Exchange Forward and Foreign Currency Option Contracts
We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in foreign activities, either as the purchaser or seller, depending upon the clients' need. For each forward or option contract entered into with our clients, we enter into an opposite way forward or option contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in currency rates. We also enter into forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure related to certain foreign currency denominated instruments. Net gains and losses on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated instruments are recorded in the line item "Other" as part of noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. We have not experienced nonperformance by any of our counterparties and therefore have not incurred any related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties. Our net exposure for foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts, net of cash collateral, was $20.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $65.6 million at December 31, 2017. For additional information on our foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, see Note 13—“Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Client Interest Rate Derivatives
We sell interest rate contracts to clients who wish to mitigate their interest rate exposure. We economically reduce the interest rate risk from this business by entering into opposite way contracts with correspondent banks. Our net exposure for client interest rate derivative contracts, net of cash collateral, was $8.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $11.7 million at December 31, 2017. For information on our client interest rate derivatives, refer to Note 13—“Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

The increase in deposits of $5.1 billion in 2018 was driven primarily by a healthy equity funding environment across a majority of our market segments with robust activities in the IPO and secondary public offering markets as well as strong new client acquisition. No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our business. Approximately 16 percent, 14 percent and 12 percent of our total deposits at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were from our clients in Asia.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Liabilities
The decrease of $32.5 million in foreign exchange spot contract liabilities was due to a lower number of unsettled client trades at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017.
Accrued Compensation
Accrued compensation includes amounts for our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive Plan, ESOP and other compensation arrangements. The increase of $56.9 million was primarily the result of larger incentive compensation accruals at December 31, 2018 based on our financial performance for 2018 and the increase in period end full-time employees. For a description of our variable compensation plans, refer to Note 17—“Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Other Liabilities
Other liabilities increased $77.3 million to $458.4 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $381.1 million at December 31, 2017, reflective primarily of a $104.8 million net increase in new commitments for our qualified affordable tax credit funds, partially offset by a decrease of $26.3 million in deferred fund management fees for our SVB Capital funds as a result of the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018.

Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests totaled $148.6 million and $139.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was due to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $37.5 million partially offset by net capital distributions of $28.5 million primarily to investors in our managed funds of funds for the year ended December 31, 2018. For more information, refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Capital Resources
We maintain an adequate capital base to support anticipated asset growth, operating needs, and credit and other business risks, and to provide for SVB Financial and the Bank to be in compliance with applicable regulatory capital guidelines, including the joint agency rules implementing the "Basel III" capital rules. Our primary sources of new capital include retained earnings and proceeds from the sale and issuance of our capital stock or other securities. In consultation with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, management engages in regular capital planning processes in an effort to optimize the use of the capital available to us and to appropriately plan for our future capital needs. The capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and allocates capital to both existing and future business activities. Expected future use or activities for which capital may be set aside include balance sheet growth and associated relative increases in market or credit exposure, investment activity, potential product and business expansions, acquisitions and strategic or infrastructure investments. In addition, we conduct capital stress tests as part of our annual capital planning process. The capital stress tests allow us to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on our capital adequacy position.
Common Stock
On November 13, 2018, the Company announced the Stock Repurchase Program to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the Stock Repurchase Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements, availability of funds, and other relevant considerations, as determined by the Company. The Stock Repurchase Program expires on November 15, 2019. From time to time, we may implement a non-discretionary trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, under which we will automatically repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a predetermined formula for a specific period of time.
Through December 31, 2018, we repurchased and retired 715,207 shares of our outstanding common stock totaling $147.1 million. At December 31, 2018, $352.9 million remains available to repurchase stock under the Stock Repurchase Program.
SVBFG Stockholders’ Equity
SVBFG stockholders’ equity totaled $5.1 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $936.4 million, or 22.4 percent compared to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily the result of net income of $973.8 million in 2018, a net increase to equity of $68.8 million related to the adoption of new accounting guidance, and an increase in additional paid-in capital of $64.1 million reflective of the amortization of share-based compensation and the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in retained earnings of $147.1 million related to the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program.
Funds generated through retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to continue to be so in the future.

Capital Ratios
Regulatory capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank exceeded minimum federal regulatory guidelines for a well-capitalized bank holding company and insured depository institution, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. See Note 21—“Regulatory Matters” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. Capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank, compared to the minimum regulatory ratios to be considered “well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized,” are set forth below:

----------------------------------------------------------- ------------ - ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----- ---- ------------------ - ------------------------ ---- - --- -

(2) The FRB has not issued any minimum guidelines for the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio or the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio. However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels and are therefore provided above.

2018 compared to 2017
Risk-based capital ratios (CET 1, tier 1, and total risk-based capital) for SVB Financial and the Bank increased as of December 31, 2018, compared to the same ratios as of December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a proportionally higher increase in capital relative to the increase in our risk-weighted assets during 2018. The increase in capital was reflective primarily of net income of $973.8 million as well as a net increase of $68.8 million related to the adoption of new accounting guidance in 2018, partially offset by a decrease of $147.1 million related to the repurchase of our outstanding common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program. The increase in risk-weighted assets was due primarily to our robust loan growth in 2018.
Both SVB Financial and the Bank's tier 1 leverage ratios increased as of December 31, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017, due to proportionally higher capital relative to average assets growth during 2018. All our reported capital ratios remain above the levels considered to be "well capitalized" under applicable banking regulations.
2017 compared to 2016
The total risk-based capital and tier 1 capital ratios for both SVB Financial and the Bank decreased as of December 31, 2017, as compared to December 31, 2016. The decreases were a result of the proportionally higher increase in our risk-weighted assets compared to the increases in capital during the year ended December 31, 2017. The growth in period-end risk-weighted assets was primarily from period-end loan growth and an increase in fixed income securities. Increased capital was reflective primarily of year-to-date earnings and issuance of common stock related to equity-based employee stock plans resulting from an increase in SVB Financial's stock price during 2017. SVB Financial's tier 1 leverage ratio held flat at 8.34 percent, while the Bank's tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 11 basis points as of December 31, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016. The decrease in tier 1 leverage ratio was reflective of an increase in average assets from period-end loan and investment growth relative to the increase in tier 1 capital, primarily from retained earnings. All of our reported capital ratios were above the levels considered to be “well capitalized” as of December 31, 2017 under applicable banking regulations.

Non-GAAP Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets and Non-GAAP Tangible Common Equity to Risk-weighted Assets
The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios are not required by GAAP or applicable bank regulatory requirements. However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these ratios in evaluating the adequacy of the Company’s capital levels; however, this financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These ratios are calculated by dividing total SVBFG stockholder’s equity, by total period-end assets and risk-weighted assets, after reducing both amounts by acquired intangibles, if any. The manner in which this ratio is calculated varies among companies. Accordingly, our ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar measures of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP:

2018 compared to 2017
SVB Financial's and the Bank's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased due to the proportionally higher increase in tangible common equity relative to changes to tangible assets. Increased capital was reflective primarily of net income. SVB Financial's and the Bank's tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets increased due to the proportionally higher increase in tangible common equity, reflective primarily of net income, relative to changes in risk-weighted assets. The increase in the Bank's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was partially offset as a result of $140.0 million in cash dividends paid by the Bank to our bank holding company, SVB Financial, during 2018. See "SVBFG Stockholders’ Equity" above for further details on changes to the individual components of our equity balance.
2017 compared to 2016
SVB Financial's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased due to the proportionally higher increase in tangible common equity as compared to changes to tangible assets. Increased capital was reflective primarily of net income. The Bank's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio decreased, primarily as a result of $90.0 million in cash dividends paid by the Bank to our bank holding company, SVB Financial, during 2017. SVB Financial's and the Bank's tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets decreased due to the proportionally higher increase in risk-weighted assets relative to the increase in tangible common equity. The growth in period-end risk-weighted assets was primarily due to period-end loan growth and higher investment and cash balances driven by increases in deposits. See "SVBFG Stockholders’ Equity" above for further details on changes to the individual components of our equity balance.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
In the normal course of business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and commercial and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than the contractual amount of these commitments because a significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. Refer to the discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 19—“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
The following table summarizes our unfunded commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018:

Excluded from the tables above are unfunded commitment obligations of $15.3 million to our managed funds of funds and other fund investments for which neither the payment, timing, nor eventual obligation is certain. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule (see "Business - Supervision and Regulation" under Part I, Item 1 of this report), we make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a 10-year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling 100% of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over 5 to 7 years; however in certain cases, the funds may not call 100% of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. Additionally, our consolidated managed funds of funds have $5.8 million of remaining unfunded commitments to venture capital and private equity funds. See Note 8—“Investment Securities" of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further disclosure related to non-marketable and other equity securities. Additional discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements for these fund investments is included in Note 19—“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Liquidity
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations, including, as necessary, paying creditors, meeting depositors’ needs, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities and other operating or capital needs, without incurring undue cost or risk, or causing a disruption to normal operating conditions.
We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business activities. Our Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which is a management committee, provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs. Additionally, we routinely conduct liquidity stress testing as part of our liquidity management practices.
Our deposit base is, and historically has been, our primary source of liquidity. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits may fluctuate from time to time due to a variety of factors, including market conditions, prevailing interest rates, changes in client deposit behaviors, availability of insurance protection, and our offering of deposit products. At December 31, 2018, our period-end total deposit balances increased to $49.3 billion, compared to $44.3 billion at December 31, 2017.
Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations, short-term investment securities maturing within one year, AFS securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of one year and anticipated near-term cash flows from investments.
We have certain facilities in place to enable us to access short-term borrowings on a secured and unsecured basis. Our secured facilities include collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco and the discount window at the FRB (using both fixed income securities and loans as collateral). Our unsecured facility consists of our uncommitted federal funds lines. As of December 31, 2018, collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco was comprised primarily of fixed income investment securities and loans and had a carrying value of $4.4 billion, of which $3.7 billion was available to support additional borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, collateral pledged to the discount window at the FRB was comprised of fixed income investment securities and had a carrying value of $0.9 billion, all of which was unused and available to support additional borrowings. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity for our uncommitted federal funds lines totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity under our master repurchase agreements with various financial institutions totaled $2.9 billion at December 31, 2018.
On a stand-alone basis, SVB Financial’s primary liquidity channels include dividends from the Bank, its portfolio of liquid assets, and its ability to raise debt and capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations described in “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Restrictions on Dividends” under Part I, Item 1 of this report.
Consolidated Summary of Cash Flows
Below is a summary of our average cash position and statement of cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively: (For further details, see our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under "Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" under Part II, Item 8 of this report.)

Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities. The following table presents activity related to Jefferies Group's securitizations that were accounted for as sales in which it had continuing involvement (in millions): ----------------------------------------- --------------------...

Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, India, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. In August 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million. The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The results of RB Foods' operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. We have identified three policies as being critical because they require us to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our critical accounting policies include those that address the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and allowance for unfunded credit commitments, measurements of fair value, and the valuation of equity warrant assets. Our senior management has discussed and reviewed the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
We disclose our method and approach for each of our critical accounting policies in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is management']:
(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2  For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2019, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...

Financial assets valued using Level 3 measurements consist of our non-marketable securities (investments in venture capital) and equity warrant assets (rights to shares of private and public company capital stock). The valuation techniques of our non-marketable securities carried under fair value accounting and equity warrant assets involve a significant degree of management judgment. Refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a summary of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used for each class of Level 3 assets.
The inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying companies, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the underlying companies, general volatility and interest rate market factors, and legal and contractual restrictions. The timing and amount of actual net proceeds, if any, from the disposition of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including investor demand for IPOs, levels of M&A activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell, and the perceived and actual performance of portfolio companies. All of these factors are difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will realize the full value of these securities, which could result in significant losses.
During 2018, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $88.4 million (which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), primarily due to gains on exercised warrant assets. During 2017 and 2016, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $55.2 million and $38.1 million (which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), respectively.
Derivative Assets-Equity Warrant Assets
As discussed above, the valuation of our equity warrant assets is a Level 3 measurement, which requires a significant degree of management judgment in order to value the assets. Our equity warrant asset policy is also considered a critical policy due to the variability of returns from our shares of private and public companies and due to the degree of management judgment in selecting a valuation technique for our equity warrant assets.
The timing and value realized from the disposition of equity warrant assets depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for IPOs, fluctuations in the price of the underlying common stock of these private and public companies, levels of M&A activity, and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. All of these factors are difficult to predict. Many equity warrant assets may be terminated or may expire without compensation and may incur valuation losses from lower-priced funding rounds. We are unable to predict future gains or losses with accuracy, and gains or losses could vary materially from period to period.
Additionally, while management has selected the valuation methodology that it believes provides the best estimate of fair value, there are several acceptable valuation techniques as well as alternative approaches for the calculation of significant inputs for the valuation technique. In the event that a different valuation technique or approach for calculating a significant input were to be used, then the estimated values of these assets could differ significantly from the existing values recorded. Further, the inherent uncertainty of valuing assets for which a ready market is unavailable may cause our estimated values of these assets to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the assets existed, and those differences could be material and ultimately, the recorded fair value of equity warrant assets may never be realized, which could result in significant losses.

Net Interest Income and Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income is defined as the difference between: (i) interest earned from loans, fixed income investments in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios and short-term investment securities, and, (ii) interest paid on funding sources. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable loans and securities and tax-exempt securities based on the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 percent for 2018 and 35.0 percent for 2017.
Analysis of Net Interest Income Changes Due to Volume and Rate (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume change.” Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “rate change.” The following table sets forth changes in interest income

Table of Contents

for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and rate changes for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

Net Interest Income (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
2018 compared to 2017
Net interest income increased by $479.7 million to $1.9 billion in 2018, compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. Overall, the increase in our net interest income was due primarily to both higher average loan and investment portfolio balances as well as higher interest rates.
 The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2018, compared to 2017, are discussed below:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest income for 2018 increased by $510.9 million primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $332.7 million increase in interest income from loans to $1.4 billion in 2018, compared to $1.0 billion in 2017. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $4.5 billion and an increase in the overall yield on our loan portfolio of 45 basis points to 5.30 percent from 4.85 percent. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, increased by 55 basis points to 4.77 percent from 4.22 percent, reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases, partially offset by the strong growth of our lower yielding private equity/venture capital loan portfolio. Our private equity/venture capital portfolio represented 49.5 percent and 42.8 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $164.5 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to $585.4 million in 2018, compared to $420.9 million in 2017. The increase was reflective of an increase of $2.4 billion in average fixed income investment balances as a result of strong deposit growth in 2018 and an increase in our fixed income securities yield of 48 basis points to 2.36 percent from 1.88 percent. The increase in our fixed income securities yield was primarily from higher reinvestment yields on maturing fixed income investments as well as higher yields on new purchases due to interest rate increases, and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $13.7 million increase in interest income from our Federal Reserve deposits to $35.2 million, compared to $21.5 million in 2017. The increase was due primarily to higher yields as a result of rate increases in 2018.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest expense for 2018 increased to $75.9 million, compared to $44.8 million for 2017, primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $20.6 million increase in deposits interest expense, due primarily to an increase in interest paid on our interest-bearing money market deposits as a result of market rate adjustments, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $10.5 million increase in borrowings interest expense, due primarily to an increase in our average short-term borrowings balance during 2018 to fund loan growth as a result of the timing of loan funding and deposit activities. The increase in interest expense from short-term borrowings was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from long-term debt reflective of the repayment of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes and the redemption of our Junior Subordinated Debentures in 2017.

2017 compared to 2016
Net interest income increased by $271.7 million to $1.4 billion in 2017, compared to $1.2 billion in 2016. Overall, the increase in our net interest income was due primarily to higher average loan balances.
The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2017, compared to 2016, are discussed below:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest income for 2017 increased by $273.6 million primarily due to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $191.6 million increase in interest income from loans to $1.0 billion in 2017, compared to $834.2 million in 2016. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $2.9 billion and an increase in the overall yield on our loan portfolio of 29 basis points to 4.85 percent from 4.56 percent. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, increased to 4.22 percent from 3.97 percent, reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases, partially offset by the strong growth of our lower yielding private equity/ venture capital and Private Bank loan portfolios. Our private equity/venture capital portfolio represented 42.8 percent and 38.7 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Private Bank loan portfolio represented 11.3 percent and 10.8 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $70.5 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to $420.9 million in 2017, compared to $350.4 million in 2016. The increase was primarily reflective of an increase in our fixed income investment securities yield of 25 basis points to 1.88 percent from 1.63 percent resulting primarily from higher reinvestment yields on maturing fixed income investments as well as higher yields on new purchases due to interest rate increases. Interest income from our fixed income securities also benefited from an increase of $0.9 billion in average investment security balances as a result of strong deposit growth in 2017, and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An $11.4 million increase in interest income from our Federal Reserve deposits to $21.5 million, compared to $10.1 million in 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher yields as a result of rate increases in 2017, as well as higher average interest-earning cash balances in 2017.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest expense for 2017 increased to $44.8 million, compared to $42.9 million for 2016, due primarily to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $3.1 million increase in deposits interest expense, due primarily to an increase in interest paid on our interest- bearing money market deposits as a result of market rate adjustments, and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $1.2 million decrease in borrowings interest expense, due to the repayment of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes and the redemption of our Junior Subordinated Debentures in 2017.

Net Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Our net interest margin increased by 52 basis points to 3.57 percent in 2018, compared to 3.05 percent in 2017 and 2.72 percent in 2016.
2018 compared to 2017
The increase in our net interest margin in 2018 was reflective primarily of the impact of rising interest rates and the continued shift in the mix of average interest-earning assets towards our higher yielding loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our loan portfolio comprised 48 percent of our average interest-earning assets, an increase from 45 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Operating Segment Results
We have three segments for which we report our financial information: Global Commercial Bank (“GCB”), SVB Private Bank and SVB Capital.

Period-end AFS securities were $7.8 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2017, and $12.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease of $3.3 billion in 2018 was primarily due to $3.4 billion in paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities and sales of $0.5 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations, partially offset by purchases of new investments of $0.7 billion. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized gains or losses in a separate component of stockholders']:

The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income investment securities classified as HTM as of December 31, 2018. Interest income on certain municipal bonds and notes (non-taxable investments) are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 percent. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities. For U.S. agency debentures, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as HTM typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments. The weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

Portfolio duration is a standard measure used to approximate changes in the market value of fixed income instruments due to a change in market interest rates. The measure is an estimate based on the level of current market interest rates, expectations for changes in the path of forward rates and the effect of forward rates on mortgage prepayment speed assumptions. As such, portfolio duration will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Changes in portfolio duration are also impacted by changes in the mix of longer versus shorter term-to-maturity securities. At December 31, 2018, our estimated fixed income securities portfolio weighted-average duration was 3.8 years, compared to 3.0 and 2.5 years at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Non-Marketable and Other Equity Securities
Non-marketable and other equity securities were $941.1 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $290.0 million, or 44.6 percent, compared to $651.1 million at December 31, 2017, which increased by $28.5 million, or 4.6 percent, compared to $622.6 million at December 31, 2016. Included in our non-marketable and other equity securities carried under fair value accounting are amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests. We are required under GAAP to consolidate certain SVB Capital funds, even though we may own less than 100 percent of such entities. See below for a summary of the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other equity securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG.
The increase in non-marketable and other equity securities of $290.0 million in 2018 was related primarily to new investments and the adoption of ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which required equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) to be measured at fair value and eliminated the cost method of accounting. As part of this adoption we recorded an adjustment to opening retained earnings for cost method investments measured at NAV and increased the carrying value of our unconsolidated venture capital and private equity fund investments by $103.1 million. Additionally, we increased our investments in qualified affordable housing projects by $144.4 million, net of amortization.
The increase in non-marketable and other equity securities of $28.5 million in 2017 was related primarily to a $61.8 million net increase in investments in our qualified affordable housing projects portfolio, offset by sales of, and distributions in, our strategic and other investments.
The following table summarizes the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other equity securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG (which generally represents the carrying value times our ownership percentage) at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:

[" These investments include direct equity investments in private companies. The carrying value is based on the price at which the investment was acquired plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. We consider a range of factors when adjusting the fair value of these investments, including, but not limited to, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment and a discount for certain investments that have lock-up restrictions or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted.

Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities. The following table presents activity related to Jefferies Group's securitizations that were accounted for as sales in which it had continuing involvement (in millions): ----------------------------------------- --------------------...

[" under Part I, Item 1 of this report), we make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a 10-year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling 100% of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over 5 to 7 years; however in certain cases, the funds may not call 100% of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. Additionally, our consolidated managed funds of funds have $5.8 million of remaining unfunded commitments to venture capital and private equity funds. See Note 8—“Investment Securities"]:
(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performan...

Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties. Our net exposure for foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts, net of cash collateral, was $20.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $65.6 million at December 31, 2017.

Client Interest Rate Derivatives
We sell interest rate contracts to clients who wish to mitigate their interest rate exposure. We economically reduce the interest rate risk from this business by entering into opposite way contracts with correspondent banks. Our net exposure for client interest rate derivative contracts, net of cash collateral, was $8.7 million at December 31, 2018 and $11.7 million at December 31, 2017.

The increase in deposits of $5.1 billion in 2018 was driven primarily by a healthy equity funding environment across a majority of our market segments with robust activities in the IPO and secondary public offering markets as well as strong new client acquisition. No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our business. Approximately 16 percent, 14 percent and 12 percent of our total deposits at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were from our clients in Asia.

--- --------------------------------
(1) See “Derivatives” section above.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Liabilities
The decrease of $32.5 million in foreign exchange spot contract liabilities was due to a lower number of unsettled client trades at December 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017.
Accrued Compensation
Accrued compensation includes amounts for our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive Plan, ESOP and other compensation arrangements. The increase of $56.9 million was primarily the result of larger incentive compensation accruals at December 31, 2018 based on our financial performance for 2018 and the increase in period end full-time employees. For a description of our variable compensation plans, refer to Note 17—“Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Other Liabilities
Other liabilities increased $77.3 million to $458.4 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $381.1 million at December 31, 2017, reflective primarily of a $104.8 million net increase in new commitments for our qualified affordable tax credit funds, partially offset by a decrease of $26.3 million in deferred fund management fees for our SVB Capital funds as a result of the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2018.

Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests totaled $148.6 million and $139.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was due to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $37.5 million partially offset by net capital distributions of $28.5 million primarily to investors in our managed funds of funds for the year ended December 31, 2018. For more information, refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Capital Resources
We maintain an adequate capital base to support anticipated asset growth, operating needs, and credit and other business risks, and to provide for SVB Financial and the Bank to be in compliance with applicable regulatory capital guidelines, including the joint agency rules implementing the "]:
Note 20. Stockholders' Equity and Noncontrolling Interests 87

[" capital rules. Our primary sources of new capital include retained earnings and proceeds from the sale and issuance of our capital stock or other securities. In consultation with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, management engages in regular capital planning processes in an effort to optimize the use of the capital available to us and to appropriately plan for our future capital needs. The capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and allocates capital to both existing and future business activities. Expected future use or activities for which capital may be set aside include balance sheet growth and associated relative increases in market or credit exposure, investment activity, potential product and business expansions, acquisitions and strategic or infrastructure investments. In addition, we conduct capital stress tests as part of our annual capital planning process. The capital stress tests allow us to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on our capital adequacy position.
Common Stock
On November 13, 2018, the Company announced the Stock Repurchase Program to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the Stock Repurchase Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements, availability of funds, and other relevant considerations, as determined by the Company. The Stock Repurchase Program expires on November 15, 2019. From time to time, we may implement a non-discretionary trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, under which we will automatically repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a predetermined formula for a specific period of time.
Through December 31, 2018, we repurchased and retired 715,207 shares of our outstanding common stock totaling $147.1 million. At December 31, 2018, $352.9 million remains available to repurchase stock under the Stock Repurchase Program.
SVBFG Stockholders’ Equity
SVBFG stockholders’ equity totaled $5.1 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $936.4 million, or 22.4 percent compared to $4.2 billion at December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily the result of net income of $973.8 million in 2018, a net increase to equity of $68.8 million related to the adoption of new accounting guidance, and an increase in additional paid-in capital of $64.1 million reflective of the amortization of share-based compensation and the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in retained earnings of $147.1 million related to the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program.
Funds generated through retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to continue to be so in the future.

However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels and are therefore provided above.

2018 compared to 2017
Risk-based capital ratios (CET 1, tier 1, and total risk-based capital) for SVB Financial and the Bank increased as of December 31, 2018, compared to the same ratios as of December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a proportionally higher increase in capital relative to the increase in our risk-weighted assets during 2018. The increase in capital was reflective primarily of net income of $973.8 million as well as a net increase of $68.8 million related to the adoption of new accounting guidance in 2018, partially offset by a decrease of $147.1 million related to the repurchase of our outstanding common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program. The increase in risk-weighted assets was due primarily to our robust loan growth in 2018.

Liquidity
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations, including, as necessary, paying creditors, meeting depositors’ needs, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities and other operating or capital needs, without incurring undue cost or risk, or causing a disruption to normal operating conditions.
We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business activities. Our Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which is a management committee, provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs. Additionally, we routinely conduct liquidity stress testing as part of our liquidity management practices.
Our deposit base is, and historically has been, our primary source of liquidity. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits may fluctuate from time to time due to a variety of factors, including market conditions, prevailing interest rates, changes in client deposit behaviors, availability of insurance protection, and our offering of deposit products. At December 31, 2018, our period-end total deposit balances increased to $49.3 billion, compared to $44.3 billion at December 31, 2017.
Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations, short-term investment securities maturing within one year, AFS securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of one year and anticipated near-term cash flows from investments.
We have certain facilities in place to enable us to access short-term borrowings on a secured and unsecured basis. Our secured facilities include collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco and the discount window at the FRB (using both fixed income securities and loans as collateral). Our unsecured facility consists of our uncommitted federal funds lines. As of December 31, 2018, collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco was comprised primarily of fixed income investment securities and loans and had a carrying value of $4.4 billion, of which $3.7 billion was available to support additional borrowings. As of December 31, 2018, collateral pledged to the discount window at the FRB was comprised of fixed income investment securities and had a carrying value of $0.9 billion, all of which was unused and available to support additional borrowings. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity for our uncommitted federal funds lines totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity under our master repurchase agreements with various financial institutions totaled $2.9 billion at December 31, 2018.
On a stand-alone basis, SVB Financial’s primary liquidity channels include dividends from the Bank, its portfolio of liquid assets, and its ability to raise debt and capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations described in “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Restrictions on Dividends” under Part I, Item 1 of this report.
Consolidated Summary of Cash Flows
Below is a summary of our average cash position and statement of cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively: (For further details, see our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows under "]:
Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities. The following table presents activity related to Jefferies Group's securitizations that were accounted for as sales in which it had continuing involvement (in millions): ----------------------------------------- --------------------...
