The Centers consist of consolidated Centers (“Consolidated Centers”) and unconsolidated joint venture Centers (“Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers”) as set forth in “Item 2. Properties,” unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Management Companies.

On February 13, 2019, the Company’s joint venture in SanTan Village Regional Center entered into a commitment for a ten-year $220.0 million loan to replace the existing loan on the property. The new loan will bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.30% and is expected to close during the second quarter of 2019.
On February 22, 2019, the Company’s joint venture in The Shops at Atlas Park entered into an agreement to increase the total borrowing capacity of the existing loan on the property from $57.8 million to $80.0 million, and to extend the maturity date to October 28, 2021, including extension options. Concurrent with the loan modification, the joint venture borrowed an additional $18.4 million. The Company used its $9.2 million share of the additional proceeds to pay down its line of credit and for general corporate purposes.
Redevelopment and Development Activity:
The Company's joint venture is proceeding with the redevelopment of Fashion District Philadelphia, an 850,000 square foot shopping center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be completed in September 2019. The total cost of the project is estimated to be between $400.0 million and $420.0 million, with $200.0 million to $210.0 million estimated to be the Company's pro rata share. The Company has funded $151.5 million of the total $302.9 million incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2018.
The Company's joint venture in Scottsdale Fashion Square is redeveloping a former Barney's store and an 80,000 square foot exterior expansion. The project is expected to be completed in 2019. The total cost of the project is estimated to be between $140.0 million and $160.0 million, with $70.0 million to $80.0 million estimated to be the Company's pro rata share. The Company has funded $26.8 million of the total $53.6 million incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2018.
The Company's joint venture with Hudson Pacific Properties is redeveloping One Westside, into 584,000 square feet of creative office space and 96,000 square feet of dining and entertainment space. The entire creative office space has been leased to Google and is expected to be completed in 2022. The total cost of the project is estimated to be between $500.0 million and $550.0 million, with $125.0 million to $137.5 million estimated to be the Company's pro rata share. The Company has funded $35.6 million of the total $142.4 million incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2018.
On September 6, 2018, the Company formed a 50/50 joint venture with Simon Property Group to develop Los Angeles Premium Outlets, a premium outlet center in Carson, California that is planned to open with approximately 400,000 square feet, followed by an additional 165,000 square feet in the second stage. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed in Fall 2021. The Company has funded $15.8 million of the total $31.5 million incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2018.
In connection with the anticipated closures and lease rejections of several Sears stores owned or partially owned by the Company, the Company anticipates spending between $250.0 million to $300.0 million at the Company’s pro rata share to redevelop the  Sears stores. The anticipated openings of such redevelopments are expected to occur between 2020 and 2024. The estimated range of redevelopment costs could increase if the Company or its joint venture decide to expand the scope of the redevelopments.
Other Transactions and Events:
On October 30, 2015, the Company declared a special dividend/distribution ("Special Dividend") of $2.00 per share of common stock and per OP Unit that was paid on January 6, 2016 to common stockholders and OP Unit holders of record on November 12, 2015. The Special Dividend was funded from proceeds in connection with the financing and sale of ownership interests in Pacific Premier Retail LLC in 2015 and Arrowhead Towne Center in 2016 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity").

On February 17, 2016, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program ("ASR") to repurchase $400.0 million of the Company's common stock. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of $400.0 million and received an initial share delivery of 4,222,193 shares. On April 19, 2016, the ASR was completed and the Company received delivery of an additional 861,235 shares. The average price of the 5,083,428 shares repurchased under the ASR was $78.69 per share. The ASR was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, which had been paid down from the proceeds from the recently completed Joint Venture Transactions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity").
On May 9, 2016, the Company entered into an ASR to repurchase the remaining $400.0 million of the Company's common stock authorized for repurchase. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of $400.0 million and received an initial share delivery of 3,964,812 shares. On July 11, 2016, the ASR was completed and the Company received delivery of an additional 1,104,162 shares. The average price of the 5,068,974 shares repurchased under the ASR was $78.91 per share. The ASR was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, which had been recently paid down from the proceeds from the recently completed Joint Venture Transactions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity").
On July 15, 2016, the Company conveyed Flagstaff Mall, a 347,000 square foot regional shopping center in Flagstaff, Arizona, to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and was discharged from the mortgage note payable. The mortgage note payable was a non-recourse loan. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of $5.3 million on the extinguishment of debt.
On February 12, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common shares as market conditions and the Company’s liquidity warrant (the "2017 Stock Buyback Program"). Repurchases may be made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, structured or derivative transactions, including ASR transactions, or other methods of acquiring shares, from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. During the period from February 12, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 3,627,390 of its common shares for $221.4 million, representing an average price of $61.01 per share. The Company funded the repurchases from the net proceeds of the sale of Cascade Mall and Northgate Mall (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions"), its share of the proceeds from the sale of ownership interests in office buildings at Fashion District Philadelphia and Country Club Plaza (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions") and from borrowings under its line of credit.
On January 1, 2018, upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, "Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606)", the Company changed its accounting for Chandler Freehold from a co-venture arrangement to the Financing Arrangement. As a result, the Company no longer records co-venture expense for its partner's share of the income of Chandler Freehold. Under the Financing Arrangement, the Company recognizes interest expense on (i) the changes in fair value of the Financing Arrangement obligation, (ii) any payments to the joint venture partner equal to their pro rata share of net income and (iii) any payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income.
On February 1 and 2, 2018, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 10 percent. The Company incurred a one-time charge of $12.7 million in connection with the workforce reduction during the year ended December 31, 2018.  As a result of the workforce reduction, the Company, exclusive of the one-time charge, reduced expenses by approximately $10.0 million during the year ending December 31, 2018.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred $19.4 million in costs associated with activities related to shareholder activism. These costs were primarily for legal and advisory services.
Inflation:
In the last five years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically throughout the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, approximately 5% to 12% of the leases for spaces 10,000 square feet and under expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. The Company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center, which places the burden of cost control on the Company. Additionally, certain leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses.

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, capitalization of costs and fair value measurements. The Company's significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical.
Acquisitions:
The Company allocates the estimated fair value of acquisitions to land, building, tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. In addition, any assumed mortgage notes payable are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of the land and buildings is determined utilizing an “as if vacant” methodology. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with “cost avoidance” of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the “assumed vacant” property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below-market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus any below-market fixed rate renewal options. Above or below-market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below-market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases. The remaining lease terms of below-market leases may include certain below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. In considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below-market fixed-rate lease renewal option, the Company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the Center, the Company's relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space. The initial allocation of purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may change when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which does not exceed one year. The purchase price allocation is described as preliminary if it is not yet final. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenues and expenses.
The Company immediately expenses costs associated with business combinations as period costs and capitalizes costs associated with asset acquisitions.
Remeasurement gains are recognized when the Company obtains control of an existing equity method investment to the extent that the fair value of the existing equity investment exceeds the carrying value of the investment.
Asset Impairment:
The Company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include projected rental revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as well as estimated holding periods and capitalization rates. If an impairment indicator exists, the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis or a contracted sales price, with the carrying value of the related assets. The Company generally holds and operates its properties long-term, which decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable. Properties classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

46

The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically, and as deemed necessary, for recoverability and valuation declines that are other-than-temporary.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions.
Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made.
The Company records its Financing Arrangement obligation at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value being recorded as interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow model, with the significant unobservable inputs including the multiple of net operating income, discount rate, and market rents. The fair value of the Financing Arrangement obligation is sensitive to these significant unobservable inputs and a change in these inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement.

Results of Operations
Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred because of the transactions affecting the Company's properties described above, including those related to the Redevelopment Properties, the JV Transition Centers and the Disposition Properties (each as defined below).
For purposes of the discussion below, the Company defines "Same Centers" as those Centers that are substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Non-Same Centers for comparison purposes include those Centers or properties that are going through a substantial redevelopment often resulting in the closing of a portion of the Center (“Redevelopment Properties”), those properties that have recently transitioned to or from equity method joint ventures to consolidated assets ("JV Transition Centers") and properties that have been disposed of ("Disposition Properties"). The Company moves a Center in and out of Same Centers based on whether the Center is substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Accordingly, the Same Centers consist of all consolidated Centers, excluding the Redevelopment Properties, the JV Transition Centers and the Disposition Properties for the periods of comparison.
For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017, the Redevelopment Properties are Paradise Valley Mall and certain ground up developments. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016, the Redevelopment Properties are the expansion portion of Green Acres Mall, Paradise Valley Mall and One Westside.
For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017, the JV Transition Center is One Westside. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016, the JV Transition Centers are Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio. The change in revenues and expenses at the JV Transition Center for the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the conversion of One Westside from a Consolidated Center to an Unconsolidated Joint Venture Center. The change in revenues and expenses at the JV Transition Centers for the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the conversion of Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from Consolidated Centers to Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers.

47

For comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017, the Disposition Properties are Promenade at Casa Grande, 500 North Michigan Avenue, Cascade Mall and Northgate Mall. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016, the Disposition Properties are 500 North Michigan Avenue, Cascade Mall, Northgate Mall, Flagstaff Mall and Capitola Mall.
Unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures.
The Company considers tenant annual sales per square foot (for tenants in place for a minimum of 12 months or longer and 10,000 square feet and under) for regional shopping centers, occupancy rates (excluding large retail stores or "Anchors") for the Centers and releasing spreads (i.e. a comparison of initial average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the trailing twelve months to average base rent per square foot at expiration for the leases expiring during the year based on the spaces 10,000 square feet and under) to be key performance indicators of the Company's internal growth.
Tenant sales per square foot increased from $660 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 to $726 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. Occupancy rate increased from 95.0% at December 31, 2017 to 95.4% at December 31, 2018. Releasing spreads remained positive as the Company was able to lease available space at average higher rents than the expiring rental rates, resulting in a releasing spread of $5.75 per square foot ($57.55 on new and renewal leases executed compared to $51.80 on leases expiring), representing a 11.1% increase for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The Company expects that releasing spreads will continue to be positive for 2019 as it renews or relets leases that are scheduled to expire. These leases that are scheduled to expire represent approximately 900,000 square feet of the Centers, accounting for 12.5% of the GLA of mall stores and freestanding stores, for spaces 10,000 square feet and under, as of December 31, 2018. These calculations exclude Centers under development or redevelopment and property dispositions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Redevelopment and Development Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary).
During the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company signed 241 new leases and 363 renewal leases comprising approximately 1.0 million square feet of GLA, of which 0.7 million square feet related to the consolidated Centers. The annual initial average base rent for new and renewal leases was $57.55 per square foot for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2018 with an average tenant allowance of $28.74 per square foot.
Outlook
The Company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of Regional Shopping Centers. Although the Company believes that overall regional shopping centers fundamentals in its markets appear reasonably strong heading into 2019, the Company expects that its results for 2019 will be negatively impacted by rising interest rates and anticipated Anchor closures and tenant bankruptcies, among other factors.
Rising interest rates increase the cost of the Company’s borrowings due to its outstanding floating-rate debt and lead to higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. In certain cases, the Company may limit its exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of its floating-rate debt by using interest rate cap and swap agreements. Such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow the Company to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve its desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. However, in an increasing interest rate environment the fixed rates the Company can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new debt will also continue to increase.
In recent years, a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of the Company’s Anchors, have declared bankruptcy, have gone out of business or have significantly reduced the number of their retail stores. Store closures by an Anchor may impact the Company’s Centers more holistically by causing other Anchors and/or certain other tenants to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent and/or cease operating their stores at the Center.
On October 15, 2018, Sears filed for bankruptcy and announced additional store closings. As of December 31, 2018, following the closure of four stores during 2018, the Company had 17 Sears stores totaling approximately 2.6 million square feet of gross leasable area within the Company’s portfolio and accounting for approximately 1% of the Company’s total minimum and percentage rents. In January 2019, Sears closed nine additional stores. The remaining eight stores include three owned by the Company, three owned by the Company’s joint venture with Seritage Growth Properties (“Seritage”) and two owned by a third-party. Due to its bankruptcy filing, Sears may be unable or unwilling to meet its rent obligations and other obligations under its leases with the Company, and the Company may be unable to re-lease a terminated or rejected space on comparable terms or at all.

48

Although, in the short-term, the bankruptcy of an Anchor such as Sears may lead to lost base rent and the triggering of co-tenancy clauses, there is also the potential to create additional future value through the recapturing of space and releasing that space to new tenants at higher rent per square foot, which the Company has demonstrated through its joint venture with Seritage and the completed redevelopment of a former Sears store at Kings Plaza Shopping Center in July 2018.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017
Revenues:
Minimum and percentage rents (collectively referred to as "rental revenue") decreased by $17.7 million, or 2.9%, from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in rental revenue is attributed to a decrease of $10.4 million from the Disposition Properties and $9.6 million from the JV Transition Center offset in part by an increase of $1.6 million from the Same Centers and $0.7 million from the Redevelopment Properties.
Rental revenue includes the amortization of above and below-market leases, the amortization of straight-line rents and lease termination income. The amortization of above and below-market leases increased from $1.0 million in 2017 to $1.9 million in 2018. The amortization of straight-line rents increased from $8.6 million in 2017 to $11.8 million in 2018. Lease termination income decreased from $18.1 million in 2017 to $9.9 million in 2018.
Tenant recoveries decreased $19.8 million, or 7.0%, from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in tenant recoveries is attributed to a decrease of $15.3 million from the Same Centers, $3.1 million from the JV Transition Center and $1.4 million from the Disposition Properties. The decrease in tenant recoveries at the the Same Centers is primarily due to a reduction in property tax expense.
Management Companies' revenue increased from $43.4 million in 2017 to $43.5 million in 2018.
 Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:
Shopping center and operating expenses decreased $17.7 million, or 6.0%, from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses is attributed to a decrease of $9.8 million from the Same Centers, $5.5 million from the Disposition Properties and $5.0 million from the JV Transition Center offset in part by an increase of $2.6 million from the Redevelopment Properties. The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses at the the Same Centers is primarily due to a reduction in property tax expense.
Management Companies' Operating Expenses:
Management Companies' operating expenses increased $3.4 million from 2017 to 2018. The increase is attributed to a one-time charge of $12.7 million in connection with the Company's reduction in work force in 2018 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by a reduction in payroll and share and unit-based compensation costs.
REIT General and Administrative Expenses:
REIT general and administrative expenses decreased $4.1 million from 2017 to 2018 due to a reduction in compensation costs.
Costs Related to Shareholder Activism:
The Company incurred $19.4 million in costs related to shareholder activism in 2018 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Depreciation and Amortization:
Depreciation and amortization decreased $8.0 million from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to a decrease of $4.9 million from the JV Transition Center, $4.3 million from the Disposition Properties and $0.3 million from the Redevelopment Properties offset in part by an increase of $1.5 million from the Same Centers.

49

Interest Expense:
Interest expense increased $11.2 million from 2017 to 2018. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributed to an increase of $10.6 million from the Same Centers, $4.0 million from borrowings under the line of credit, $0.8 million from the Redevelopment Properties, $0.3 million from the Disposition Properties and $0.2 million from the Financing Arrangement (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by a decrease of $4.7 million from the JV Transition Center. The increase in interest expense at the Same Centers is primarily due to the new loans on Green Acres Commons and Freehold Raceway Mall (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary).
The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which increased from $13.2 million in 2017 to $15.4 million in 2018.
Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:
Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $13.8 million from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in equity in income from joint ventures is primarily due to the gain on the sale of an ownership interest in office buildings at Fashion District Philadelphia in 2017 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and interest expense on the new the mortgage loan on Broadway Plaza in 2018 (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary).
(Loss) Gain on Sale or Write Down of Assets, net:
The change in (loss) gain on sale or write down of assets, net was $74.3 million, resulting from a gain of $42.4 million in 2017 and a loss of $31.8 million in 2018. The change in (loss) gain on sale or write down of assets, net is primarily due to the gain of $59.6 million on the sale of Cascade Mall and Northgate Mall in 2017 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and impairment losses of $54.5 million on SouthPark Mall, La Cumbre Plaza, Southridge Center and Promenade at Casa Grande in 2018 offset in part by the gain of $46.2 million on the sale of a 75% ownership interest in One Westside in 2018 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and impairment losses of $22.1 million on Southridge Center and Promenade at Casa Grande in 2017. The impairment losses were due to the reduction in the estimated holding periods of the properties.
Net Income:
Net income decreased $92.7 million from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in net income is primarily attributed to the change in (loss) gain on sale or write down of assets, net of $74.3 million, as discussed above.
Funds From Operations ("FFO"):
Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders—diluted decreased 3.2% from $582.9 million in 2017 to $564.4 million 2018. For a reconciliation of net income attributable to the Company, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders and FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders—diluted, see "Funds From Operations ("FFO")" below.
Operating Activities:
Cash provided by operating activities decreased $42.1 million from 2017 to 2018. The decrease is primarily due to the $19.4 million in costs related to shareholder activism in 2018 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary), changes in assets and liabilities and the results as discussed above.
Investing Activities:
Cash provided by investing activities decreased $2.7 million from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributed to a decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of assets of $169.4 million, an increase in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures of $63.7 million, an increase in development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of properties costs of $20.7 million and an increase in property improvements of $14.3 million offset in part by an increase in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $268.7 million.
The decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of assets is attributed to the sales of Cascade Mall and Northgate Mall in 2017 offset in part by the proceeds from the sale of Promenade at Casa Grande and an ownership interest in Westside Pavilion in 2018 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). The increase in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the distribution of the Company's share of proceeds from the loans placed on Broadway Plaza and Fashion District Philadelphia (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary) and the sale of The Market at Estrella Falls and the sale of an ownership interest in an office building at Fashion District Philadelphia (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) in 2018.

50

Financing Activities:
Cash used in financing activities decreased $51.8 million from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a decrease in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $749.9 million, the repurchases of the Company's common stock of $221.4 million in 2017 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) and a decrease in distributions to co-venture partner of $103.8 million (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by a decrease in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $1.0 billion.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016
Revenues:
Minimum and percentage rents decreased by $26.0 million, or 4.1%, from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in rental revenue is attributed to a decrease of $18.3 million from the Disposition Properties, $17.7 million from the Redevelopment Properties and $3.3 million from the Joint Venture Centers offset in part by an increase of $13.3 million from the Same Centers. The increase in rental revenue at the Same Centers is primarily due to an increase in lease termination income and an increase in leasing spreads.
The amortization of above and below-market leases decreased from $12.8 million in 2016 to $1.0 million in 2017 primarily due to the JV Transition Centers. The amortization of straight-line rents increased from $5.2 million in 2016 to $8.6 million in 2017. Lease termination income decreased from $19.2 million in 2016 to $18.1 million in 2017.
Tenant recoveries decreased $22.0 million, or 7.2%, from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in tenant recoveries is attributed to a decrease of $9.3 million from the Same Centers, $8.3 million from the Disposition Properties, $2.8 million from the Redevelopment Properties and $1.6 million from the Joint Venture Centers. The decrease in tenant recoveries from the Same Centers is primarily due to a decrease in property tax expense and utility cost.
Management Companies' revenue increased from $39.5 million in 2016 to $43.4 million in 2017. The increase in Management Companies' revenue is due to an increase in development and leasing fees from joint ventures.
Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:
Shopping center and operating expenses decreased $12.4 million, or 4.0%, from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses is attributed to a decrease of $11.5 million from the Disposition Properties, $1.3 million from the Redevelopment Properties and $0.8 million from the Joint Venture Centers offset in part by an increase of $1.2 million from the Same Centers.
Management Companies' Operating Expenses:
Management Companies' operating expenses increased $1.8 million from 2016 to 2017.
REIT General and Administrative Expenses:
REIT general and administrative expenses were $28.2 million in 2016 and 2017.
Depreciation and Amortization:
Depreciation and amortization decreased $13.1 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to a decrease of $10.5 million from the Disposition Properties, $4.4 million from the Same Centers and $1.5 million from the Joint Venture Centers offset in part by an increase of $3.3 million from the Redevelopment Properties.
Interest Expense:
Interest expense increased $8.1 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributed to an increase of $6.8 million from borrowings under the line of credit, $5.4 million from the Same Centers and $0.2 million from the Redevelopment Properties offset in part by a decrease of $3.4 million from the Disposition Properties and $0.9 million from the Joint Venture Centers. The increase in interest expense at the Same Centers is primarily due to a new loan on Fresno Fashion Fair in 2016 (See "Financing Activity" in Management's Overview and Summary).
The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which increased from $10.3 million in 2016 to $13.2 million in 2017.

51

Gain on Extinguishment of Debt, net:
The gain on extinguishment of debt, net of $1.7 million in 2016 was due to the gain of $5.3 million on the settlement of the mortgage note payable on Flagstaff Mall by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in 2016 (See “Other Transactions and Events” in Management’s Overview and Summary) offset in part by a loss of $3.6 million on the early extinguishment of debt on Arrowhead Towne Center in 2016 (See “Financing Activities” in Management’s Overview and Summary).
Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:
Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $28.6 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase is primarily due to the conversion of Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from Consolidated Centers to Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers in 2016 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), the Company's share of the gain on the sales of ownership interests in office buildings at Fashion District Philadelphia and Country Club Plaza in 2017 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and the Company's shares of the gain on land sales at other joint ventures in 2017.
Gain on Sale or Write down of Assets, net:
Gain on sale or write down of assets, net decreased $372.9 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the gain of $467.2 million on the sales of ownership interests in Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio in 2016 and the sale of Capitola Mall in 2016 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by the gain of $74.2 million on the sales of Cascade Mall, Northgate Mall and 500 North Michigan Avenue in 2017 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Net Income:
Net income decreased $393.2 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in net income is primarily attributed to a decrease of $372.9 million from gain on sale or write down of assets, net, as discussed above.
Funds From Operations:
Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders—diluted decreased 9.3% from $642.3 million in 2016 to $582.9 million in 2017. For a reconciliation of net income attributable to the Company, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders and FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders—diluted, see "Funds From Operations ("FFO")" below.
Operating Activities:
Cash provided by operating activities decreased from $429.5 million in 2016 to $386.4 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities and the results as discussed above.
Investing Activities:
Cash provided by investing activities decreased $275.1 million from 2016 to 2017.  The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets of $469.0 million and a decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $176.1 million offset in part by a decrease in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures of $312.9 million and a decrease in development, redevelopment and renovations of $51.3 million.
The decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of assets is attributed to the sales of ownership interests in Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio in 2016 and the sale of Capitola Mall in 2016 offset in part by the sale of Cascade Mall, Northgate Mall and 500 North Michigan Avenue in 2017 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). The decrease in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in Country Club Plaza in 2016 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Financing Activities:
Cash used in financing activities decreased $301.2 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a decrease in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $1.2 billion, a decrease in the repurchases of the Company's common stock of $578.6 million (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) and a decrease in cash dividends and distributions of $335.5 million offset in part by a decrease in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $1.8 billion and an increase in distributions to co-venture partner of $85.6 million.

52

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses and debt service and dividend requirements for the next twelve months through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its unsecured line of credit.
The following tables summarize capital expenditures and lease acquisition costs incurred at the Centers (at the Company's pro rata share) for the years ended December 31:

--------------------------------------------------------------- ------- ------- ---- ------- ---- ------- ------- - -------

(Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2016
Consolidated Centers:
Acquisitions of property and equipment $ 53,350 $ 38,153 $ 56,759
Development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of Centers 173,329 152,095 183,220
Tenant allowances 12,636 11,484 19,229
Deferred leasing charges 17,353 26,526 24,845
 $ 256,668 $ 228,258 $ 284,053
Joint Venture Centers (at Company's pro rata share):
Acquisitions of property and equipment $ 15,697 $ 16,069 $ 349,819
Development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of Centers 145,905 121,787 101,124
Tenant allowances 8,736 6,779 11,271
Deferred leasing charges 10,880 6,154 7,070
 $ 181,218 $ 150,789 $ 469,284

The Company expects amounts to be incurred during the next twelve months for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable or less than 2018 and that capital for those expenditures will be available from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings on property specific debt or unsecured corporate borrowings. Although the amounts incurred for deferred leasing charges during the next twelve months are expected to be comparable or less than 2018, the Company will begin expensing a significant portion of its leasing costs in 2019 in accordance with its adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 842 ,"Leases". The Company expects to incur between $250 million and $350 million during the next twelve months for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these major expenditures, developments and/or redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from a combination of debt or equity financings, which are expected to include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans.
The Company has also generated liquidity in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, through equity offerings and issuances, property refinancings, joint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets. For example, the Company's recently completed sales of ownership interests in Westside Pavilion and ownership interests in office buildings at Fashion District Philadelphia and Country Club Plaza (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), the sales of The Market at Estrella Falls, Promenade at Casa Grande, Cascade Mall, Northgate Mall and 500 North Michigan Avenue and the financing of Fashion District Philadelphia and Broadway Plaza (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary). The Company used the proceeds from these transactions to pay down its line of credit and for other general corporate purposes, which included the repurchases of the Company's common stock under the 2017 Stock Buyback Program (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary). Furthermore, the Company has filed a shelf registration statement, which registered an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights, stock purchase contracts and units that may be sold from time to time by the Company. The Company expects any additional repurchases of the Company's common stock under the 2017 Stock Buyback Program to be funded by future sales of non-core assets, borrowings under its line of credit and/or refinancing transactions.
The capital and credit markets can fluctuate and, at times, limit access to debt and equity financing for companies. As demonstrated by the Company's recent activity as discussed below, the Company has been able to access capital; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. In the event that the Company has significant tenant defaults as a result of the overall economy and general market conditions, the Company could have a decrease in cash flow from operations, which could result in increased borrowings under its line of credit. These events could result in an increase in the Company's proportion of floating rate debt, which would cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future.

53

The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness, which includes mortgages and other notes payable, at December 31, 2018 was $7.9 billion (consisting of $5.0 billion of consolidated debt, less $318.7 million of noncontrolling interests, plus $3.2 billion of its pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgage notes collateralized by individual properties. The Company expects that all of the maturities during the next twelve months will be refinanced, restructured, extended and/or paid off from the Company's line of credit or cash on hand.
The Company believes that the pro rata debt provides useful information to investors regarding its financial condition because it includes the Company’s share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and, for consolidated debt, excludes the Company’s partners’ share from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. The Company has several significant joint ventures and presenting its pro rata share of debt in this manner can help investors better understand the Company’s financial condition after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures. The Company’s pro rata share of debt should not be considered as a substitute for the Company’s total consolidated debt determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit facility that bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 1.30% to 1.90%, depending on the Company's overall leverage level, and matures on July 6, 2020 with a one-year extension option. The line of credit can be expanded, depending on certain conditions, up to a total facility of $2.0 billion. All obligations under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed only by the Company. Based on the Company's leverage level as of December 31, 2018, the borrowing rate on the facility was LIBOR plus 1.45%. The Company has four interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a total of $400.0 million of the outstanding balance from floating rate debt of LIBOR plus 1.45% to fixed rate debt of 4.30% until September 30, 2021. At December 31, 2018, total borrowings under the line of credit were $910.0 million less unamortized deferred finance costs of $5.1 million with a total interest rate of 4.20%. The Company's availability under the line of credit was $589.7 million at December 31, 2018.
Cash dividends and distributions for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $453.6 million. A total of $344.3 million was funded by operations. The remaining $109.3 million was funded from distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, which were included in the cash flows from investing activities section of the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants under its agreements.
At December 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $102.7 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:
The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, the Company is contingently liable for $65.8 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relating to the Centers. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company.

Funds From Operations ("FFO")
The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO -diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("Nareit") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. As a result of changes in the accounting standard ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018, the Company began treating its joint venture in Chandler Freehold as a Financing Arrangement for accounting purposes. In connection with this treatment, the Company recognizes financing expense on (i) the changes in fair value of the financing arrangement obligation, (ii) any payments to the joint venture partner equal to their pro rata share of net income and (iii) any payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. The Company excludes from its definition of FFO the noted expense related to the changes in fair value and for the payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. Although the Nareit definition of FFO predates this guidance for accounting for financing arrangements, the Company believes that excluding the noted expense resulting from the Financing Arrangement is consistent with the key objective of FFO as a performance measure and it allows the Company’s current FFO to be comparable with the Company’s FFO from prior quarters. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company also presents FFO excluding extinguishment of debt, net and costs related to shareholder activism and unsolicited takeover offer.
FFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. In addition, the Company believes that FFO excluding non-routine costs associated with shareholder activism provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance as it shows a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company’s operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company’s results. The Company further believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities.
The Company believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts.
Management compensates for the limitations of FFO by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and a reconciliation of net income to FFO and FFO-diluted. Management believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be compared with the Company's reported net

income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements.
The following reconciles net income attributable to the Company to FFO and FFO-diluted for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars and shares in thousands):
