In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"), the term "Celanese" refers to Celanese Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and not its subsidiaries. The terms the "Company," "we," "our" and "us," refer to Celanese and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The term "Celanese US" refers to the Company's subsidiary, Celanese US Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and not its subsidiaries.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP").
Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements contained in this section and other parts of this Annual Report involve both risk and uncertainty. Several important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by these statements. Many of these statements are macroeconomic in nature and are, therefore, beyond the control of management. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
Forward-Looking Statements
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") and other parts of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking statements and information relating to us that are based on the beliefs of our management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. Generally, words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "may," "can," "could," "might," and "will," and similar expressions, as they relate to us are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views and beliefs with respect to future events at the time that the statements are made, are not historical facts or guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Further, certain forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the beginning of this Annual Report for further discussion.

Consolidated Results
Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017
Net sales increased $1.0 billion, or 16.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher pricing in our Acetyl Chain and Engineered Materials segments; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher volume in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily related to our base business driven by new project launches and pipeline growth, and Net sales generated from acquisitions. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $50 million, or 10.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in functional spending and incentive compensation costs of $42 million in Other Activities.

Operating profit increased $477 million, or 55.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher Net sales in our Acetyl Chain and Engineered Materials segments; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a favorable impact of $63 million to Other (charges) gains, net in our Acetyl Chain segment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided notice of termination of a contract with a key raw materials supplier at our ethanol production unit in Nanjing, China. As a result, we recorded a $22 million contract termination charge and a $21 million reduction to our non-income tax receivable, which did not recur in the current year. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we received a $13 million non-income tax receivable refund from Nanjing, China. See Note 18 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information;

partially offset by:

- -----------------------------------------------------
• higher raw material costs across all of our segments;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher spending of $72 million and $34 million in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments, respectively; and

- -----------------------------
• an increase in SG&A expenses.

Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates increased $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in equity investment in earnings of $38 million from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate primarily as a result of an increase in our indirect economic ownership from 25% to 32.5% due to the startup of its polyoxymethylene ("POM") production facility in Saudi Arabia during the three months ended December 31, 2017.

Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expense increased $106 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in recognized actuarial loss of $119 million as a result of lower asset returns, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations from 3.3% to 3.8%.

Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 19% compared to 20% for the year ended 2017. The effective tax rate for 2018 was slightly less than the statutory US tax rate primarily due to the positive impact from our jurisdictional mix of earnings, largely offset by increased valuation allowances established on certain deferred tax assets, particularly related to increases in provisionally recorded estimates of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits in the US and net operating loss carryforwards in Luxembourg, due to certain restructuring transactions completed to facilitate future repatriation of cash to the US.
On December 31, 2017, the TCJA was enacted and was effective January 1, 2018. Due to the timing and significance of the TCJA, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provided registrants a measurement period through 2018 to report the impact of the new US tax law.
In 2017, we previously recorded provisional amounts for several of the impacts of the new tax law including: the deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits, the deferred tax rate change effect of the new law, gross foreign tax credit carryforwards and related valuation allowances to offset foreign tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the TCJA, including the proposed 2018 clarifying guidance. See Note 19 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
Net sales increased $751 million, or 13.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher volume in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily related to Net sales generated from SO.F.TER. S.r.l. ("SOFTER") and from the nylon compounding division of Nilit Group ("Nilit"), as well as within our base business, which was driven by new project launches and pipeline growth globally; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher pricing for most of our products in our Acetyl Chain segment;

partially offset by:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower acetate tow pricing and volume in our Acetate Tow segment; and

- -----------------------------------------------------
• lower volume for ethanol in our Acetyl Chain segment.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $118 million, or 31.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in spending of approximately $100 million in our Engineered Materials segment and Other Activities primarily related to ongoing merger, acquisition and integration related costs.

Operating profit decreased $77 million, or 8.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
• higher raw material costs, primarily in our Acetyl Chain segment;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher plant spending of $138 million in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily related to our acquisitions of SOFTER and Nilit, as these acquired businesses incurred ongoing plant spending;

- ---------------------------------
• an increase in SG&A expenses; and

 37

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an unfavorable impact of $47 million to Other (charges) gains, net in our Acetyl Chain segment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we provided notice of termination of a contract with a key raw materials supplier at our ethanol production unit in Nanjing, China. As a result, we recorded a $22 million contract termination charge and a $21 million reduction to our non-income tax receivable. See Note 18 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information;

partially offset by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher Net sales in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• cost savings in our Acetyl Chain and Acetate Tow segments, primarily due to productivity initiatives.

Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates increased $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates of $20 million from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate as a result of higher pricing and timing of turnaround activity.

Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit income increased $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in recognized actuarial loss of $57 million as a result of higher asset returns, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations from 3.7% to 3.3%.

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 20% compared to 12% for the year ended 2016. The 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. We recognized net tax expense of $197 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings accumulated offshore since 1986. This expense of $197 million was partially offset by a $107 million reduction of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of lowering the US tax rate from 35% to 21% and other technical provisions in the TCJA. We also recognized a net tax benefit of $76 million related to foreign tax credits generated as a result of various reorganization transactions to separate certain Acetate Tow assets to reorganize the holdings of its various foreign subsidiaries. No material cash impact is expected from the deemed repatriation due to existing foreign tax credit carryforwards. The 2016 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted primarily due to settlement of uncertain tax positions and technical clarifications in Germany and the US of $55 million. See Note 19 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower acetate tow pricing due to lower global industry utilization.

Operating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to:

- ----------------
• lower Net sales;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher depreciation and amortization expense of $17 million, primarily due to the closure of our acetate tow manufacturing unit in Ocotlán, Mexico in 2018. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• higher raw material costs, primarily related to acetic acid.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
Net sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower acetate tow volume and pricing due to lower global industry utilization.

Operating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- ----------------
• lower Net sales;

partially offset by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower spending and raw material costs of $37 million primarily related to productivity initiatives.

In June 2017, Celanese, through various subsidiaries, entered into an agreement with affiliates of the Blackstone Group L.P. (the "Blackstone Entities") to form a joint venture which combines substantially all of the operations of our Acetate Tow business and the operations of the Rhodia Acetow cellulose acetate business formerly operated by Solvay S.A. and acquired by the Blackstone Entities in June 2017. The parties were subsequently unable to reach an agreement with the European Commission on acceptable conditions to allow the proposed joint venture to proceed. The demands by the European Commission eliminated the primary advantages of the transaction. As a result, on March 19, 2018, we and the Blackstone Entities abandoned our agreement to form the proposed joint venture.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017
Net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher pricing due to higher industry utilization rates, which positively impacted pricing for most of our products;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a favorable currency impact resulting from a strong Euro relative to the US dollar; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments. In addition, as of December 31, 2018 we have $960 million available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and $14 million available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations.
While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements, including debt service, for the next twelve months. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels.
Total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million in 2019 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments.
On a stand-alone basis, Celanese and its immediate 100% owned subsidiary, Celanese US, have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own. Accordingly, they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to Celanese and Celanese US in order to meet their obligations, including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock").
We are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate, such as China, India, and Indonesia. Capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies, repatriate earnings or capital, lend via intercompany loans or create cross-border cash pooling arrangements. Our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in China. Pursuant to applicable regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the Chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of China, puts certain limitations on duration, purpose and amount of intercompany loans, and restricts cross-border cash pooling.
Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents decreased $137 million to $439 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, $368 million of the $439 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Under the TCJA, we have incurred a charge associated with the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings, including foreign held cash. These funds are largely accessible, if needed in the US to fund operations. See Note 19 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

• an increase of $305 million in share repurchases of our Common Stock during the year ended December 31, 2018;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in net proceeds from long-term debt of $249 million, primarily as a result of the repayment of our senior unsecured term loan during the year ended December 31, 2018 with proceeds from the issuance of €500 million in principal amount of 2.125% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2027 ("2.125% Notes"), as discussed below;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in net borrowings on short-term debt of $234 million, primarily as a result of higher net borrowings under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility during the year ended December 31, 2017 in connection with the acquisition of Nilit, which did not recur in the current year; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

partially offset by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in net proceeds from long-term debt of $108 million, primarily due to the refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities during the year ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by the senior unsecured debt issuance during the year ended December 31, 2017, as discussed below; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in Common Stock cash dividends of $40 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased our Common Stock quarterly cash dividend rate from $0.36 to $0.46 per share.

Debt and Other Obligations

- ------------------------
• Senior Credit Facilities

In July 2016, Celanese, Celanese US and certain subsidiaries entered into a new senior credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") consisting of a $500 million senior unsecured term loan and a $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit), each maturing in 2021. The margin for borrowings under the senior unsecured term loan and the senior unsecured revolving credit facility was 1.5% above LIBOR at our current credit ratings. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese, Celanese US and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries ("the Subsidiary Guarantors"). The proceeds from the new senior unsecured term loan and $409 million of borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility were used to repay our Term C-2 and C-3 loans under our previous senior secured credit facilities. We borrowed $940 million and repaid $997 million under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 30 - Subsequent Events in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Table of Contents

The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Celanese US may redeem some or all of each of the Senior Notes, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus a "make-whole" premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.
On November 5, 2018, Celanese US completed an offering of the 2.125% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 2.125% Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The 2.125% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.231%. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2.125% Notes were used to repay $463 million of our senior unsecured term loan and for general corporate purposes.
In December 2017, Celanese US completed an offering of the 1.250% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 1.250% Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The 1.250% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.810%. Net proceeds from the sale of the 1.250% Notes were used to make a discretionary contribution into our US pension plans of $316 million and for general corporate purposes.
In September 2016, Celanese US completed an offering of the 1.125% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 1.125% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.713%. Net proceeds from the sale of the 1.125% Notes were used to repay $411 million of outstanding borrowings under the new senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.

- ----------------------------
• Other Financing Arrangements

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we entered into a factoring agreement with a global financial institution to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer. We have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized $117 million of accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2018.
In July 2016, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amendment of our accounts receivable securitization facility, extending its maturity to July 2019 and decreasing the available amount to $120 million. We borrowed $25 million and repaid $28 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Our material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, events of default and change of control provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. We are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of December 31, 2018.
See Note 14 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Share Capital
On September 17, 2018, we filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment (the "Certificate of Amendment") to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to remove all references to our Series B Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, therefrom and to redesignate our Series A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, as "Common Stock." Following the filing of the Certificate of Amendment, we no longer have series of our class of common stock.
On February 6, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.54 per share on our Common Stock amounting to $69 million. The cash dividend will be paid on March 1, 2019 to holders of record as of February 19, 2019.
Our Board of Directors has authorized the aggregate repurchase of $3.9 billion of our Common Stock since February 2008. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased shares of our Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $817 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had $713 million remaining under authorizations by our Board of Directors.
See Note 17 - Stockholders' Equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

(1) Future interest expense is calculated using the rate in effect on December 31, 2018.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Other debt is primarily made up of fixed rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds, short-term borrowings from affiliated companies, our revolving credit facility, our accounts receivable securitization facility and other bank obligations.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities, we are unable to determine the timing of payments related to our uncertain tax obligations, including interest and penalties. These amounts are therefore reflected in "After 5 Years".

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent the take-or-pay provisions included in certain long-term purchase agreements. We do not expect to incur material losses under these arrangements. These amounts, obtained via a survey of Celanese, also include other purchase obligations such as maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts, software agreements and other miscellaneous agreements and contracts.

Contractual Guarantees and Commitments
As of December 31, 2018, we have standby letters of credit of $29 million and bank guarantees of $9 million outstanding, which are irrevocable obligations of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements.
See Note 14 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the guarantees under our Senior Notes and Credit Agreement.
See Note 24 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results.
We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results. See Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

- -----------------------------------
• Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets
We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker. Our reporting units include our engineered materials, acetate tow, food ingredients, emulsion polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
When assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. After assessing qualitative factors, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative assessment is not required. If an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset, a quantitative analysis will be performed. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances.
In performing a quantitative analysis, recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. We may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process. The valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches (market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis) and the discounted cash flow approach. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"). The WACC considers market and industry data as well as company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain long-lived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing.
Management tests other indefinite-lived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. The relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant

management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the WACC considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. Royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates.
Valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods. We periodically engage third-party valuation consultants to assist us with this process. Specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and company-specific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant. The current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions. To the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections, impairment losses may occur in future periods.
See Note 11 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

• Environmental Liabilities

We manufacture and sell a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world. Accordingly, our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials. We recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the site, we accrue through 15 years, unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond 15 years. We estimate environmental liabilities on a case-by-case basis using the most current status of available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.
An environmental reserve related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation monitoring costs. These undiscounted reserves do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance. The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on our periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort. We utilize third parties to assist in the management and development of cost estimates for our sites. Changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur.
See Note 16 - Environmental in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

- -------------------
• Benefit Obligations

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These assumptions include the discount rate, compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs. In addition, actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods.
Pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured. Assumptions are reviewed on a plan and country-specific basis by third-party actuaries and senior management. Such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook.
Beginning in 2016, we elected to change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our significant defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. Previously, we estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of net periodic benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This change improves the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.

Table of Contents

This change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest cost will be completely offset in the annual actuarial (gain) loss reported. We accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it prospectively beginning in 2016.
See Note 15 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
The estimated change in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost that would occur in 2019 from a change in the indicated assumptions are as follows:

• Legal Proceedings

We routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to legal and regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims, and investigations, incidental to the normal conduct of our past and current business, as well as ranges of probable and reasonably estimable losses. Reasonable estimates involve judgments made by us after considering a broad range of information including: notifications, prior settlements, demands, which have been received from a regulatory authority or private party, estimates performed by independent consultants and outside counsel, available facts, identification of other potentially responsible parties and their ability to contribute, as well as prior experience. A determination of the amount of loss contingency required, if any, is recorded if probable and estimable after careful analysis of each individual matter. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and as additional information becomes available. Due to the inherent subjectivity of assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, our litigation accruals and estimates of possible loss or range of possible loss may not represent the ultimate loss to us from legal proceedings.
See Note 24 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

• Income Taxes

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed. In forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards, we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified. We attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature. Weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles. Less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature, and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide. Valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the US, Luxembourg, Spain, China, the United Kingdom, Canada and France. We have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.

Table of Contents

The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment. If actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or Other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. In addition, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties.

Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, data centers, land, and colocations with original lease periods expiring between 2019 and 2093. We are committed to pay a portion of the related actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. Certain of these arrangements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions, and we recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis. The following is a schedule, by years, of the future minimum lease payments required under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): ---------------------------- ---------------- ------ Operating Leases 2019 $ 698 2020 946 2021 1,055 2022 1,048 2023 1,054 Thereafter 9,850 Total minimum lease payments $ 14,651 Operating lease expense was $629 million, $363 million, and $269 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We fully repaid all our capital lease obligations during 2016. Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $6.17 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2018, primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Contingencies Lega...

Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expense increased $106 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in recognized actuarial loss of $119 million as a result of lower asset returns, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations from 3.3% to 3.8%.

Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 19% compared to 20% for the year ended 2017. The effective tax rate for 2018 was slightly less than the statutory US tax rate primarily due to the positive impact from our jurisdictional mix of earnings, largely offset by increased valuation allowances established on certain deferred tax assets, particularly related to increases in provisionally recorded estimates of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits in the US and net operating loss carryforwards in Luxembourg, due to certain restructuring transactions completed to facilitate future repatriation of cash to the US.
On December 31, 2017, the TCJA was enacted and was effective January 1, 2018. Due to the timing and significance of the TCJA, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provided registrants a measurement period through 2018 to report the impact of the new US tax law.
In 2017, we previously recorded provisional amounts for several of the impacts of the new tax law including: the deemed repatriation tax on post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits, the deferred tax rate change effect of the new law, gross foreign tax credit carryforwards and related valuation allowances to offset foreign tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the TCJA, including the proposed 2018 clarifying guidance. See Note 19 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
Net sales increased $751 million, or 13.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
Net sales increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher volume primarily due to Net sales generated from SOFTER and from Nilit, and within our base business driven by new project launches and pipeline growth globally;

slightly offset by:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower pricing for most of our products due to customer and regional mix.

Operating profit increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- -----------------
• higher Net sales;

partially offset by:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher plant spending of $138 million, primarily related to our acquisitions of SOFTER and Nilit, as these acquired businesses incur ongoing plant spending;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher energy and raw material costs, primarily related to methanol; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher depreciation and amortization expense, primarily related to our acquisitions of SOFTER and Nilit.

Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in equity investment in earnings of $20 million from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate as a result of higher pricing and timing of turnaround activity;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in equity investment in earnings of $11 million from our InfraServ GmbH & Co. Hoechst KG affiliate as a result of an ownership change between our Engineered Materials and Other Activities segments. See Note 9 - Investment in Affiliates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information; and

(4) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent the take-or-pay provisions included in certain long-term purchase agreements. We do not expect to incur material losses under these arrangements. These amounts, obtained via a survey of Celanese, also include other purchase obligations such as maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts, software agreements and other miscellaneous agreements and contracts.

Contractual Guarantees and Commitments
As of December 31, 2018, we have standby letters of credit of $29 million and bank guarantees of $9 million outstanding, which are irrevocable obligations of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements.
See Note 14 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the guarantees under our Senior Notes and Credit Agreement.
See Note 24 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any material off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results.
We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results. See Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

• Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets
We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker. Our reporting units include our engineered materials, acetate tow, food ingredients, emulsion polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
When assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. After assessing qualitative factors, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative assessment is not required. If an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset, a quantitative analysis will be performed. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances.
In performing a quantitative analysis, recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. We may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process. The valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches (market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis) and the discounted cash flow approach. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital ("]:

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies.

[" Following the filing of the Certificate of Amendment, we no longer have series of our class of common stock.
On February 6, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.54 per share on our Common Stock amounting to $69 million. The cash dividend will be paid on March 1, 2019 to holders of record as of February 19, 2019.
Our Board of Directors has authorized the aggregate repurchase of $3.9 billion of our Common Stock since February 2008. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased shares of our Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $817 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had $713 million remaining under authorizations by our Board of Directors.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization.

The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performan...
