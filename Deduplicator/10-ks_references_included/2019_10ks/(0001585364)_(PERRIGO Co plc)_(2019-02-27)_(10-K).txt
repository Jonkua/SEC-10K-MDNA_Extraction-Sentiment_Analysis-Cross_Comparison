Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Executive Overview

We have grown rapidly in recent years through a combination of organic and inorganic growth. We continually reinvest in our R&D pipeline and work with partners as necessary to strive to be first-to-market with new products. Our organic growth has been and will continue to be driven by successful new product launches in all our segments. Over time, we expect to continue to grow inorganically through expansion into adjacent products, product categories, and channels, as well as potentially through entry into new geographic markets. We evaluate potential acquisition targets using a return on invested capital metric.

Vision Transformation

Upon the arrival of our new CEO and President Murray Kessler, he and his leadership team made their first priority to set a new vision for the Company that will help us transform into a consumer-focused company. That vision is "To make lives better by bringing "Quality, Affordable Self-Care Products™" that consumers trust everywhere they are sold." The new vision for the future is designed to support the shifting focus on our consumer branded and store brand portfolio and our global reach and the opportunities for growth we see ahead of us, while remaining loyal to our heritage. The vision represents an evolution from healthcare to self-care, which takes advantage of a massive global trend and opens up a large number of adjacent growth opportunities for the Company.

Competitive Advantage

Our consumer-facing business model combines the unique competencies of a fast-moving consumer goods company and a pharmaceutical manufacturing company with the supply chain breadth necessary to support customers in the markets we serve. These durable business model competencies align with our five strategic pillars and provide us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We fully integrate quality in our operational systems across all products. Our ability to manage our supply chain complexity across multiple dosage forms, formulations, and stock-keeping units, as well as acquisitions, integration, and hundreds of global partners provides value to our customers. Product development capacity and life cycle management are at the core of our operational investments.

Our leadership team is fully engaged in aligning all our metrics and objectives around sustainable compliance with industry associations and regulatory agencies.

Among other things, we believe the following give us a competitive advantage and provide value to our customers:

• On August 9, 2018, we announced a plan to separate our RX business, which, when completed, will enable us to focus on expanding our consumer-facing businesses. We have begun the preparations for the separation, which may include a possible sale, spin-off, merger or other form of separation. While we are currently targeting to complete the separation by the end of 2019, the form of separation may delay its completion beyond this date. In connection with the proposed separation, we anticipate incurring significant preparation costs, excluding restructuring expenses and transaction costs, in the range of $45.0 million to $80.0 million depending on the final structure of a transaction, with a spin-off resulting in costs at the higher end of this range.

Irish Tax Appeals Commission Notice of Amended Assessment

Perrigo Pharma International, a designated activity company organized under the laws of Ireland, formerly known as Elan Pharma International Limited (“Elan Pharma”) and currently a subsidiary of Perrigo Company plc, timely filed an appeal on December 27, 2018 with the Irish Tax Appeals Commission regarding a Notice of Amended Assessment (“NoA”) issued by the Irish Office of the Revenue Commissioners (“Irish Revenue”) for the calendar year

 54

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Consolidated

ended December 31, 2013. The NoA is dated November 29, 2018, and assesses an Irish corporation tax liability against Elan Pharma in the amount of €1,636 million, not including interest or any applicable penalties.

Perrigo acquired Elan Pharma through the December 2013 business combination between Perrigo’s predecessor and Elan Corporation, plc. The NoA relates to the tax treatment of the April 2013 sale by Elan Pharma of Tysabri® intellectual property and related assets to Biogen Idec. As previously reported, the consideration paid by Biogen Idec took the form of an upfront payment and future contingent payments. The upfront payment received from Biogen Idec in 2013 and contingent payments received in subsequent years were recognized as trading income in Elan Pharma’s tax returns filed with Irish Revenue. This treatment is consistent with Elan Pharma’s activities for two
decades relating to the active management of intellectual property rights, which includes acquiring, developing, holding, exploiting, dealing in and disposing of intellectual property rights for use in the pharmaceutical industry.

On October 30, 2018, Irish Revenue issued an audit findings letter to Elan Pharma asserting the claim that (a) IP sales transactions by Elan Pharma, including the sale of Tysabri®, were not part of the trade of Elan Pharma and therefore should have been treated as chargeable gains subject to an effective 33% tax rate, rather than the 12.5% tax rate applicable to trading income, and (b) all amounts received in respect of both the Tysabri® transaction and the related transaction entered into with RPI Finance Trust in 2017 should be taxed in Elan Pharma’s 2013 tax year.

We disagree with both the basis on which Elan Pharma has been assessed and the methodology used to calculate the amount set out in the NoA. We believe the NoA is without merit and that Irish Revenue’s position is incorrect as a matter of law. Accordingly, we filed an appeal of the NoA on December 27, 2018 and will pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues as may be necessary or appropriate. As part of this strategy to pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues, Elan Pharma was, on February 25, 2019, granted leave by the Irish High Court to seek judicial review of the issuance of the NoA. The judicial review filing is based on our belief that Elan Pharma's legitimate expectations as a taxpayer have been breached, not on the merits of the NoA itself. If we are ultimately successful in the judicial review proceedings, the NoA will be invalidated and Irish Revenue will not be able to re-issue the NoA. The proceedings before the Tax Appeals Commission has been stayed until a decision on the judicial review application has been made, which could take up to, or more than, a year. No payment of any amount related to this assessment is required to be made, if at all, until all applicable proceedings have been completed, which could take a number of years. However, while we believe our position to be correct, there can be no assurance of an ultimate favorable outcome, and if the matter is ultimately resolved unfavorably it would have a material adverse impact on us, including on liquidity and capital resources (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Tax related Risks and Item 8. Note 14).

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We continue to experience a significant year-over-year reduction in pricing in our RX segment due to competitive pressures. This softness in pricing is attributable to various factors, including increased focus from customers to capture competition in specific products, supply chain productivity savings, and consolidation of certain customers. While in the fourth quarter of 2018, we experienced a year-over-year decrease in pricing pressure, we expect softness in pricing to continue to impact the segment for the foreseeable future.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On August 24, 2018, we purchased the Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") for Diclofenac Sodium Gel, 3% ("Diclo 3%") for $30.4 million in cash, which we capitalized as a developed product technology intangible asset. Diclo 3% was launched at the end of December 2018.

OTHER

We previously had two legacy segments, Specialty Sciences and Other, which contained our Tysabri® financial asset and API businesses, respectively, which we divested. Following these divestitures, there were no substantial assets or operations left in either of these segments. Effective January 1, 2017, all expenses associated with our former Specialty Sciences segment were moved to unallocated expenses.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the divestment of the Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments if the royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. As a result of this transaction, we transferred the entire financial asset to Royalty Pharma and recorded a $17.1 million gain in Change in financial assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our India API business to Strides Shasun Limited. We received $22.2 million in proceeds, resulting in an immaterial gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to closing the sale, we determined that the carrying value of the India API business exceeded its fair value less the cost to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $35.3 million, which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our Israel API business to SK Capital for a sale price of $110.0 million, which resulted in an immaterial gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Unallocated Expenses

Unallocated expenses are comprised of certain corporate services not allocated to our reporting segments and are recorded above Operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Unallocated expenses were as follows (in millions):

----------------- ----- ----------------- ----------------- ----- - -----

Year Ended
December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016
 $ 150.1 $ 174.7 $ 116.6

The $24.6 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was due primarily to an insurance recovery of $17.8 million, a decrease in legal and consulting fees of $8.7 million and, a decrease in Restructuring expense of $5.5 million related to strategic organizational enhancements; partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $5.2 million.

The $58.1 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was due primarily to an increase in share-based compensation expense of $12.6 million driven primarily by the resignation of certain executives, an increase of $41.1 million of administrative expenses driven by legal fees, consulting fees and employee-related expenses, and an increase in Restructuring expenses of $6.0 million related to strategic organizational enhancements.

Change in Financial Assets

During the year ended December 31, 2018, Tysabri® met the 2018 global net sales threshold resulting in an increase to the asset and a gain of $170.1 million recognized in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Due to higher projected global net sales of Tysabri® and the estimated probability of achieving the 2020 contingent milestone payment, the fair value of the 2020 Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payment increased $18.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we announced the completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma, resulting in a $17.1 million gain. As a result of a decrease in the estimated Tysabri® revenue due to a competitor’s pipeline product, Ocrevus®, the fair value of the Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payments decreased $42.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2016 Ocrevus® entered the market, leading us to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Tysabri® financial asset and reduce the fair value of the Tysabri® financial asset by $2.6 billion.

Interest Expense, Net

The $40.1 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was the result of early debt repayments made during the year ended December 31, 2017.

The $48.5 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was the result of early debt repayments made during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Other (Income) Expense, Net

The $16.2 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was due primarily to the absence of $10.0 million in milestone income related to royalty rights, a $9.5 million loss on our fair value investment securities, and $4.5 million of unfavorable changes in revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies; partially offset by the absence of a $5.9 million loss on hedges related to the extinguishment of debt in the prior year, and a $2.7 million gain on our equity method investments.

The $32.8 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was due primarily to the absence of a $22.3 million equity investment impairment, $8.2 million of favorable changes in revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies and a $3.2 million reduction in equity method losses.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $135.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which consisted of tender premium on debt repayments, transaction costs, write-off of deferred financing fees, and bond discounts.

Income Taxes (Consolidated)

The effective tax rates were as follows:

----------------- - ----------------- ---- ----------------- ---- -

Year Ended
December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016
 54.9 % 57.3 % 17.2 %

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased in comparison to the prior year due primarily to the 2017 sale of API Israel and the one-time U.S. transition toll tax, offset by additional tax expense due to valuation allowances in Belgium and state tax recorded for the future distributions of foreign earnings recorded in 2018. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was higher compared to the year ended

 64

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Unallocated, Interest, Other, and Taxes

December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the valuation allowance position due to current year activity, tax law changes in the U.S. and increases in unrecognized tax benefits, offset by tax law changes in Belgium.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, statutory income tax rate changes in the U.S. and Belgium impacted the effective tax rate with a reduction to U.S. income tax expense of $2.4 million and increased Belgium income tax expense by $24.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, statutory income tax rate changes, primarily in Europe, favorably impacted the effective tax rate by $27.9 million (refer to Item 8. Note 14).

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We finance our operations with internally generated funds, supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing. We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings. In determining our future capital requirements we regularly consider, among other factors, known trends and uncertainties, such as the NoA and other contingencies. In that connection, we note that no payment of the additional amounts assessed by Irish Revenue pursuant to the NoA is currently required, and no such payment is expected to be required, unless and until a final determination of the matter is reached that is adverse to us. Based on the foregoing, management believes that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our short-term and long-term capital requirements, as described below. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of the above factors on liquidity and may determine that modifications to our capital structure are appropriate if market conditions deteriorate, if favorable capital market opportunities become available, or if any change in conditions relating to the NoA or other contingencies has a material impact on our capital requirements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

*    Working capital represents current assets less current liabilities, excluding cash and cash equivalents, and current indebtedness.

Cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings available under our credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to finance our liquidity and capital expenditures in both the short and long term. Although our lenders have made commitments to make funds available to us in a timely fashion under our revolving credit agreements and overdraft facilities, if economic conditions worsen or new information becomes publicly available impacting the institutions’ credit rating or capital ratios, these lenders may be unable or unwilling to lend money pursuant to our existing credit facilities. Should our outlook on liquidity requirements change substantially from current projections, we may seek additional sources of liquidity in the future.

Cash Generated by (Used in) Operating Activities

Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. December 31, 2017

The $105.9 million decrease in operating cash flow was due primarily to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decreased net earnings after adjustments for items such as deferred income taxes, impairment charges, restructuring charges, changes in our financial assets, loss on extinguishment of debt, and depreciation and amortization;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in inventory due primarily to increased volumes and actions to improve customer service in our CHCA segment and increased volumes due to new product launches and changing market dynamics in our RX segment;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accounts payable due primarily to timing of payments, mix of payment terms, and the absence of transactions related to the exited Russian business and prior year distribution phase out initiatives;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accrued income taxes due primarily to U.S. Federal tax obligation payments made in the prior year, offset by expected tax refunds;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accrued liabilities due primarily to the change in royalty and profit sharing accruals; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accounts receivable due primarily to the discontinuation of our Belgium accounts receivable factoring program, more than offset by timing of sales and receipt of payments in our CHCA and RX segments.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016

The $44.0 million increase in operating cash flow was due primarily to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increased net earnings after adjustments for items such as deferred income taxes, impairment charges, restructuring charges, changes in our financial assets, loss on extinguishment of debt, and depreciation and amortization;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accrued customer programs due primarily to new product launches, resulting in higher customer-related accruals, pricing dynamics in the RX segment, as well as timing of rebate and chargeback payments;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accounts payable due primarily to changes to the Omega accounts payable structure that occurred in 2016;

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accrued liabilities due primarily to deferred revenue associated with BCH-Belgium distribution contracts and the absence of accruals related to the sale of our U.S. VMS business; partially offset by increased litigation accruals, and fair market value adjustments related to contingent consideration;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in inventory due to the build up of inventory levels to support customer demands in 2017; offset by improved inventory management in 2016; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accrued income taxes due primarily to Federal tax obligation payments made in the current year, offset by expected tax refunds.

Cash Generated by (Used in) Investing Activities

Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. December 31, 2017

The $2.5 billion decrease in investing cash flow was due primarily to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Absence of the prior year completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma, for which we received $2.2 billion in cash;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Absence of prior year net proceeds from sale of business and other assets of $149.4 million;

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• Decreased proceeds from royalty rights of $73.6 million; and

• Asset acquisitions of $35.6 million related primarily to Diclo 3%.

Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $102.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $88.6 million in the prior year. The increase in cash used for capital expenditures was due primarily to the increase in the number of manufacturing projects in the current year compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be between $145.0 million and $209.0 million related to manufacturing productivity, increased tablet and infant formula capacity and quality/regulatory projects. We expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures with funds from operating cash flows.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016

The $2.5 billion increase in investing cash flow was due primarily to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma, for which we received $2.2 billion in cash;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Absence of the prior year acquisition of a portfolio of generic dosage forms and strengths of Retin-A®, a topical prescription acne treatment from Mattawan Pharmaceuticals, LLC for $416.4 million; and

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $88.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $106.2 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash used for capital expenditures was due primarily to the decrease in the number of manufacturing projects in the current year compared to the prior year.

Cash Generated by (Used in) Financing Activities

Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. December 31, 2017

The $2.4 billion increase in financing cash flow was due primarily to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• An increase in share repurchases of $208.5 million.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016

- ------------------------------------------------------------------

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
• Share repurchases of $191.5 million in 2017; partially offset by

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A decrease in borrowings (repayments) of revolving credit agreements and other financing, net of $809.3 million.

Share Repurchases

The declaration and payment of dividends, if any, is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, availability of distributable reserves, capital and surplus requirements, and other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant.

Borrowings and Capital Resources

Overdraft Facilities

We have overdraft facilities available that we use to support our cash management operations. We report any balances outstanding in "Other Financing" in Item 8, Note 10. There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities at December 31, 2018. The balance outstanding under the overdraft facilities was $6.9 million at December 31, 2017.

Accounts Receivable Factoring

We have accounts receivable factoring arrangements with non-related third-party financial institutions (the “Factors”). Pursuant to the terms of the arrangements, we sell to the Factors certain of our accounts receivable balances on a non-recourse basis for credit approved accounts. An administrative fee per invoice is charged on the gross amount of accounts receivables assigned to the Factors, and interest is calculated at the applicable EUR LIBOR rate plus a spread. The total amount factored on a non-recourse basis and excluded from accounts receivable was $24.3 million and $27.5 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Revolving Credit Agreements

On March 8, 2018, we terminated the revolving credit agreement entered into in December 2014 (the "2014 Revolver") and entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement maturing on March 8, 2023 (the "2018 Revolver"). There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Revolver as of December 31, 2018 or under the 2014 Revolver as of December 31, 2017.

Debt Repayments

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we reduced our outstanding debt by $2.6 billion through a variety of early redemption and tender offer transactions.

We are in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of December 31, 2018.

Credit Ratings

Our credit ratings on December 31, 2018 were Baa3 (stable) and BBB- (stable) by Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Rating Services, respectively.

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in operating performance, the economic environment, our financial position, and changes in business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, and vendor financing terms.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into R&D arrangements with third parties that often require milestone payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the product. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in our table of contractual obligations below.

We fund our U.S. qualified profit-sharing and investment plan in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and Internal Revenue Service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction. We are committed to making the required minimum contributions, which we expect to be approximately $22.8 million over the next 12 months. Future contributions are dependent upon various factors, including employees’ eligible compensation, plan participation and changes, if any, to current funding requirements. Therefore, no amounts were included in the Contractual Obligations table above. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities.

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $463.9 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. These unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above due to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of settlement with taxing authorities.

Net deferred income tax liabilities were $281.1 million as of December 31, 2018. This amount is not included in the Contractual Obligations table above because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Net deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling net deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The determination of certain amounts in our financial statements requires the use of estimates. These estimates are based upon our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances. Although the estimates are considered reasonable based on the currently available information, actual results could differ from the estimates we have used. Management considers the below accounting estimates to require the most judgment and to be the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates are reviewed by the Audit Committee.

Revenue Recognition

Net product sales include estimates of variable consideration for which accruals and allowances are established. Variable consideration for product sales consists primarily of chargebacks, rebates, other incentive programs, and related administrative fees recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accrued customer programs, and sales returns and shelf stock allowances recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a reduction to Accounts receivable. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes in which relevant factors, such as historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns, are either probability-weighted to derive an estimate of expected value or the estimate reflects the single most likely outcome. Overall, these reserves reflect the best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the estimates, these estimates are adjusted, which would affect revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.

The aggregate gross-to-net adjustments related to RX products can exceed 50% of the segment's gross sales. In contrast, the aggregate gross-to-net adjustments related to CHCA and CHCI typically do not exceed 10% of the segment's gross sales. The following table summarizes the activity in Accrued customer programs and allowance accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions):

Critical Accounting Estimates

Chargebacks

We market and sell U.S. Rx pharmaceutical products directly to wholesalers, distributors, warehousing pharmacy chains, and other direct purchasing groups. We also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies, non-warehousing chains, managed care organizations, and group purchasing organizations, (collectively referred to as "indirect customers"). In addition, we enter into agreements with some indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products. These indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, we may pre-authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers. Under either arrangement, we provide chargeback credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler's invoice price. The accrual for chargebacks includes an estimate for outstanding claims that occurred but for which the related claim has not yet been paid, and an estimate for future claims that will be made when the wholesaler inventory is sold to the indirect customer. This estimate is based on historical chargeback experience, which includes sell-through levels by wholesalers to retailers, and confirmed wholesaler inventory levels. We regularly assess current pricing dynamics and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.

Medicaid Rebates

We participate in certain qualifying U.S. federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating government entities. Medicaid rebates are amounts owed based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector (Medicaid) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. Medicaid reserves are based on expected payments, which are driven by patient usage, contract performance, and field inventory that will be subject to a Medicaid rebate. Medicaid rebates are typically billed up to 180 days after the product is shipped, but can be billed as many as 270 days after the quarter in which the product is dispensed to the Medicaid participant. As a result, our Medicaid rebate provision includes an estimate of outstanding claims for end-customer sales that occurred but for which the related claim has not been billed, and an estimate for future claims that will be made when inventory in the distribution channel is sold through to plan participants. Our calculation also requires other estimates, such as estimates of sales mix, to determine which sales are subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. Our rebates are reviewed on a monthly basis against actual claims data to ensure the liability is fairly stated.

Returns and Shelf Stock Allowances

We maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Generally, product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. The majority of our product returns are the result of product dating, which falls within the range set by our policy, and are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer. Our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns, which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which our customers may return product. The period is based on the shelf life of the products at the time of shipment. Additionally, when establishing our reserves, we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch, entrance into the market of additional competition, and changes in formulations.

Shelf stock allowances are credits issued to reflect changes in the selling price of a product and are based upon estimates of the amount of product remaining in a customer's inventory at the time of the anticipated price change. In many cases, the customer is contractually entitled to such a credit. The allowances for shelf stock adjustments are based on specified terms with certain customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, and estimated changes in market price.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

RX Administrative Fees and Other Rebates

Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations, and end-user customers. Settlement of rebates and fees generally may occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Estimates used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes, and average contract pricing.

CHCA and CHCI Rebates and Other Allowances

In the CHCA and CHCI segments, we offer certain customers a volume incentive rebate if specific levels of product purchases are made during a specified period. The accrual for rebates is based on contractual agreements and estimated levels of purchasing. In addition, we have a reserve for product returns, primarily related to damaged and unsaleable products. We also have agreements with certain customers to cover promotional activities related to our products such as coupon programs, new store allowances, and product displays. The accrual for these activities is based on customer agreements and is established at the time product revenue is recognized.

Allowances for customer-related programs are generally recorded at the time of sale based on the estimates and methodologies described above. We continually monitor product sales provisions and re-evaluate these estimates as additional information becomes available, which includes, among other things, an assessment of current market conditions, trade inventory levels, and customer product mix. We make adjustments to these provisions at the end of each reporting period to reflect any such updates to the relevant facts and circumstances.

Income Taxes

Our tax rate is subject to adjustment over the balance of the year due to, among other things, income tax rate changes by governments; the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to our interpretation of transfer pricing standards; changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws (for example, proposals for fundamental U.S. and international tax reform); changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; expiration of or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and the repatriation of earnings with respect to which we have not previously provided taxes.

Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments (refer to Item 8. Note 14).

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in product liability, patent, commercial, regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within that range is a better estimate, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. We have established reserves for certain of our legal matters. We also separately record any insurance recoveries that are probable to occur (refer to Item 8. Note 16).

Change in Financial Assets

We valued our contingent milestone payments from Royalty Pharma using a modified Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model ("BSOPM"). Key inputs in the BSOPM are the estimated volatility and rate of return of royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma until the contingent milestones are resolved. Volatility and the estimated fair value of the milestones have a positive relationship such that higher volatility translates to a higher estimated fair value of the contingent milestone payments. We assess volatility and rate of

 74

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

return inputs quarterly by analyzing certain market volatility benchmarks and the risk associated with Royalty Pharma achieving the underlying projected royalties. The table below represents the volatility and rate of return:

-------------- ----------------- - ----------------- ---- -

 Year Ended
 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017
Volatility 30.0 % 30.0 %
Rate of return 8.05 % 8.07 %

In order for us to receive the 2020 milestone payment, Royalty Pharma contingent payments for Tysabri® sales in 2020 must exceed $351.0 million. If Royalty Pharma contingent payments for Tysabri® sales do not meet the prescribed threshold in 2020, we will write off the $73.2 million asset as an expense. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will increase the asset to $400.0 million and recognize income of $326.8 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (refer to Item 8. Note 7).

Goodwill

Goodwill represents amounts paid for an acquisition in excess of the fair value of net assets received. We have six reporting units subject to impairment testing annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events suggest an impairment may exist. We had triggering events during the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2018 and therefore performed an interim impairment test in the third quarter of 2018, followed by our annual test performed as of September 30, 2018, the first day of our fourth quarter. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows and market valuation multiples. The estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows that include assumptions about future performance. The discount rates used in testing each of our reporting units’ goodwill for impairment during our interim and annual testing were based on the weighted average cost of capital determined for each of our reporting units and ranged from 8.5% to 13.8%. Perpetual growth rates for each reporting unit ranged from 2.0% to 3.0%. Changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss. We recorded goodwill impairment losses of $136.7 million related to animal health and $1.1 billion related to BCH and Specialty Sciences during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No goodwill impairments were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.

During our annual goodwill testing as of September 30, 2018, we determined the fair value of the BCH reporting unit included in the CHCI segment was less than 10.0% higher than its net book value. We performed additional quantitative analysis during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and concluded that the fair value of the BCH reporting unit remained less than 10% higher than its net book value as of December 31, 2018. As a result of the relatively narrow margin between fair value and net book value during the three months ended December 31, 2018, this reporting unit is inherently at a higher risk for future impairments if it experiences deterioration in business performance or market multiples or increases in discount rates.

The discounted cash flow forecasts used for the BCH reporting unit include assumptions about future activity levels in the near term and longer-term. If growth in this reporting unit is lower than expected, we may experience deterioration in our cash flow forecasts that may indicate goodwill in the reporting unit may be impaired in future impairment tests. We continue to monitor the progress and assess the reporting unit for potential impairment should impairment indicators arise, as applicable, and at least annually during our fourth quarter impairment testing.

Management performed sensitivity analyses on the discounted cash flow valuations that were prepared to estimate the enterprise values of each reporting unit. Discount rates were increased and decreased by increments of 50 basis points, up to cumulative increases and decreases of 250 basis points. Perpetual revenue growth rates were increased and decreased by increments of 25 or 50 basis points, up to cumulative increases and decreases of 100 basis points.

 75

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate, or different combinations of changes in discount rate and the perpetual revenue growth rate, would indicate potential impairment for this reporting unit. Based on the sensitivity of the discount rate assumption on the BCH reporting unit analysis, an increase in the discount rate over the next twelve months could negatively impact the estimated fair value of this reporting unit and lead to a future impairment. Certain macroeconomic factors which are not controlled by the reporting unit, such as rising inflation or interest rates, could cause an increase in the discount rate to occur. Deterioration in BCH performance over the next twelve months, such as lower than expected revenue or profitability that has a sustained impact on future periods, could also represent potential indicators of impairment requiring further impairment analysis.

We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, India, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. In August 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million. The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The results of RB Foods' operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition.

Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities.

Perrigo Pharma International, a designated activity company organized under the laws of Ireland, formerly known as Elan Pharma International Limited (“Elan Pharma”) and currently a subsidiary of Perrigo Company plc, timely filed an appeal on December 27, 2018 with the Irish Tax Appeals Commission regarding a Notice of Amended Assessment (“NoA”) issued by the Irish Office of the Revenue Commissioners (“Irish Revenue”) for the calendar year

 54

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Consolidated

ended December 31, 2013. The NoA is dated November 29, 2018, and assesses an Irish corporation tax liability against Elan Pharma in the amount of €1,636 million, not including interest or any applicable penalties.

Perrigo acquired Elan Pharma through the December 2013 business combination between Perrigo’s predecessor and Elan Corporation, plc. The NoA relates to the tax treatment of the April 2013 sale by Elan Pharma of Tysabri® intellectual property and related assets to Biogen Idec. As previously reported, the consideration paid by Biogen Idec took the form of an upfront payment and future contingent payments. The upfront payment received from Biogen Idec in 2013 and contingent payments received in subsequent years were recognized as trading income in Elan Pharma’s tax returns filed with Irish Revenue. This treatment is consistent with Elan Pharma’s activities for two
decades relating to the active management of intellectual property rights, which includes acquiring, developing, holding, exploiting, dealing in and disposing of intellectual property rights for use in the pharmaceutical industry.

On October 30, 2018, Irish Revenue issued an audit findings letter to Elan Pharma asserting the claim that (a) IP sales transactions by Elan Pharma, including the sale of Tysabri®, were not part of the trade of Elan Pharma and therefore should have been treated as chargeable gains subject to an effective 33% tax rate, rather than the 12.5% tax rate applicable to trading income, and (b) all amounts received in respect of both the Tysabri® transaction and the related transaction entered into with RPI Finance Trust in 2017 should be taxed in Elan Pharma’s 2013 tax year.

We disagree with both the basis on which Elan Pharma has been assessed and the methodology used to calculate the amount set out in the NoA. We believe the NoA is without merit and that Irish Revenue’s position is incorrect as a matter of law. Accordingly, we filed an appeal of the NoA on December 27, 2018 and will pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues as may be necessary or appropriate. As part of this strategy to pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues, Elan Pharma was, on February 25, 2019, granted leave by the Irish High Court to seek judicial review of the issuance of the NoA. The judicial review filing is based on our belief that Elan Pharma']:

This softness in pricing is attributable to various factors, including increased focus from customers to capture competition in specific products, supply chain productivity savings, and consolidation of certain customers.

We previously had two legacy segments, Specialty Sciences and Other, which contained our Tysabri® financial asset and API businesses, respectively, which we divested. Following these divestitures, there were no substantial assets or operations left in either of these segments. Effective January 1, 2017, all expenses associated with our former Specialty Sciences segment were moved to unallocated expenses.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the divestment of the Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, consisting of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments if the royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. As a result of this transaction, we transferred the entire financial asset to Royalty Pharma and recorded a $17.1 million gain in Change in financial assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our India API business to Strides Shasun Limited. We received $22.2 million in proceeds, resulting in an immaterial gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to closing the sale, we determined that the carrying value of the India API business exceeded its fair value less the cost to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $35.3 million, which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Change in Financial Assets

During the year ended December 31, 2018, Tysabri® met the 2018 global net sales threshold resulting in an increase to the asset and a gain of $170.1 million recognized in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Due to higher projected global net sales of Tysabri® and the estimated probability of achieving the 2020 contingent milestone payment, the fair value of the 2020 Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payment increased $18.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we announced the completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma, resulting in a $17.1 million gain. As a result of a decrease in the estimated Tysabri® revenue due to a competitor’s pipeline product, Ocrevus®, the fair value of the Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payments decreased $42.0 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2016 Ocrevus® entered the market, leading us to evaluate strategic alternatives for the Tysabri® financial asset and reduce the fair value of the Tysabri® financial asset by $2.6 billion.

Interest Expense, Net

The $40.1 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was the result of early debt repayments made during the year ended December 31, 2017.

The $48.5 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was the result of early debt repayments made during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Other (Income) Expense, Net

The $16.2 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was due primarily to the absence of $10.0 million in milestone income related to royalty rights, a $9.5 million loss on our fair value investment securities, and $4.5 million of unfavorable changes in revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies; partially offset by the absence of a $5.9 million loss on hedges related to the extinguishment of debt in the prior year, and a $2.7 million gain on our equity method investments.

The $32.8 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year was due primarily to the absence of a $22.3 million equity investment impairment, $8.2 million of favorable changes in revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies and a $3.2 million reduction in equity method losses.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $135.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which consisted of tender premium on debt repayments, transaction costs, write-off of deferred financing fees, and bond discounts.

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased in comparison to the prior year due primarily to the 2017 sale of API Israel and the one-time U.S. transition toll tax, offset by additional tax expense due to valuation allowances in Belgium and state tax recorded for the future distributions of foreign earnings recorded in 2018. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was higher compared to the year ended

December 31, 2016 due to an increase in the valuation allowance position due to current year activity, tax law changes in the U.S. and increases in unrecognized tax benefits, offset by tax law changes in Belgium.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, statutory income tax rate changes in the U.S. and Belgium impacted the effective tax rate with a reduction to U.S. income tax expense of $2.4 million and increased Belgium income tax expense by $24.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, statutory income tax rate changes, primarily in Europe, favorably impacted the effective tax rate by $27.9 million (refer to Item 8. Note 14).

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We finance our operations with internally generated funds, supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing. We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings. In determining our future capital requirements we regularly consider, among other factors, known trends and uncertainties, such as the NoA and other contingencies. In that connection, we note that no payment of the additional amounts assessed by Irish Revenue pursuant to the NoA is currently required, and no such payment is expected to be required, unless and until a final determination of the matter is reached that is adverse to us. Based on the foregoing, management believes that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our short-term and long-term capital requirements, as described below. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of the above factors on liquidity and may determine that modifications to our capital structure are appropriate if market conditions deteriorate, if favorable capital market opportunities become available, or if any change in conditions relating to the NoA or other contingencies has a material impact on our capital requirements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

*    Working capital represents current assets less current liabilities, excluding cash and cash equivalents, and current indebtedness.

Cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings available under our credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to finance our liquidity and capital expenditures in both the short and long term. Although our lenders have made commitments to make funds available to us in a timely fashion under our revolving credit agreements and overdraft facilities, if economic conditions worsen or new information becomes publicly available impacting the institutions’ credit rating or capital ratios, these lenders may be unable or unwilling to lend money pursuant to our existing credit facilities. Should our outlook on liquidity requirements change substantially from current projections, we may seek additional sources of liquidity in the future.

• Changes in accounts receivable due primarily to the discontinuation of our Belgium accounts receivable factoring program, more than offset by timing of sales and receipt of payments in our CHCA and RX segments.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016

The $44.0 million increase in operating cash flow was due primarily to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increased net earnings after adjustments for items such as deferred income taxes, impairment charges, restructuring charges, changes in our financial assets, loss on extinguishment of debt, and depreciation and amortization;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accrued customer programs due primarily to new product launches, resulting in higher customer-related accruals, pricing dynamics in the RX segment, as well as timing of rebate and chargeback payments;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accounts payable due primarily to changes to the Omega accounts payable structure that occurred in 2016;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accrued liabilities due primarily to deferred revenue associated with BCH-Belgium distribution contracts and the absence of accruals related to the sale of our U.S. VMS business; partially offset by increased litigation accruals, and fair market value adjustments related to contingent consideration;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in inventory due to the build up of inventory levels to support customer demands in 2017; offset by improved inventory management in 2016; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in accrued income taxes due primarily to Federal tax obligation payments made in the current year, offset by expected tax refunds.

Cash Generated by (Used in) Investing Activities

Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. December 31, 2017

The $2.5 billion decrease in investing cash flow was due primarily to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Absence of the prior year completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma, for which we received $2.2 billion in cash;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Absence of prior year net proceeds from sale of business and other assets of $149.4 million;

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• Decreased proceeds from royalty rights of $73.6 million; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asset acquisitions of $35.6 million related primarily to Diclo 3%.

Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $102.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $88.6 million in the prior year. The increase in cash used for capital expenditures was due primarily to the increase in the number of manufacturing projects in the current year compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be between $145.0 million and $209.0 million related to manufacturing productivity, increased tablet and infant formula capacity and quality/regulatory projects. We expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures with funds from operating cash flows.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016

The $2.5 billion increase in investing cash flow was due primarily to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Completed divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma, for which we received $2.2 billion in cash;

• Absence of the prior year acquisition of a portfolio of generic dosage forms and strengths of Retin-A®, a topical prescription acne treatment from Mattawan Pharmaceuticals, LLC for $416.4 million; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Absence of the prior year acquisition of Generic Benzaclin™ product rights for $62.0 million; partially offset by

Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $88.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $106.2 million in the prior year. The decrease in cash used for capital expenditures was due primarily to the decrease in the number of manufacturing projects in the current year compared to the prior year.

Cash Generated by (Used in) Financing Activities

Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. December 31, 2017

The $2.4 billion increase in financing cash flow was due primarily to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decrease in payments on long-term debt and premium on early debt retirement of $2.1 billion and $116.1 million, respectively, due to debt extinguishment in 2017; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Issuance of $431.0 million of long-term debt in the current year; partially offset by

- ---------------------------------------------------
• An increase in share repurchases of $208.5 million.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016

The $2.7 billion decrease in financing cash flow was due primarily to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in payments on long-term debt and premium on early debt retirement of $2.1 billion and $115.5 million, respectively, due to debt extinguishment in 2017;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• Absence of issuance of long-term debt of $1.2 billion in 2016; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A decrease in borrowings (repayments) of revolving credit agreements and other financing, net of $809.3 million.

Share Repurchases

In October 2018, our Board of Directors authorized up to $1.0 billion of share repurchases with no expiration date, subject to the Board of Directors’ approval of the pricing parameters and amount that may be repurchased under each specific share repurchase program.

Dividends

In January 2003, the Board of Directors adopted a policy of paying quarterly dividends. We paid dividends as follows:

---------------------------- ----------------- ----- ----------------- ----------------- ---- - ----

 Year Ended

Dividends paid (in millions) $ 104.9 $ 91.1 $ 83.2
Dividends paid per share $ 0.76 $ 0.64 $ 0.58

The declaration and payment of dividends, if any, is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, availability of distributable reserves, capital and surplus requirements, and other factors our Board of Directors may consider relevant.

['s Rating Services, respectively.

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in operating performance, the economic environment, our financial position, and changes in business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, and vendor financing terms.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into R&D arrangements with third parties that often require milestone payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the product. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in our table of contractual obligations below.

Contractual Obligations

Our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of December 31, 2018 are set forth in the following table. Some of the amounts included in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including the duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligations actually paid in future periods may vary from the amounts reflected in the table (in millions):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------- ------- --------- ---- --------- ------- ---------- ----- ----- ----- ------- - -------

 Payment Due
 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 After 2023 Total
Short and long-term debt (1) $ 313.5 $ 1,113.9 $ 557.3 $ 2,297.1 $ 4,281.8
Capital lease obligations 1.1 1.5 0.7 — 3.3
Purchase obligations (2) 754.0 4.2 0.1 — 758.3

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Short-term and long-term debt includes interest payments, which were calculated using the effective interest rate at December 31, 2018.

--- --------------------------------------------------------
(2) Consists of commitments for both materials and services.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Used in normal course of business, principally for warehouse facilities and computer equipment.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Includes amounts associated with non-qualified plans related to deferred compensation, executive retention and post employment benefits. Of this amount, we have funded $31.5 million, which is recorded in Other non-current assets on the balance sheet. These amounts are assumed payable after five years, although certain circumstances, such as termination, would require earlier payment.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Primarily includes consulting fees, legal settlements, contingent consideration obligations, restructuring accruals, insurance obligations, and electrical and gas purchase contracts, which were accrued in Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2018 for all years.

We fund our U.S. qualified profit-sharing and investment plan in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and Internal Revenue Service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction. We are committed to making the required minimum contributions, which we expect to be approximately $22.8 million over the next 12 months. Future contributions are dependent upon various factors, including employees’ eligible compensation, plan participation and changes, if any, to current funding requirements. Therefore, no amounts were included in the Contractual Obligations table above. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities.

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $463.9 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. These unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above due to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of settlement with taxing authorities.

Net deferred income tax liabilities were $281.1 million as of December 31, 2018. This amount is not included in the Contractual Obligations table above because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Net deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling net deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Critical Accounting Estimates

The determination of certain amounts in our financial statements requires the use of estimates. These estimates are based upon our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances. Although the estimates are considered reasonable based on the currently available information, actual results could differ from the estimates we have used. Management considers the below accounting estimates to require the most judgment and to be the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates are reviewed by the Audit Committee.

Revenue Recognition

Net product sales include estimates of variable consideration for which accruals and allowances are established. Variable consideration for product sales consists primarily of chargebacks, rebates, other incentive programs, and related administrative fees recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accrued customer programs, and sales returns and shelf stock allowances recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a reduction to Accounts receivable. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes in which relevant factors, such as historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns, are either probability-weighted to derive an estimate of expected value or the estimate reflects the single most likely outcome. Overall, these reserves reflect the best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the estimates, these estimates are adjusted, which would affect revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.

The aggregate gross-to-net adjustments related to RX products can exceed 50% of the segment']:
