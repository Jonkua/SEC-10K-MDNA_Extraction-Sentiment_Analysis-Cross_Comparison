• In June 2018, we entered into a revolving, unsecured credit agreement that provides for borrowings of up to $1.0 billion and matures on June 21, 2023 (the “2018 Credit Agreement”) to replace our existing revolving, unsecured credit agreement.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We announced our exclusive collaboration with DuPont as the primary hydroprocessing catalyst manufacturer for the DuPont™ IsoTherming® hydroprocessing technology, making clean fuels production more cost efficient for refiners. IsoTherming® is an innovative hydroprocessing technology that can lower capital and operational costs.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We launched XPLORE™, a new platform for the clean transportation fuels market. The XPLORE catalyst platform is the result of breakthrough research in hyrdroprocessing catalyst technology allowing refineries to produce clean transportation fuels in a more efficient way. The new PULSAR family, with KF 787 PULSAR™ as its first grade product, is a cutting-edge, premium catalyst line, designed for the production of clean diesel.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We entered into two separate $250 million ASR agreements in May and August 2018, respectively. We completed these ASR agreements in September and December 2018, respectively, receiving and retiring a total of 5,262,654 shares.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We successfully completed the commissioning of our La Negra facility in Chile (“La Negra II”), which has a nameplate capacity of 20,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate. Upon completion of the ramp-up of La Negra II, the total capacity of our facilities in La Negra, Chile will be 44,000 metric tons.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We completed pre-commissioning activities related to our new facility in Xinyu, China and began start-up activities. This expansion will result in an additional 20,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide, bringing total site capacity to 30,000 metric tons, with significant volumes expected from the new unit in 2019.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 50% interest in Mineral Resources Limited's Wodgina Project in Western Australia and form a joint venture with Mineral Resources Limited to own and operate the Wodgina Project to produce spodumene concentrate and battery grade lithium hydroxide, for a purchase price of $1.15 billion. The joint venture will ultimately construct a battery grade lithium hydroxide plant at the resource site. This transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the second half of 2019.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We received the required environmental approvals from Australian federal and state government for the Company’s proposed Kemerton lithium hydroxide conversion site in Western Australia. This plant will have an initial capacity of 60,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide with an ability to expand to 100,000 metric tons over time. The commissioning of this site is expected to start in stages during the course of 2021.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In December 2018, we exercised an $18 million option to purchase undeveloped land with access to a lithium resource in Antofalla, within the Catamarca Province of Argentina from Bolland Minera S.A. We believe this asset could be certified as the largest lithium resource in Argentina.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We achieved earnings of $693.6 million during 2018 as compared to $54.9 million for 2017. Cash flows from operations in 2018 were $546.2 million. Earnings for 2018 included a $169.9 million after-tax gain from the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture, while earnings for 2017 were negatively impacted by the $366.9 million net income tax expense resulting from the enactment of the TCJA. In addition, earnings for 2018 includes pension and other postretirement benefit (“OPEB”) actuarial losses of $10.6 million after income taxes, compared to pension and OPEB actuarial gains of $7.3 million after income taxes in 2017.

Outlook
The current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve. In particular, the market for lithium battery and energy storage continues to accelerate, providing the opportunity to continue to develop high quality and innovative products while managing the high cost of expanding capacity. The other markets we serve continue to present various opportunities for value and growth as we have positioned ourselves to manage the impact on our business of changing global conditions, such as slow and uneven global growth, currency exchange volatility, crude oil price fluctuation, a dynamic pricing environment, an ever-changing landscape in electronics, the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers and increasingly stringent environmental standards. Amidst these dynamics, we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically well-positioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes, optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio primarily through pricing and product development, managing costs and delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We believe that our businesses remain well-positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and long-term trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to changes in economic conditions in these markets.
Lithium: We expect a similar rate of growth in 2019 as in 2018 in Lithium, led by continued strong demand in battery-grade applications, price improvement and increased conversion capacity.

29

--------------------------------------

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

On a longer term basis, we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new lithium applications advance and the use of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and full battery electric vehicles increases. This demand for lithium is supported against a favorable backdrop of steadily declining lithium ion battery costs, increasing battery performance and an increasingly favorable global public policy toward acceptance of e-mobility/renewable energy usage. Our long-term outlook is also bolstered by our successful negotiation of long-term supply agreements with our key strategic customers, reflecting our standing as a preferred global lithium partner, highlighted by our scale, access to geographically diverse, low-cost resource base and long-term focus on execution.
Bromine Specialties: We expect to see continued growth in net sales and profitability in 2019, due to healthy demand and pricing for our flame retardants and other derivatives. However, with sustained low oil prices, we expect stable, albeit low, drilling completion fluid demand throughout the year. While it is possible oil prices could continue to rebound some in 2019, the short-term impact will be to increase raw material costs. Offshore well completions lag oil pricing, so any benefit in completion fluid volumes would likely extend throughout the year.
On a longer term basis, we continue to believe that improving global standards of living, widespread digitization, increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products. Absent an increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling, we would expect this business to follow a long-term growth trajectory once oil prices recover from recent levels as we expect that deep water drilling will continue to increase around the world. We are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets. We believe the global supply/demand gap could tighten as demand for existing and possible new uses of bromine expands over time. The combination of solid, long-term business fundamentals, with our strong cost position, product innovations and effective management of raw material costs will enable us to manage our business through end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets.
Catalysts: We expect to see continued headwinds from rising raw material costs in both our CFT and FCC businesses, similar to 2018.
On a longer term basis, we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels, new refinery start-ups and ongoing adoption of cleaner fuels will be the primary drivers of growth in our Catalysts business. We believe delivering superior end-use performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry. We believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world, including those managing new contaminants present in North America tight oil, and those in the Middle East and Asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields. Longer term, we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour, a trend that bodes well for our catalysts portfolio. With superior technology and production capacities, and expected growth in end market demand, we believe that Catalysts remains well-positioned for the future. In PCS, we expect growth in our organometallic business due to growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending.
On April 3, 2018, we completed the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture to W.R. Grace & Co. for net cash proceeds of approximately $413.6 million.
All Other: The fine chemistry services business will continue to be reported outside the Company’s reportable segments as it does not fit in the Company’s core businesses. We expect the near future to be impacted by a challenging agriculture industry environment and the timing of customer orders in pharmaceuticals. We continue to work to reinvigorate the pipeline of new products and services to these markets.
Corporate: We continue to focus on cash generation, working capital management and process efficiencies. We expect our global effective tax rate for 2019 to be between 23% and 24%; however, our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the U.S., including the TCJA, and other tax jurisdictions.
In the first quarter of 2019, we increased our quarterly dividend rate to $0.3675 per share. During 2018, we received and retired approximately 5.3 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program and ASR agreements, and we may periodically repurchase shares in the future on an opportunistic basis as approved by our share repurchase program.
Actuarial gains and losses related to our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations are reflected in Corporate as a component of non-operating pension and OPEB plan costs under mark-to-market accounting. Results for the year ended

Comparison of 2018 to 2017
Net Sales
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded net sales of $3.37 billion, a 10% increase compared to net sales of $3.07 billion for the corresponding period of 2017. Net sales increased, including in all three reportable segments, due to $210.6 million of higher volumes, $141.0 million of favorable pricing impacts and $30.6 million of favorable currency exchange. This was partially offset by $78.9 million of net sales from the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture.
Gross Profit
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our gross profit increased $111.0 million, or 10%, compared to the corresponding period of 2017. Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2018 included a decrease of $13.4 million in acquisition, integration and restructuring related costs from various significant projects compared to the corresponding period in 2017, and $8.8 million related to non-routine labor and compensation related costs in Chile that are outside normal compensation arrangements. In addition, Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $23.1 million charge related to the markup of inventory purchased as part of the acquisition of Jiangli New Materials and $30.4 million of gross profit from the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture. In addition, gross profit increased $19.6 million in Catalysts and Bromine Specialties due to the year over year impact of hurricane Harvey, which includes a partial insurance claim reimbursement of $4.2 million in 2018. Excluding the impact of these items, gross profit increased by $93.9 million, or 8.3%, due to $141.0 million in favorable pricing impacts and approximately $77 million of higher volumes, more than offsetting higher material and utility costs of approximately $60 million and price-related royalties of approximately $30 million. Additionally higher production costs and the negative impact of currency exchange on material and production costs in foreign locations resulted in approximately $30 million in offsets. Overall, these factors contributed to a gross profit margin for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 of 36.1% and 36.0%, respectively.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses decreased $4.2 million, or 1%, from the year ended December 31, 2017. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $16.2 million of charitable contributions beyond the Company’s ordinary, recurring charitable contributions, a decrease in restructuring and other costs related to several locations of $4.7 million and $3.9 million less acquisition and integration related costs for various significant projects. The remaining decrease was primarily due to lower compensation related costs, particularly incentive compensation, and professional fees. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 13.2% in 2018, compared to 14.7% in 2017.
Research and Development Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our R&D expenses decreased $14.3 million, or 17%, from the year ended December 31, 2017. Included in R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 are $5.7 million of restructuring costs related to our Lithium sites in Germany. The remaining decrease was primarily due to $4.5 million of R&D expenses related to the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses were 2.1% in 2018, compared to 2.7% in 2017.
Gain on Sales of Businesses, Net
The year ended December 31, 2018 included a gain before income taxes of $210.4 million related to the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture, which we completed in the second quarter of 2018.
Interest and Financing Expenses
Interest and financing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $62.9 million to $52.4 million from the corresponding 2017 period, due mainly to a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $52.8 million in 2017 relating to the tender premiums, fees, unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the repayment of the 3.00% Senior notes in full, €307.0 million of the 1.875% Senior notes and $174.7 million of the 4.50% Senior notes. The remaining difference is primarily related to the impact of higher capitalized interest from increased capital expenditures in 2018.
Other Expenses, Net
Other expenses, net, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $64.4 million compared to $9.5 million for the corresponding 2017 period. Other expenses, net for 2018 included approximately $5.3 million of pension and OPEB costs (including mark-to-market actuarial losses of $14.0 million) as compared to $16.1 million of pension and OPEB benefits

--------------------------------------

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

(including mark-to-market actuarial gains of $11.4 million) in 2017. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $27.0 million of legal expenses related to products that Albemarle no longer manufactures and a previously disposed business, $19.7 million to increase an indemnification liability related to the settlement of an ongoing audit of a previously disposed business in Germany and $15.6 million of environmental charges related to a site formerly owned by Albemarle, partially offset by a $2.1 million gain in the fair value of our investment in private equity securities. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $28.7 million reserve recorded against a note receivable in one of our European entities no longer deemed probable of collection, $11.0 million of charges related to previously disposed properties or businesses, partially offset by a $10.6 million gain related to the reversal of liabilities recorded as part of purchase accounting from a previous acquisition, a $6.2 million gain related to the acquisition of the 50% interest of an equity investment and $1.1 million related to a reversal of a liability associated with the previous disposal of a property. The remaining change was primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses totaling $0.6 million and a decrease in interest income.
The mark-to-market actuarial loss in 2018 is primarily attributable to a lower return on pension plan assets in 2018 than was expected, as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance. The weighted-average actual return on our U.S. and foreign pension plan assets was (4.55)% versus an expected return of 6.73%. The mark-to-market actuarial loss in 2018 was partially offset by an increase in the weighted-average discount rate to 4.59% from 4.03% for our U.S. pension plans and to 2.15% from 1.94% for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2018 measurement date.
The mark-to-market actuarial gain in 2017 is primarily attributable to a higher return on pension plan assets in 2017 than was expected, as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance. The weighted-average actual return on our U.S. and foreign pension plan assets was 14.31% versus an expected return of 6.73%. The mark-to-market actuarial gain in 2017 was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate to 4.03% from 4.43% for our U.S. pension plans and to 1.94% from 2.00% for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2017 measurement date.
Income Tax Expense
The effective income tax rate for 2018 was 18.2% compared to 96.6% for 2017. Our effective income tax rate for 2018 was primarily affected by a tax benefit of $42.3 million related to the refinement of the one-time transition tax during the period defined by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”). In addition, our effective income tax rate was impacted by the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates.
Our effective income tax rate for 2017 was primarily affected by the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. During 2017, provisional tax effects of the TCJA were recorded in connection with the one-time transition tax expense of $429.2 million, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a decrease in corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% of $62.3 million tax benefit. Exclusive of the enactment of the TCJA, the Company’s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate due to the impact of earnings from outside the U.S., mainly attributable to our share of the income of our JBC joint venture, a Free Zones company under the laws of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. In addition, income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, included foreign rate changes of $16.2 million and a $5.1 million out-of-period adjustment due to changes in our deferred tax liabilities for basis differences in Chilean fixed assets, partially offset by a $10.9 million benefit from the release of valuation allowances due to a foreign restructuring plan that was initiated during the second quarter of 2017 and a $8.8 million benefit from excess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation arrangements.
See Note 20, “Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate to our effective rate for 2018 and 2017.
Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Investments
Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was $89.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $84.5 million in the same period last year. This increase of $4.8 million was primarily due to higher equity income reported by our Lithium segment joint venture, Windfield Holdings Pty. Ltd., partially offset by a decrease in equity income in our Catalysts segment.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
For the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $45.6 million compared to $44.6 million in the same period of 2017. This increase of $1.0 million was primarily due to an increase in consolidated income related to our JBC joint venture from higher sales volumes in the current year.

Net Income Attributable to Albemarle Corporation
Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation increased to $693.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $54.9 million for the corresponding period of 2017. The increase is primarily due to the net impact to income tax expense of $366.9 million as a result of the enactment of the TCJA and a $52.8 million loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of senior notes recorded in 2017, as well as the after-tax gain of $169.9 million related to the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture in 2018. In addition, the increase was driven by favorable pricing impacts of $141.0 million and increased sales volumes in all reportable segments, reduced acquisition and integration, and restructuring and other costs in 2018. This was partially offset by $27.0 million of legal expenses related to products that Albemarle no longer manufactures and a previously disposed business, $16.2 million of charitable contributions beyond the Company’s ordinary, recurring charitable contributions, $15.6 million related to environmental charges related to a site formerly owned by Albemarle recorded in 2018 and a $6.2 million gain related to the acquisition of the 50% interest of an equity investment in 2017.
Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income, Net of Tax
Total other comprehensive loss, after income taxes, was $125.2 million in 2018 compared to $187.6 million in 2017. This change is primarily due to changes in foreign currency translations. We translate our foreign subsidiary financial statements from their local currencies to U.S. Dollars. In 2018, other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was $150.3 million, mainly as a result of unfavorable movements in the Euro of approximately $114 million, the Chinese Renminbi of approximately $14 million, the Brazilian Real of approximately $12 million, the Korean Won of approximately $5 million and a net unfavorable variance in various other currencies totaling approximately $5 million. Also included in total other comprehensive loss for 2018 is a gain of $25.8 million in connection with the revaluation of our Euro-based 1.875% Senior notes which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations. In 2017, other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation adjustments was $227.4 million, mainly as a result of favorable movements in the Euro of approximately $192 million, the Korean Won of approximately $16 million, the Chinese Renminbi of approximately $13 million and the Taiwan Dollar of approximately $4 million. Also included in total other comprehensive income for 2017 is a loss of $41.8 million in connection with the revaluation of our Euro-based 1.875% Senior notes which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations.
Segment Information Overview. We have identified three reportable segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of our products as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions. Our reportable business segments consist of: (1) Lithium, (2) Bromine Specialties and (3) Catalysts.
Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables. Results for 2017 have been recast to reflect the change in segments previously noted. The “All Other” category includes only the fine chemistry services business, that does not fit into any of our core businesses.
The Corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporate-related items not allocated to the operating segments. Pension and OPEB service cost (which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the reportable segments, All Other, and Corporate, whereas the remaining components of pension and OPEB benefits cost or credit (“Non-operating pension and OPEB items”) are included in Corporate. Segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker uses adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) to assess the ongoing performance of the Company’s business segments and to allocate resources. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-recurring or unusual items in a balanced manner and on a segment basis. These non-recurring or unusual items may include acquisition and integration related costs, utilization of inventory markup, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges, non-operating pension and OPEB items and other significant non-recurring items. In addition, management uses adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performance-based compensation for management and other employees. The Company has reported adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or any other financial measure reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Lithium
Lithium segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.23 billion, up $209.3 million, or 21%, compared to the corresponding period of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by $105.3 million of higher sales volumes largely in battery grade salts and specialty downstream products due to strong demand, $87.4 million of favorable pricing due to strong demand of our contracted customers for battery grade materials and $17.0 million of favorable currency translation resulting from the weaker U.S. Dollar against the Euro. Adjusted EBITDA for Lithium increased 19%, or $84.1 million, to $530.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period of 2017, primarily driven by favorable pricing due to strong demand, increases of approximately $33 million from higher volumes and $4.2 million of favorable currency translation. These increases were partially offset by approximately $30 million in higher price-related royalties and approximately $12 million of higher SG&A costs to support business growth.
Bromine Specialties
Bromine Specialties segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $917.9 million, up $62.7 million, or 7%, compared to the corresponding period of 2017. The increase was driven primarily by $36.9 million in favorable pricing due to continued constrained production of elemental bromine by Chinese bromine companies, $19.9 million in higher sales volumes in flame-retardants and other bromine derivatives due to continued strong demand, and $5.9 million of favorable currency translation resulting from the weaker U.S. Dollar against the Euro. Adjusted EBITDA for Bromine Specialties increased 11%, or $29.2 million, to $288.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period of 2017, primarily due to favorable pricing across most products, which was partially offset by higher raw material costs

38

--------------------------------------

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

of approximately $19 million. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was also due to $5.1 million of favorable currency translation related to the Euro, and higher sales volumes due to continued strong demand.
Catalysts
Catalysts segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.10 billion, an increase of $34.0 million, or 3%, compared to the corresponding period of 2017. This increase was primarily due to $83.5 million of higher sales volumes driven by refining catalyst products due to favorable mix in hydro-processing catalysts, $21.6 million of favorable pricing, mainly in CFT and FCC catalysts as a result of strong demand for transportation fuels, and $7.7 million of favorable currency translation resulting from the weaker U.S. Dollar against the Euro. These increases were partially offset by $78.9 million of net sales impact from Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture. Catalysts adjusted EBITDA increased $0.4 million, to $284.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the corresponding period of 2017. Strong volumes resulting in approximately $57 million of adjusted EBITDA, including the 2017 negative impact of hurricane Harvey of $13.8 million, were partially offset by $30.4 million of adjusted EBITDA impact from the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture. Favorable pricing of $21.6 million and partial insurance claim reimbursements of $4.2 million received in 2018 related to hurricane Harvey, were more than offset by higher raw material and utility costs, resulting in a net unfavorable impact of approximately $9 million.
All Other
All Other net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $127.2 million, a decrease of $1.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable pricing, partially offset by higher volumes for the fine chemistry services business. All Other adjusted EBITDA was up 2%, or $0.2 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 in comparison to the same period of 2017.
Corporate
Corporate adjusted EBITDA was a charge of $110.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $7.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to lower SG&A spend related to compensation related costs and professional fees.
Comparison of 2017 to 2016
Net Sales
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded net sales of $3.07 billion, a 15% increase compared to net sales of $2.68 billion for the corresponding period of 2016. Net sales increased due to $272.2 million of higher volumes, $157.8 million of favorable pricing impacts and $3.4 million of favorable currency exchange impacts, partially offset by the $38.6 million impact of the sale of the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business.
Gross Profit
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our gross profit increased $136.0 million, or 14%, compared to the corresponding period of 2016. Included in Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 are: (1) a $23.1 million charge related to the markup of inventory purchased as part of the acquisition of the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion business of Jiangli New Materials; (2) $14.3 million of acquisition and integration related costs resulting from the Jiangli New Materials acquisition; and (3) restructuring costs of $2.9 million related to a plan to reduce costs at several locations. In addition, gross profit decreased $3.1 million related to the divested minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business in the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of these items, gross profit increased by $179.4 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher overall sales volumes and favorable price impacts, partially offset by increased costs in Lithium and a $15.4 million negative impact from hurricane Harvey. Overall, these factors contributed to a gross profit margin for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 of 36.0% and 36.2%, respectively. Excluding the impact of the charges noted above, gross profit margin was 37.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 36.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our SG&A expenses increased $96.5 million, or 27%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. The year ended December 31, 2017 included $19.6 million of acquisition and integration related costs, primarily resulting from the acquisition of Jiangli New Materials, $8.4 million of restructuring costs related to several locations, primarily our Lithium sites in Germany and $3.3 million of multiemployer plan financial improvement plan shortfall contributions for our employees. Excluding the impact of these charges, SG&A expenses increased by $65.2 million, or 18%, primarily due to increased compensation costs, Lithium growth spending and professional fees, partially offset by savings from

39

--------------------------------------

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

our restructuring. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 14.7% in 2017, compared to 13.2% in 2016. Excluding the impact of these charges, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 13.6% in 2017 and 13.2% in 2016.
Research and Development Expenses
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our R&D expenses increased $3.9 million, or 5%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. Included in R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 are $5.7 million of restructuring costs related to our Lithium sites in Germany. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses were 2.7% in 2017, compared to 3.0% in 2016.
Gain on Sales of Businesses, Net
The year ended December 31, 2016 included gains before income taxes of $11.5 million and $112.3 million related to the sales of the metal sulfides business and the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business, respectively, both of which closed in the first quarter of 2016. In addition, Gain on sales of businesses, net, for the year ended December 31, 2016, included a loss of $1.5 million on the sale of our wafer reclaim business.
Acquisition and Integration Related Costs
Acquisition and integration related costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 are reported in Cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses, as noted above. The year ended December 31, 2016 included $52.1 million of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of Rockwood (mainly consisting of professional services, costs to achieve synergies, relocation costs, and other integration costs) and $5.3 million of costs in connection with other significant projects.
Interest and Financing Expenses
Interest and financing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $50.2 million to $115.4 million from the corresponding 2016 period, due mainly to a loss of $52.8 million on early extinguishment of debt related to the tender premiums, fees, unamortized discounts and unamortized deferred financing costs from the repayment of the 3.00% Senior notes in full, €307.0 million of the 1.875% Senior notes and $174.7 million of the 4.50% Senior notes.
Other Expenses, Net
Other expenses, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.5 million versus $20.5 million for the corresponding 2016 period. Other expenses, net for 2017 included approximately $16.1 million of pension and OPEB benefits (including mark-to-market actuarial gains of $11.4 million) allocated to Other expenses, net, as compared to $26.4 million of pension and OPEB costs (including mark-to-market actuarial losses of $26.7 million) allocated to Other expenses, net in 2016. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $28.7 million reserve recorded against a note receivable in one of our European entities no longer deemed probable of collection, $11.0 million of charges related to previously disposed properties or businesses, partially offset by a $10.6 million gain related to the reversal of liabilities recorded as part of purchase accounting from a previous acquisition, a $6.2 million gain related to the acquisition of the 50% interest of an equity investment and $1.1 million related to a reversal of a liability associated with the previous disposal of a property. The remaining change was primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange losses of $13.5 million and a $2.9 million gain in the fair value of our investment in private equity securities recorded during the third quarter of 2016.
The mark-to-market actuarial gain in 2017 is primarily attributable to a higher return on pension plan assets in 2017 than was expected, as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance. The weighted-average actual return on our U.S. and foreign pension plan assets was 14.31% versus an expected return of 6.73%. The mark-to-market actuarial gain in 2017 was partially offset by a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate to 4.03% from 4.43% for our U.S. pension plans and to 1.94% from 2.00% for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2017 measurement date.
The mark-to-market actuarial loss in 2016 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the weighted-average discount rate to 4.43% from 4.67% for our U.S. pension plans and to 2.00% from 2.76% for our foreign pension plans to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2016 measurement date. The mark-to-market actuarial loss in 2016 was partially offset by a higher return on pension plan assets in 2016 than was expected, as a result of overall market and investment portfolio performance. The weighted-average actual return on our U.S. and foreign pension plan assets was 8.11% versus an expected return of 6.85%.

Income Tax Expense
The effective income tax rate for 2017 was 96.6% compared to 18.7% for 2016. Our effective income tax rate for 2017 was primarily affected by the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. The tax effects of the TCJA are recorded in connection with the one-time transition tax expense of $429.2 million, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a decrease in corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% of $62.3 million tax benefit. Exclusive of the enactment of the TCJA, the Company’s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate due to the impact of earnings from outside the U.S., mainly attributable to our share of the income of our JBC joint venture, a Free Zones company under the laws of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. In addition, income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, included foreign rate changes of $16.2 million and a $5.1 million out-of-period adjustment due to changes in our deferred tax liabilities for basis differences in Chilean fixed assets offset by a $10.9 million benefit from the release of valuation allowances due to a foreign restructuring plan that was initiated during the second quarter of 2017 and a $8.8 million benefit from excess tax benefits realized from stock-based compensation arrangements.
Our effective tax rate for 2016 was affected by discrete net tax expense items of $20.2 million related mainly to a tax gain from restructuring the ownership of a foreign subsidiary, foreign tax rate changes, provision to return adjustments and changes in valuation allowances necessary due to the restructuring. See Note 20, “Income Taxes,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory income tax rate to our effective rate for 2017 and 2016.
Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Investments
Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was $84.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $59.6 million in the same period last year. This increase of $24.9 million was primarily due to higher equity income reported by our Lithium segment joint venture, Windfield Holdings Pty. Ltd., resulting from favorable pricing and volumes in our lithium business.
Income from Discontinued Operations (Net of Tax)
The year ended December 31, 2016 income from discontinued operations, after income taxes, of $202.1 million included a pre-tax gain of $388.0 million ($135.0 million after income taxes) related to the sale of our Chemetall Surface Treatment business, which closed on December 14, 2016. This gain represents the difference between the carrying value of the related assets and their fair value as determined by the sales price less estimated costs to sell, and included the reversal of $81.4 million of foreign currency translation loss out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests
For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $44.6 million compared to $37.1 million in the same period of 2016. This increase of $7.5 million was due primarily to changes in consolidated income related to our JBC joint venture resulting from higher sales volumes.
Net Income Attributable to Albemarle Corporation
Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation decreased to $54.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $643.7 million for the corresponding period of 2016. The year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by the one-time transition tax expense of $429.2 million recorded as a result of the enactment of the TCJA in December 2017. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $52.8 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and $17.1 million of restructuring and other costs, while the year ended December 31, 2016 included net gains of $250.5 million after income taxes related to the sale of businesses, including discontinued operations. Excluding these items, net income attributable to Albemarle increased by $160.8 million. The increase was primarily due to the increase in gross profit from higher overall sales volumes and favorable price impacts, the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a decrease in corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% of $62.3 million tax benefit resulting from the enactment of the TCJA, and lower acquisition and integration related costs, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses, income before taxes from discontinued operations in 2016 and the negative impact of hurricane Harvey.
Other Comprehensive Income, Net of Tax
Total other comprehensive income, after income taxes, was $187.6 million in 2017 compared to $8.3 million in 2016. This change is primarily due to changes in foreign currency translations. We translate our foreign subsidiary financial statements from their local currencies to U.S. Dollars. In 2017, other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation

adjustments was $227.4 million, mainly as a result of favorable movements in the Euro of approximately $192 million, the Korean Won of approximately $16 million, the Chinese Renminbi of approximately $13 million and the Taiwan Dollar of approximately $4 million. Also included in total other comprehensive income for 2017 is a loss of $41.8 million in connection with the revaluation of our Euro-based 1.875% Senior notes which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations. In 2016, other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was $20.8 million, mainly as a result of unfavorable movements in the British Pound Sterling of approximately $25 million, the Chinese Renminbi of approximately $12 million, the Korean Won of approximately $6 million, the Turkish Lira of approximately $6 million, partially offset by favorable movements in the Euro of approximately $15 million and the Brazilian Real of approximately $13 million. Included in the currency movements for 2016 is the favorable effect of $81.4 million in accumulated foreign currency translation losses that were reversed as a result of the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business. Also included in total other comprehensive income for 2016 is income of $26.1 million in connection with the revaluation of our Euro-based 1.875% Senior notes and which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations.

Lithium
Lithium segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.02 billion, up $350.0 million, or 52%, in comparison to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by $163.2 million of favorable Lithium sales volumes, largely from battery grade applications, due to market demand and $186.3 million of favorable Lithium price impacts due primarily to price increases in our battery grade lithium salts. Adjusted EBITDA for Lithium increased 56%, or $160.9 million, to $446.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to favorable pricing and higher overall sales volumes, partially offset by Lithium growth spending and $0.4 million of unfavorable currency translation impacts.
Bromine Specialties
Bromine Specialties segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $855.1 million, up $62.7 million, or 8%, compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The increase was driven primarily by $60.4 million of higher sales volumes due to strong demand in flame retardants and reduced production in 2017 by Chinese bromine companies, and $2.3 million of favorable pricing on certain bromine derivatives. Adjusted EBITDA for Bromine Specialties increased 14%, or $32.0 million, to $258.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to higher overall sales volumes and favorable pricing, partially offset by higher variable and fixed costs and a $1.5 million negative impact from hurricane Harvey.
Catalysts
Catalysts segment net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1.07 billion, an increase of $36.1 million, or 3%, compared to the corresponding period of 2016. This increase was primarily due to $48.7 million of higher volumes from strong demand in our customer base and $2.8 million of favorable currency exchange impacts, partially offset by $15.5 million of unfavorable price impacts due to customer and product mix and the bankruptcy filing of one of our customers. Catalysts adjusted EBITDA decreased 10%, or $32.7 million, to $283.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to unfavorable price and mix impacts, higher costs and a $13.8 million negative impact from hurricane Harvey, partially offset by $2.3 million of favorable currency translation impacts.
All Other
All Other net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $128.9 million, a decrease of $52.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of the sale of the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business of $38.6 million, as well as unfavorable fine chemistry services pricing impacts due to a contract formula change which did not impact earnings. All Other adjusted EBITDA was down 6%, or $0.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the same period of 2016. The year ended December 31, 2016 included the impact of the sale of the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business of $3.4 million and a $2.9 million gain in the fair value of our investment in private equity securities.

Corporate
Corporate adjusted EBITDA was a charge of $117.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $32.0 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increased compensation costs, professional fees and $13.5 million of unfavorable currency impacts.

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Estimates, Assumptions and Reclassifications
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of our financial statements.
Certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.
Property, Plant and Equipment. We assign the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based upon our internal engineering estimates which are reviewed periodically. The estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment range from two to sixty years and depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method, with the exception of our long-term mineral rights, which are depleted on a units-of-production method. We evaluate the recovery of our property, plant and equipment by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.
Acquisition Method of Accounting. We recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition for acquired businesses. Determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment, the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, market prices and tax rates, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the investee, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization expense. For more information on our acquisitions and application of the acquisition method, see Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Income Taxes. We assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings, and we estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions and indefinite investment assertions.
Environmental Remediation Liabilities. We estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site-specific facts and circumstances. Cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing (i) the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter, (ii) the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan and (iii) the extent of other parties’ share of responsibility.
Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services, and is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied under the terms of contracts with our customers. A performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied when control of the product or service is transferred to our customer. The transaction price of a contract, or the amount we expect to receive upon satisfaction of all performance obligations, is determined by reference to the contract’s terms and includes adjustments, if applicable, for any variable consideration, such as customer rebates, noncash consideration or consideration payable to the customer, although these adjustments are generally not material. Where a contract contains more than one distinct performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, although these situations do not occur frequently and are generally not built into our contracts. Any unsatisfied performance obligations are not material. Standalone selling prices are based on prices we charge to our customers, which in some cases is based on established market

45

--------------------------------------

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

prices. Sales and other similar taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue. Our payment terms are generally between 30 to 90 days, however, they vary by market factors, such as customer size, creditworthiness, geography and competitive environment.
All of our revenue is derived from contracts with customers, and almost all of our contracts with customers contain one performance obligation for the transfer of goods where such performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time. Control of a product is deemed to be transferred to the customer upon shipment or delivery. Significant portions of our sales are sold free on board shipping point or on an equivalent basis, while delivery terms of other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements. Our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale, order confirmation documents and invoices, while the timing between shipment and delivery generally ranges between 1 and 45 days. Costs for shipping and handling activities, whether performed before or after the customer obtains control of the goods, are accounted for as fulfillment costs.
The Company currently utilizes the following practical expedients, as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
• All sales and other pass-through taxes are excluded from contract value;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, no adjustment was necessary for contracts that did not cross over the reporting year;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We will not consider the possibility of a contract having a significant financing component (which would effectively attribute a portion of the sales price to interest income) unless, if at contract inception, the expected payment terms (from time of delivery or other relevant criterion) are more than one year;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• If our right to customer payment is directly related to the value of our completed performance, we recognize revenue consistent with the invoicing right; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We expense as incurred all costs of obtaining a contract incremental to any costs/compensation attributable to individual product sales/shipments for contracts where the amortization period for such costs would otherwise be one year or less.

Certain products we produce are made to our customer’s specifications where such products have no alternative use or would need significant rework costs in order to be sold to another customer. In management’s judgment, control of these arrangements is transferred to the customer at a point in time (upon shipment or delivery) and not over the time they are produced. Therefore revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery of these products.
Costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are not significant and are expensed immediately as the amortization period would be one year or less. When the Company incurs pre-production or other fulfillment costs in connection with an existing or specific anticipated contract and such costs are recoverable through margin or explicitly reimbursable, such costs are capitalized and amortized to Cost of goods sold on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, which is less than one year. We record bad debt expense in specific situations when we determine the customer is unable to meet its financial obligation.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with current accounting guidance which requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to not be amortized.
We test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by the business management. We estimate the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows. Future cash flows include assumptions about sales volumes, selling prices, raw material prices, labor and other employee benefit costs, capital additions, income taxes, working capital, and other economic or market-related factors. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables, and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. We perform a sensitivity analysis by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of these estimates being used in the goodwill impairment analysis. We use a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”) approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing. Our WACC calculation incorporates industry-weighted average returns on debt and equity from a market perspective. The factors in this calculation are largely external to the Company and, therefore, are beyond our control. We test our recorded goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2018 and concluded there was no

46

--------------------------------------

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

impairment as of that date. In addition, no material indications of impairment in any of our reporting units were indicated by the sensitivity analysis.
We assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets, which include trade names, for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment standard allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if we determine, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If we determine based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount.
Definite-lived intangible assets, such as purchased technology, patents and customer lists, are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally for periods ranging from five to twenty-five years. Except for customer lists and relationships associated with the majority of our Lithium business, which are amortized using the pattern of economic benefit method, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. We evaluate the recovery of our definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the net carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of that asset group when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the fair value of the asset group is measured and if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. See Note 12, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Resource Development Expenses
We incur costs in resource exploration, evaluation and development during the different phases of our resource development projects. Exploration costs incurred before obtaining legal rights to explore an area are generally expensed as incurred. After obtaining legal rights, exploration costs are expensed in areas where we have uncertainty about obtaining proven resources. In areas where we have substantial knowledge about the area and consider it probable to obtain commercially viable proven resources, exploration and evaluation costs are capitalized.
If technical feasibility studies have been obtained, resource evaluation expenses are capitalized when the study demonstrates proven or probable resources for which future economic returns are expected, while costs for projects that are not considered viable are expensed. Development costs that are necessary to bring the property to commercial production or increase the capacity or useful life are capitalized. Costs to maintain the production capacity in a property under production are expensed as incurred.
Capitalized resource costs are depleted using the units-of-production method. Our resource development assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits
Under authoritative accounting standards, assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As required, we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of our pension and OPEB plans equal to the plan’s funded status as of the measurement date. The primary assumptions are as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Discount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expected Return on Plan Assets—We project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets for these investments. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Rate of Compensation Increase—For salary-related plans, we project employees’ annual pay increases, which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement.

• Mortality Assumptions—Assumptions about life expectancy of plan participants are used in the measurement of related plan obligations.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognized annually in our consolidated statements of income in the fourth quarter and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year. The remaining components of pension and OPEB plan expense, primarily service cost, interest cost and expected return on assets, are recorded on a monthly basis. The market-related value of assets equals the actual market value as of the date of measurement.

During 2018, we made changes to assumptions related to discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets. We consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions.
Our U.S. defined benefit plans for non-represented employees are closed to new participants, with no additional benefits accruing under these plans as participants’ accrued benefits have been frozen. In selecting the discount rates for the U.S. plans, we consider expected benefit payments on a plan-by-plan basis. As a result, the Company uses different discount rates for each plan depending on the demographics of participants and the expected timing of benefit payments. For 2018, the discount rates were calculated using the results from a bond matching technique developed by Milliman, which matched the future estimated annual benefit payments of each respective plan against a portfolio of bonds of high quality to determine the discount rate. We believe our selected discount rates are determined using preferred methodology under authoritative accounting guidance and accurately reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2018 measurement date.
In selecting the discount rates for the foreign plans, we look at long-term yields on AA-rated corporate bonds when available. Our actuaries have developed yield curves based on the yields of constituent bonds in the various indices as well as on other market indicators such as swap rates, particularly at the longer durations. For the Eurozone, we apply the Aon Hewitt yield curve to projected cash flows from the relevant plans to derive the discount rate. For the U.K., the discount rate is determined by applying the Aon Hewitt yield curve for typical schemes of similar duration to projected cash flows of Albemarle’s U.K. plan. In other countries where there is not a sufficiently deep market of high-quality corporate bonds, we set the discount rate by referencing the yield on government bonds of an appropriate duration.
At December 31, 2018, the weighted-average discount rate for the U.S. and foreign pension plans was increased to 4.59% and 2.15%, respectively, from 4.03% and 1.94%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 to reflect market conditions as of the December 31, 2018 measurement date. The discount rate for the OPEB plans at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 4.55% and 3.99%, respectively.
In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocations of plan assets to these investments. For the years 2018 and 2017, the weighted-average expected rate of return on U.S. pension plan assets was 6.89%, and the weighted-average expected rate of return on foreign pension plan assets was 5.52% and 6.16%, respectively. Effective January 1, 2019, the weighted-average expected rate of return on U.S. and foreign pension plan assets is 6.89% and 5.69%, respectively. The weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our OPEB plans was 7.00% during 2018 and 2017.
In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the assumed weighted-average rate of compensation increase was 3.63% and 3.18%, respectively, for our foreign pension plans.
In October 2017, the Society of Actuaries (“SOA”) published an updated Mortality Improvement Scale, MP-2017. The updated improvement scale incorporates an additional year of mortality data (2015). We utilized the same base, SOA RP-2014 Adjusted to 2006 Total Dataset Mortality, but we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate the MP-2017 Mortality Improvement Scale for purposes of measuring our U.S. pension and OPEB obligations at December 31, 2017. In October 2018, the SOA published an updated Mortality Improvement Scale, MP-2018. The updated Improvement Scale incorporates an additional year of mortality data (2016). We utilized the same base mortality, SOA RP-2014 Adjusted to 2006 Total Dataset Mortality, but we revised our mortality assumption to incorporate the MP-2018 Mortality Improvement Scale for purposes of measuring our U.S. pension and OPEB obligations at December 31, 2018.
At December 31, 2018, the assumed rate of increase in the pre-65 and post-65 per capita cost of covered health care benefits for U.S. retirees was zero as the employer-paid premium caps (pre-65 and post-65) were met starting January 1, 2013.

A variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued OPEB liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and OPEB cost. The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions, primarily in the U.S. (in thousands):

------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- ------- ---------------------------------- - ---------------------------------------- ----- ---------------------------------- - - ------- - ----- - ------ -

 (Favorable) Unfavorable
 1% Increase 1% Decrease
 Increase (Decrease)in Benefit Obligation Increase (Decrease)in Benefit Cost Increase (Decrease)in Benefit Obligation Increase (Decrease)in Benefit Cost
Actuarial Assumptions
Discount Rate:
Pension $ (94,999 ) $ 3,492 $ 116,592 $ (5,024 )
Other postretirement benefits $ (4,403 ) $ 239 $ 5,226 $ (298 )
Expected return on plan assets:
Pension * $ (5,595 ) * $ 5,595
Other postretirement benefits * $ — * $ —

* Not applicable.
Of the $583.7 million total pension and postretirement assets at December 31, 2018, $72.0 million, or approximately 12%, are measured using the net asset value as a practical expedient. Gains or losses attributable to these assets are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as either an increase or decrease in plan assets. See Note 15, “Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Income Taxes
We use the liability method for determining our income taxes, under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates. Under this method, the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. In order to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, we are following guidance under ASU 2015-17, which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet, along with any related valuation allowance. Tax effects are released from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item.
Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses, capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers. A valuation allowance, reducing deferred tax assets, is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character. Although realization is not assured, we do not establish a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that a net deferred tax asset will be realized.
We only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. Once the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be realized. Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in Income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income.
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to the statute of limitations, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audits by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for years prior to 2011. Due to the statute of limitations, we also are no longer subject to U.S. state income tax audits prior to 2011.
 With respect to jurisdictions outside the U.S., several audits are in process. We have audits ongoing for the years 2006 through 2017 related to Germany, Taiwan, Italy, India, Belgium, and Chile, some of which are for entities that have since been divested.
While we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on federal and foreign tax-related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.

49

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

Since the timing of resolutions and/or closure of tax audits are uncertain, it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability related to uncertain tax positions that may occur within the next twelve months. Our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability related to uncertain tax positions, relating to a number of issues, up to approximately $4.4 million as a result of closure of tax statutes. As a result of the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business in 2016, we agreed to indemnify certain income and non-income tax liabilities, including uncertain tax positions, associated with the entities sold. The associated liability is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities. See Note 16, “Other Noncurrent Liabilities,” and Note 20, “Income Taxes,” for further details.
We have designated the undistributed earnings of a portion of our foreign operations as indefinitely reinvested and as a result we do not provide for deferred income taxes on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries. Our foreign earnings are computed under U.S. federal tax earnings and profits (“E&P”) principles. In general, to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these E&P amounts, deferred taxes have not been provided, as they are essentially permanent in duration. The determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable. We provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be indefinitely invested. We will continue to evaluate our permanent investment assertion taking into consideration all relevant and current tax laws.
On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law in the U.S. The TCJA contains several key tax provisions including, among other things, the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, the requirement of companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and the creation of new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings such as global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”).  A company can elect an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period charge in the future period the tax arises or as part of deferred taxes related to the investment or subsidiary.  The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost.
Stock-based Compensation Expense
The fair value of restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards with a service condition are determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, and the fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The fair value of performance unit awards with a service and a market condition are estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of these awards is determined after giving effect to estimated forfeitures. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant. To the extent restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses.

Financial Condition and Liquidity
Overview
The principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments and resource development costs, funding working capital and service of debt. We also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock. Historically, cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations, debt financing and equity issuances.
We are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory. We anticipate that cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund capital expenditures and other investing activities, fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future.
Cash Flow
Our cash and cash equivalents were $555.3 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $1.14 billion at December 31, 2017. Cash provided by operating activities was $546.2 million, $304.0 million and $735.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2018 versus 2017 was primarily due to higher income tax payments in 2017, including approximately $257 million of income taxes from the gain on sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business. In addition, 2018 benefited from increased earnings in each of our reportable segments, increased dividends received from unconsolidated investments and lower interest payments. This was partially offset by increased

50

--------------------------------------

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

receivables from higher net sales during 2018 and the build-up of inventory in our Lithium and Catalysts segments due to higher forecasted sales. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 versus 2016 was primarily due to the 2017 income tax payment noted above that was recorded in income taxes payable in 2016. In addition, the decrease resulted from the build-up of inventory in the Lithium reportable segment in 2017. This was partially offset by increased overall sales volumes and prices, lower acquisition and integration related costs and lower interest payments in 2017 as compared to 2016.
During 2018, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and $413.6 million of net proceeds from divestitures funded $114.7 million of commercial paper repayments, net of borrowings, $500.0 million of accelerated share repurchase programs, $700.0 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, and mining resource development, dividends to shareholders of $144.6 million, and pension and postretirement contributions of $15.2 million. During 2017, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and net borrowings of $138.8 million funded $778.2 million of debt repayments, $317.7 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, a $250.0 million accelerated share repurchase program, dividends to shareholders of $140.6 million, and pension and postretirement contributions of $13.3 million. During 2016, cash on hand, cash provided by operations and $3.33 billion of cash proceeds from divestitures funded $1.42 billion of debt repayments, $196.7 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, dividends to shareholders of $135.4 million, and pension and postretirement contributions of $20.1 million. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our consolidated joint venture, JBC, paid dividends of approximately $40.0 million, $102.5 million and $105.0 million, respectively, which resulted in dividends to noncontrolling interests of $14.8 million, $36.8 million and $35.9 million, respectively.
On April 3, 2018, we completed the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture to W.R. Grace & Co. for net cash proceeds of approximately $413.6 million and recorded a gain of $210.4 million before income taxes in 2018 related to the sale of this business. The transaction includes Albemarle’s Product Development Center located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and operations at our Yeosu, South Korea site. The sale did not include the organometallics or curatives portion of the PCS business. The Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture reflects our commitment to investing in the future growth of our high priority businesses and returning capital to our shareholders.
On December 14, 2016, we completed the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF SE for cash proceeds of approximately $3.1 billion, net of purchase price adjustments. As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain of $388.0 million before income taxes and a tax liability of $253.0 million related to the difference between the sales price and the proportionate carrying value of the interests sold in 2016. We used the proceeds to significantly reduce leverage, including repaying the outstanding balance of the September 2015 Term Loan in full and approximately $153 million of Commercial Paper Notes in December 2016. In addition, during the first quarter of 2017, we repaid the 3.00% Senior notes in full, €307.0 million of the 1.875% Senior notes and $174.7 million of the 4.50% Senior notes, as well as related redemption premiums of $45.2 million.
In 2016, we also completed the sales of our metal sulfides business and our mineral-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses for net proceeds of approximately $137 million and $187 million, respectively. The net proceeds from both sales were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the September 2015 Term Loan Agreement.
Capital expenditures were $700.0 million, $317.7 million and $196.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were incurred mainly for plant, machinery and equipment, and mining resource development. The increase in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by expansion in our Lithium business. Capital expenditures for discontinued operations were $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect our capital expenditures to be between $800 million and $900 million in 2019 for Lithium growth, mining resource development and capacity increases, as well as productivity and continuity of operations projects in all segments. Of the total capital expenditures, our projects related to the continuity of operations is expected to remain in the range of 4-6% of net sales, similar to prior years.
During 2018, we incurred $19.4 million of acquisition and integration related costs related to various significant projects. During 2017, we incurred $33.9 million of acquisition and integration related costs related to various significant projects, including the Jiangli New Materials acquisition, which contains non-routine compensation related costs negotiated specifically as a result of this acquisition that are outside of the Company’s ordinary course compensation arrangements. During 2016, we incurred $52.1 million of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of Rockwood (mainly consisting of professional services, costs to achieve synergies, relocation costs, and other integration costs) and $5.3 million of costs in connection with other significant projects.
In November 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the number of shares the Company is permitted to repurchase under our share repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company was permitted to repurchase up to a maximum

51

--------------------------------------

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

of 15,000,000 shares, including those previously authorized but not yet repurchased. Under our existing Board authorized share repurchase program, during 2018 and 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares and 2.3 million shares of our common stock, respectively, which reduced the Company’s weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. All of the shares repurchased in 2018 and 2017 were also repurchased pursuant to the terms of ASR agreements with major financial institutions. As of December 31, 2018, there were 7,396,263 remaining shares available for repurchase under the Company’s authorized share repurchase program. There were no shares of our common stock repurchased during 2016.
Net current assets decreased to approximately $815.2 million at December 31, 2018 from $1.28 billion at December 31, 2017, with the decrease being largely due to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents to fund the ASR programs we entered into during 2018 and capital expenditure projects. Additional changes in the components of net current assets are primarily due to the timing of the sale of goods and other ordinary transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the Company, and do not reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the ordinary course of business.
On February 26, 2019, we increased our quarterly dividend rate to $0.3675 per share, a 10% increase from the quarterly rate of $0.335 per share paid in 2018.
At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents included $525.8 million and $1.10 billion, respectively, held by our foreign subsidiaries. The majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely reinvested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, research, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations. From time to time, we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends, but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely reinvested or whose earnings qualify as “previously taxed income” as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we repatriated approximately $621.8 million, $20.5 million and $53.7 million of cash, respectively, as part of these foreign earnings cash repatriation activities. A portion of the cash repatriations was used to repay a net amount of $114.7 million of commercial paper during 2018.
While we continue to closely monitor our cash generation, working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy, we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions, share repurchases and other cash outlays, should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand, with additional cash needed, if any, provided by borrowings. The amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements.
Long-Term Debt
We currently have the following senior notes outstanding:

---------------- ----------------------- ------------- ---------------------- ----------- ---------------- -----------------

Issue Month/Year Principal (in millions) Interest Rate Interest Payment Dates Maturity Date
December 2014 €393.0 1.875% December 8 December 8, 2021
November 2014 $425.0 4.15% June 1 December 1 December 1, 2024
November 2014 $350.0 5.45% June 1 December 1 December 1, 2044
December 2010 $175.3 4.50% June 15 December 15 December 15, 2020

Our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding. The senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each senior note outstanding has terms that allow us to redeem the notes before its maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis using the comparable government rate (as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes) plus between 25 and 40 basis points, depending on the note, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101% upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. The senior notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of $40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default.

Albemarle Corporation and Subsidiaries

On June 21, 2018, we entered into the 2018 Credit Agreement to replace our revolving, unsecured credit agreement dated as of February 7, 2014, as amended. The 2018 Credit Agreement currently provides for borrowings of up to $1.0 billion and matures on June 23, 2023. Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates based on an average London inter-bank offered rate (“LIBOR”) for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 0.910% to 1.500%, depending on the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Services and Fitch Ratings. The applicable margin on the facility was 1.125% as of December 31, 2018. There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018.
Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement are conditioned upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent, including the absence of defaults. The Company is subject to one financial covenant, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. The financial covenant requires that the Company’s consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio (as such terms are defined in the 2018 Credit Agreement) to be less than or equal to 3.50:1.00, subject to adjustments in accordance with the terms of the 2018 Credit Agreement relating to a consummation of an acquisition where the consideration includes cash proceeds from issuance of funded debt in excess of $500 million. The 2018 Credit Agreement also contains customary default provisions, including defaults for non-payment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, non-performance of covenants and cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. The occurrence of an event of default under the 2018 Credit Agreement could result in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the credit facility being terminated.
On May 29, 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “Commercial Paper Notes”) from time-to-time up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of $750.0 million. The proceeds from the issuance of the Commercial Paper Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt of the Company. Our 2018 Credit Agreement is available to repay the Commercial Paper Notes, if necessary. Aggregate borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Credit Agreement and the Commercial Paper Notes will not exceed the $1.0 billion current maximum amount available under the 2018 Credit Agreement. The Commercial Paper Notes will be sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations, warranties, default and indemnification provisions. At December 31, 2018, we had $306.6 million of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding bearing a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 2.91% and a weighted-average maturity of 38 days. During 2018, we repaid a net amount of $114.7 million of commercial paper notes using cash on hand. The Commercial Paper Notes are classified as Current portion of long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
The non-current portion of our long-term debt amounted to $1.40 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $1.42 billion at December 31, 2017. In addition, at December 31, 2018, we had the ability to borrow $693.4 million under our commercial paper program and the 2018 Credit Agreement, and $251.0 million under other existing lines of credit, subject to various financial covenants under our 2018 Credit Agreement. We have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the 2018 Credit Agreement, as applicable. Therefore, the amounts outstanding under those credit lines, if any, are classified as long-term debt. We believe that as of December 31, 2018 we were, and currently are, in compliance with all of our debt covenants. For additional information about our long-term debt obligations, see Note 14, “Long-Term Debt,” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, including bank guarantees and letters of credit, which totaled approximately $71.8 million at December 31, 2018. None of these off-balance sheet arrangements has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

(c) These amounts primarily relate to contracts entered into with certain third party vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes. In order to secure materials, sometimes for long durations, these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) In December 2017, the TCJA was signed into law imposing a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings, payable over an eight-year period. The one-time transition tax imposed by the TCJA is based on our total post-1986 earnings and profits that we previously deferred from U.S. income taxes.

Amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions. Contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans, including our supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”), are expected to approximate $12 million in 2019. We may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount. We made contributions of approximately $12.9 million to our domestic and foreign pension plans (both qualified and nonqualified) during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The liability related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities totaled $22.9 million and $24.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in Other assets totaled $13.0 million and $14.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time.
Liquidity Outlook
We anticipate that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities, divestitures, including the Polyolefin Catalysts Divestiture, and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases, make acquisitions, make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Our main focus over the next three years, in terms of uses of cash, will be investing in growth of the businesses and the return of value to shareholders. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets, which may require additional liquidity. For example, we expect that the purchase price for the announced acquisition of the Wodgina Project, of approximately $1.15 billion, will be funded with available cash and new debt borrowings.
Our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability.
While we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions, an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments, decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit, not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing. While the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong, periods of elevated uncertainty related to global economic and/or geopolitical concerns may limit

efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time. If such concerns heighten, we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature. When the U.S. Federal Reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response, for example, to improving economic conditions, we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities, as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations, although these cost increases would be partially offset by increased income rates on portions of our cash deposits.
Overall, with generally strong cash-generative businesses and no significant long-term debt maturities before 2020, we believe we have, and will maintain, a solid liquidity position.
As previously reported in 2018, following receipt of information regarding potential improper payments being made by third party sales representatives of our Refining Solutions business, within our Catalysts segment, we promptly retained outside counsel and forensic accountants to investigate potential violations of the Company’s Code of Conduct, the FCPA, and other potentially applicable laws. Based on this internal investigation, we have voluntarily self-reported potential issues relating to the use of third party sales representatives in our Refining Solutions business, within our Catalysts segment, to the DOJ, the SEC, and the DPP, and are cooperating with the DOJ, the SEC, and DPP in their review of these matters. In connection with our internal investigation, we have implemented, and are continuing to implement, appropriate remedial measures.
At this time, we are unable to predict the duration, scope, result or related costs associated with the investigations by the DOJ, the SEC, or DPP. We are unable to predict what, if any, action may be taken by the DOJ, the SEC, or DPP, or what penalties or remedial actions they may seek to impose. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, disgorgement, equitable relief, or other losses. We do not believe, however, that any such fines, penalties, disgorgement, equitable relief or other losses would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.
We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $555.3 million as of December 31, 2018, of which $525.8 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. This cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in bank accounts or money market investments with no limitations on access. The cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is intended for use outside of the U.S. We anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the U.S. in excess of our cash held in the U.S. can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing U.S. credit facilities or our commercial paper program.

Safety and Environmental Matters
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements regulating the handling, manufacture and use of materials (some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies), the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. To our knowledge, we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws, regulations, statutes and ordinances. Compliance with existing federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position, but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a PRP, and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites. Management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a PRP, our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis. Further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled. In de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a PRP, except for remote contingencies. In other than de minimis PRP matters, our records indicate that unresolved PRP exposures should be immaterial. We accrue and expense our proportionate share of PRP costs. Because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters, we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved PRP sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.
Our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were $42.9 million, $40.1 million and $34.4 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures, and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years. Costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities, which at December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $49.6 million, an increase of $9.8 million from $39.8 million at December 31, 2017. See Note 17, “Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a reconciliation of our environmental liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

We believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis, although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period.
Capital expenditures for pollution-abatement and safety projects, including such costs that are included in other projects, were approximately $47.3 million, $28.1 million and $28.8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the future, capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals. Management’s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution-abatement and safety regulations are subject to (a) the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations and (b) uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful, or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary.

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. CSX's investment of $943 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as investment in Conrail. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2019 $ 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 2023 27 Thereafter 20 Total $ 155 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $343 million as of December 2018. The following table discloses amounts related to Conrail. Purchase price amortization and equity earnings are included in equity earnings of affiliates and all other ...

(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2  For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2019, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...
