Company Overview
Description of the Company and Business Segments

Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. The Company's organizational structure is based upon three principal business segments, BD Medical (“Medical”), BD Life Sciences (“Life Sciences”) and BD Interventional (“Interventional”).

BD’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. Our products are marketed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. We organize our operations outside the United States as follows: Europe; EMA (which includes the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Oceania region); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America); and Canada. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include the following geographic regions: Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and certain countries within Greater Asia. We are primarily focused on certain countries whose healthcare systems are expanding.
Strategic Objectives
BD remains focused on delivering sustainable growth and shareholder value, while making appropriate investments for the future. BD management operates the business consistent with the following core strategies:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• To increase revenue growth by focusing on our core products, services and solutions that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
• To supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• To continue investment in research and development for platform extensions and innovative new products;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• To make investments in growing our operations in emerging markets;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• To improve operating effectiveness and balance sheet productivity;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Improving clinical outcomes through new, more accurate and faster diagnostics;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Providing tools and technologies to the research community that facilitate the understanding of the cell, cellular diagnostics, cell therapy and immunology;

- --------------------------------------------------------
• Enhancing disease management with our product offerings.

We continue to strive to improve the efficiency of our capital structure and follow these guiding principles:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
• To operate the Company consistent with an investment grade credit profile;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
• To ensure access to the debt market for strategic opportunities;

- -----------------------------------------------------------
• To optimize the cost of capital based on market conditions.

In assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as BD’s financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews quarterly forecast data, monthly actual results, segment sales and

other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows.
Summary of Financial Results
Worldwide revenues in 2019 of $17.290 billion increased 8.2% from the prior-year period. The increase reflected a favorable impact of approximately 6% resulting from the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Bard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 but not in the first quarter of the prior-year period as operating activities of the business, which was acquired on December 29, 2017, were not included in our consolidated results of operations until January 1, 2018. Revenues in 2019 also reflected an unfavorable impact of almost 1% attributable to the Biosciences unit's divestiture of its Advanced Bioprocessing business at the end of October 2018, as is further discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  Revenue growth in 2019 additionally reflected volume growth of approximately 5.4%, an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2.3% and an unfavorable impact of price of approximately 0.3%. Volume growth in 2019 was as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Medical segment growth was driven by sales growth in all of the segment's units, particularly by growth in the Medication Management Solutions, Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Life Sciences segment growth reflected growth in all of the segment's units, particularly in the Biosciences unit.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interventional segment growth reflected sales growth in all units, particularly in the Surgery unit and the Urology and Critical Care unit.

We continue to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product market programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including geographical expansion), develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. While the economic environment for the healthcare industry and healthcare utilization in the United States is generally stable, destabilization in the future could adversely impact our businesses. Additionally, macroeconomic challenges in Europe continue to constrain healthcare utilization, although we currently view the environment as stable. In emerging markets, the Company’s growth is dependent primarily on government funding for healthcare systems. In addition, pricing pressure exists globally which could adversely impact our businesses.
Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operating activities totaling $3.330 billion in 2019. At September 30, 2019, we had $620 million in cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash. We continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends. During fiscal year 2019, we paid cash dividends of $984 million, including $832 million paid to common shareholders and $152 million paid to preferred shareholders.

Each reporting period, we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period. A stronger U.S. dollar in 2019, compared with 2018, resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues and earnings during 2019.  We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Foreign currency-neutral ("FXN") information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a foreign currency-neutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Results on a foreign currency-neutral basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled

Total Medical revenues $ 9,064 $ 8,616 $ 7,419 5.2 % (2.3 )% 7.5 % 16.1 % 2.1 % 14.0 %

The Medical segment's revenues in 2019 were favorably impacted by the inclusion of revenues associated with certain Bard products within the Medication Delivery Solutions unit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, as noted above, and also reflected strong growth in this unit's global sales of vascular access devices. The Medication Management Solutions unit's revenues in 2019 reflected sales growth attributable to the installations of infusion and dispensing systems, as well as growth in sales of disposables. The Pharmaceutical Systems unit's 2019 revenue growth was driven by sales of prefillable products and self-injection systems. Strength in the Diabetes Care unit's sales of pen needles in emerging markets was partially offset by lower growth in U.S. sales.
Medical segment revenue growth in 2018 was favorably impacted by the inclusion of revenues associated with certain Bard products within the Medication Delivery Solutions unit, beginning on January 1, 2018, as noted above. The Medical segment's underlying revenue growth was largely driven by sales of the Medication Delivery Solutions unit's vascular access and vascular care products as well as by the Medication Management Solutions unit's installations of dispensing and infusion systems.  Revenue growth in the Medication Management Solutions unit was partially offset by the unfavorable impact, in the first half of 2018, of a modification to dispensing equipment lease contracts with customers, which took place in April 2017. As a result of the lease modification, substantially all new lease contracts are accounted for as operating leases with revenue recognized over the agreement term, rather than upon the placement of capital.  The Medical segment’s underlying growth also reflected sales of the Pharmaceutical Systems unit's prefillable products and the Diabetes Care unit's pen needles.
Medical segment operating income was as follows:

------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - - -----

(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018 2017
Medical segment operating income (a) $ 2,824 $ 2,624 $ 1,907

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Operating income in 2019 and 2018 excluded certain general and administrative costs, which were allocated to the segment in 2017, due to a change in our management reporting approach, as is further discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The Medical segment's operating income was driven by improved gross profit margin and operating expense performance in 2019 and 2018 as discussed in greater detail below:

Table of Contents

•The Medical segment's gross profit margin in 2019 was higher as compared with 2018 primarily due to lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects which enhanced the efficiency of our operations. Additionally, the comparison of gross profit margin in 2019 with gross profit margin in 2018 reflected the unfavorable impacts in 2018 of a fair value step-up adjustment relating to Bard's inventory on the acquisition date and charges to write down the value of fixed assets, primarily in the Diabetes Care unit. These favorable impacts to the Medical segment's gross margin in 2019 were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation, higher raw material costs and pricing pressures. The Medical segment's gross profit margin in 2018 was lower as compared with 2017 primarily due to the expense related to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Bard transaction as well as the impact of the fair value step-up adjustment and write-down charges noted above. The Medical segment's gross profit margin in 2018 was also unfavorably impacted by higher raw material costs and pricing pressures. These unfavorable impacts to the Medical segment's gross margin were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects which enhanced the efficiency of our operations and favorable product mix impact relating to the Bard products reported within the segment.
•Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 was relatively flat compared with 2018. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2018 was lower compared with 2017 which primarily reflected a reduction in the general and administrative costs allocated to the segment, as noted above.
•Research and development expense as a percentage of revenues was lower in 2019 due to recent completion of projects and the timing of project spending. Research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2018 was higher compared with 2017 which reflected increased investment in new products and platforms.
Life Sciences Segment

Total Life Sciences revenues $ 4,300 $ 4,330 $ 3,988 (0.7 )% (2.6 )% 1.9 % 8.6 % 1.8 % 6.8 %

The Life Sciences segment's revenues in 2019 reflected continued strength in sales of the Preanalytical Systems unit's sales of core products in emerging markets. The Diagnostic Systems unit's 2019 revenues reflected growth in its BD MAXTM molecular platform as well as growth in sales of core microbiology products. This sales growth in the Diagnostic Systems unit was partially offset by an unfavorable comparison of the unit's U.S. revenues in 2019 to revenues in 2018, as the prior-year period benefited from a more severe influenza season. Revenues in the Biosciences unit in 2019 reflected growth in research reagent sales, as well as growth in U.S. research instrument sales, but were unfavorably impacted by the divestiture of the Advanced Bioprocessing business, as previously discussed. The Biosciences unit's results for 2018 and 2017 included revenues associated with the Advanced Bioprocessing business of $106 million and $103 million, respectively.
The Life Sciences segment's 2018 revenues was driven by growth across all three of its organizational units. The Diagnostic Systems unit's revenues were primarily driven by sales of core microbiology products as well as continued strength in sales of the unit's BD MAXTM molecular platform. Revenue growth in the Diagnostic Systems unit also reflected a more severe influenza season in 2018 compared with 2017. The Life Sciences segment's 2018 revenue growth was also driven by the Biosciences unit's sales of research reagents and recently launched instruments. Growth in the Preanalytical Systems unit reflected global sales of core products.

Table of Contents

Interventional segment revenues in 2019 also reflected growth in the Urology and Critical Care unit's sales of acute urology products and sales by the unit's home care and targeted temperature management businesses. Fiscal year 2019 revenues in the Surgery unit reflected growth in sales of the unit's biosurgery and infection prevention products. The Peripheral Intervention unit's 2019 revenues reflected growth in emerging market sales. This growth was partially offset by an unfavorable impact related to a letter issued in March 2019 by the FDA to healthcare professionals regarding the use of paclitaxel-coated devices in the treatment of peripheral artery disease, which impacted sales of our drug-coated balloon products. The extent and duration of the impact from the FDA letter on the Peripheral Intervention unit’s future revenues is difficult to predict.

(a) The amount presented in 2017 is associated with certain product offerings that were moved from the Medical segment to the Interventional segment in order to align with the reportable segment structure that became effective beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.

The Interventional segment's operating income was driven by its performance with respect to gross profit margin and operating expenses in 2019 as discussed in greater detail below:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gross profit margin was higher in 2019 as compared with 2018 primarily due to the unfavorable prior-year impact of recognizing a fair value step-up adjustment relating to Bard's inventory on the acquisition date and lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects, which enhanced the efficiency of our operations, and synergy initiatives. These favorable impacts to the Interventional segment's gross margin were partially offset by unfavorable product mix and unfavorable foreign currency translation.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 was relatively flat compared with 2018.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Research and development expense as a percentage of revenues was higher in 2019 as compared with 2018 primarily due to the Surgery unit's recognition of a write-down in the current-year period, as further discussed below.

The Interventional segment's operating income in 2018 reflected expense related to the recognition of a fair value step-up adjustment relating to Bard's inventory on the acquisition date. The fair value adjustment was a required non-cash adjustment to the value of acquired inventory and was expensed over a four-month period, consistent with an estimate of the period of time to sell the acquired inventory.
Geographic Revenues

(i) The amounts in 2019 and 2018 included additional tax (benefit) expense, net, of $(50) million and $640 million, respectively relating to new U.S. tax legislation which is further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Gross Profit Margin
The comparison of gross profit margins in 2019 and 2018 and the comparison of gross profit margins in 2018 and 2017 reflected the following impacts:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- -- ---- ---- --

 2019 2018
Gross profit margin % prior-year period 45.5 % 49.3 %
Impact of purchase accounting adjustments, asset write-downs and other specified items 2.9 % (6.9 )%
Operating performance 0.1 % 2.7 %
Foreign currency translation (0.6 )% 0.4 %
Gross profit margin % current-year period 47.9 % 45.5 %

The impact of purchase accounting adjustments and other specified items in 2019 was favorable due to a comparison to 2018, which included the recognition of fair value step-up adjustments relating to Bard's inventory on the acquisition date, as well as write-downs of certain assets in the Biosciences and Diabetes Care units in 2018 as further discussed above. The operating performance impacts in 2019 and 2018 reflected lower manufacturing costs resulting from the continuous improvement projects and synergy initiatives, as well as the favorable impact of Bard on product mix. Operating performance in 2019 was unfavorably impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable product mix. Higher raw material costs as well as pricing pressures unfavorably impacted operating performance in 2018.

Operating Expenses
Operating expenses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ----------------------------------- - ------------- ----- - --- -

 Increase (decrease) in basis points
(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018 2017 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017
Selling and administrative expense $ 4,332 $ 4,016 $ 2,909
% of revenues 25.1 % 25.1 % 24.1 % — 100

Research and development expense $ 1,062 $ 1,004 $ 770
% of revenues 6.1 % 6.3 % 6.4 % (20 ) (10 )

Acquisitions and other restructurings $ 480 $ 740 $ 354

Other operating expense, net $ 654 $ — $ 410

Selling and administrative
Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 was flat compared with 2018 as higher revenues and the achievement of cost synergies offset the impact of higher selling and general administrative costs attributable to Bard, which had a higher selling and administrative spending profile than BD, in our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, as noted above. The increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2018 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of Bard in 2018 results beginning on January 1, 2018.
Research and development

Research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2019 and 2018 was relatively flat compared with the prior-year periods. Spending in 2019, 2018 and 2017 reflected our continued commitment to invest in new products and platforms. As further discussed above, expenses in 2019 included certain write-down charges in the Surgery unit and expenses in 2018 included write-down charges in the Biosciences unit.
Acquisitions and other restructurings

Costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings in 2019 largely represented integration and restructuring costs incurred due to our acquisition of Bard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings in 2018 included restructuring, integration and transaction costs incurred due to our acquisition of Bard as well as integration and restructuring costs related to our fiscal year 2015 CareFusion acquisition and portfolio rationalization initiatives. Transaction costs incurred in 2017 primarily related to our acquisition of Bard. Substantially all of the integration and restructuring costs in 2017 were attributable to the CareFusion acquisition and portfolio rationalization initiatives.  For further disclosures regarding the costs relating to acquisitions and other restructurings, refer to Notes 10, 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Other operating expense, net

Other operating expense in 2019 included charges of approximately $914 million relating to certain product liability matters, as well as an estimated cost of $75 million relating to a product recall in the Medical segment. Net other operating expense in 2019 additionally included the pre-tax gain of $336 million recognized on BD's sale of its Advanced Bioprocessing business. Additional disclosures regarding the product liability matters and divestiture transaction are provided in Notes 5 and 11, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Other operating expense in 2017 included the $748 million non-cash charge resulting from the modification to our dispensing equipment lease contracts with customers. Additional disclosures regarding this lease contract modification are provided in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8.

Net Interest Expense

--------------------- ---- ---- ---- -- ---- ---- -- - ---- -

(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018 2017
Interest expense $ (639 ) $ (706 ) $ (521 )
Interest income 12 65 76
Net interest expense $ (627 ) $ (641 ) $ (445 )

The decrease in interest expense in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily reflected higher fees incurred in 2018 to draw from our term loan facility, which is further discussed below. Interest expense in 2019 was also favorably impacted by debt repayments during the current year, as well as lower overall interest rates on debt outstanding during the current-year period as a result of refinancing activities. The increase in interest expense in 2018 compared with 2017 reflected higher levels of debt for the full-year period due to our issuances of senior unsecured U.S. notes during the third quarter of 2017. Additional disclosures regarding our financing arrangements and debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The decrease in interest income in 2019 compared with 2018 reflected higher levels of cash on hand in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 in anticipation of closing the Bard acquisition at the end of the quarter. The decrease in interest income in 2018 compared with 2017 reflected lower cash levels in the remaining quarters of 2018, subsequent to the closing of the Bard acquisition.
Income Taxes

The income tax rates in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------ ------ -- ---- ----- ---- ------ --

 2019 2018 2017
Effective income tax rate (4.8 )% 73.5 % (12.7 )%

Impact, in basis points, from specified items and tax reform (1,920 ) 5,680 (2,790 )

The effective income tax rate in 2019 reflected a favorable impact relating to the timing of certain discrete items, as well as the recognition of $50 million of tax benefit recorded for the impacts of U.S. tax legislation that was enacted in December 2017, compared with additional tax expense of $640 million that was recognized as a result of this legislation in 2018. For further disclosures regarding our accounting for this U.S. tax legislation, refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2018 compared with 2017 reflected the additional tax expense relating to U.S. tax legislation, as noted above, as well as a less favorable benefit from specified items in 2018 compared with 2017.

Dilutive impact from share issuances $ — $ (0.30 ) $ (0.54 )

The dilutive impacts in 2018 and 2017 include the unfavorable impact of BD shares issued through public offerings of equity securities in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, in anticipation of the Bard acquisition. The dilutive impact in 2018 additionally includes the unfavorable impact of BD shares issued as consideration transferred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 for the Bard acquisition as is further discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Financial Instrument Market Risk
We selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk, primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations. The counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Foreign Exchange Risk
BD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. From time to time, we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements. Gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions. We did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2019 or 2018.
Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities.
With respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2019 and 2018, the impact that changes in the U.S. dollar would have on pre-tax earnings was estimated as follows:

------------------------------- ------------------- --- ---- - --- -

 Increase (decrease)
(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018
10% appreciation in U.S. dollar $ (16 ) $ (59 )
10% depreciation in U.S. dollar $ 16 $ 59

These calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments.

Table of Contents

Interest Rate Risk
When managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities.
The impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2019 and 2018, as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period, based upon our overall interest rate exposure, were estimated as follows:

------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- --------------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- - -- - - -- -

 Increase (decrease) to fair value of interest rate derivatives outstanding Increase (decrease) to earnings or cash flows
(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018 2019 2018
10% increase in interest rates $ 19 $ (22 ) $ (4 ) $ (7 )
10% decrease in interest rates $ (19 ) $ 23 $ 4 $ 7

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2019, 2018 and 2017:

------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- ---- ------- - - ------ -

(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018 2017
Net cash provided by (used for)
Operating activities $ 3,330 $ 2,865 $ 2,550
Investing activities $ (741 ) $ (15,733 ) $ (883 )
Financing activities $ (3,223 ) $ (58 ) $ 10,977

Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities in 2019 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash. This net use of cash primarily reflected lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses and higher levels of inventory, partially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses. The lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily attributable to cash paid related to income taxes and our product liability matters, as well as the timing and amount of interest payments due in the period. Cash flows from operating activities in 2019 additionally reflected $200 million of discretionary cash contributions to fund our pension obligation.

Cash flows from operating activities in 2018 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash. This net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily due to higher income taxes payable as a result of the new U.S. tax legislation discussed above, as well as lower levels of inventory, partially offset by higher levels of trade receivables. The change in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 also reflected a change to deferred tax asset and liability balances which were remeasured under the recently enacted tax legislation, which is further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The change in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 additionally reflected discretionary cash contributions of $287 million to fund our pension obligation.

Cash flows from operating activities in 2017 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash. This net use of cash primarily reflected higher levels of prepaid expenses, trade receivables and inventory, partially offset by higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses.

As previously discussed, cash flows from operating activities in 2019, 2018 and 2017 reflected losses recorded upon our extinguishment of certain long-term notes which are included within Other, net.
Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Capital expenditures

Our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities, and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets. Capital expenditures of $957 million, $895 million and $727 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily related to manufacturing capacity expansions. Details of spending by segment are contained in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Acquisitions of Businesses
Cash outflows for acquisitions in 2018 primarily related to our acquisition of Bard. Cash outflows for acquisitions in 2017 included payments for acquisitions which were immaterial both individually and in the aggregate. For further discussion, refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Divestitures
Cash inflows relating to divestitures in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $477 million, $534 million and $165 million, respectively. For further discussion, refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Net Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash from financing activities in 2019, 2018 and 2017 included the following significant cash flows:

Debt-Related Activities

Certain measures relating to our total debt were as follows:

----------------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- ---- ---- ------ ---- - - ------

 2019 2018 2017
Total debt (Millions of dollars) $ 19,390 $ 21,496 $ 18,870

Short-term debt as a percentage of total debt 6.8 % 12.1 % 1.1 %
Weighted average cost of total debt 2.9 % 3.2 % 3.3 %
Total debt as a percentage of total capital (a) 45.6 % 47.8 % 57.5 %

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Represents shareholders’ equity, net non-current deferred income tax liabilities, and debt.

The decrease in short-term debt as a percentage of total debt at September 30, 2019 was primarily driven by the payment of certain short-term notes as well as the issuance of long-term notes in 2019. The increase in short-term debt as a percentage of total debt at September 30, 2018 was primarily driven by the reclassification of certain notes from long-term to short-term. Additional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Cash and Short-term Investments
At September 30, 2019, total worldwide cash and short-term investments were $620 million, including restricted cash, which was primarily held in jurisdictions outside of the United States.
Financing Facilities

In May 2017, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility which provides borrowing of up to $2.25 billion. This facility will expire in December 2022. We are able to issue up to $100 million in letters of credit under this new revolving credit facility and it also includes a provision that enables BD, subject to additional commitments made by the lenders, to access up to an additional $500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2.75 billion. We use proceeds from this facility to fund general corporate needs. Borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2019 were $485 million.

The agreement for our revolving credit facility contained the following financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2019.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We are required to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 4-to-1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• We are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ 6-to-1 from the closing date of the Bard acquisition until and including the first fiscal quarter-end thereafter;

- -------------------------------------------------------------
◦ 5.75-to-1 for the subsequent four fiscal quarters thereafter;

- -------------------------------------------------------------
◦ 5.25-to-1 for the subsequent four fiscal quarters thereafter;

- ------------------------------------------------------------
◦ 4.5-to-1 for the subsequent four fiscal quarters thereafter;

- ----------------------------------------------------------
◦ 4-to-1 for the subsequent four fiscal quarters thereafter;

- ---------------------
◦ 3.75-to-1 thereafter.

We also have informal lines of credit outside the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company fully repaid its borrowings outstanding on a 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility that the Company entered in September 2018.  The Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2019. We may, from time to time, sell certain trade receivable assets to third parties as we manage working capital over the normal course of our business activities.

Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
Our corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P"), Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") were as follows at September 30, 2019:

--------------------- ------ -------- ------

 S&P Moody’s Fitch
Ratings:
Senior Unsecured Debt BBB Ba1 BBB-
Commercial Paper A-2 NP
Outlook Stable Positive Stable

In May 2019, Moody's Investor Service reaffirmed our September 30, 2018 ratings and revised the agency's outlook regarding the likely direction of these ratings over the medium term from Stable to Positive.

Lower corporate debt ratings and further downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing. We believe that given our debt ratings, our financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the non-cyclical, geographically diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.
Contractual Obligations
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. The table below sets forth BD’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of September 30, 2019:

----------------------------- --------------------- ------ ---- ----- ----------- ----- ----------- ------------------ ----- ------ ----- - ------

(b) Purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) Unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2019 of $519 million were all long-term in nature. Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of these tax positions, the related liability has been excluded from the table.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) Required funding obligations for 2020 relating to pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material.

Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given estimate

37

Table of Contents

or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.
Our agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Diagnostic Systems and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment. The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We generally estimate standalone selling prices using its list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.
Our gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which include rebates and sales discounts. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period. Additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates.
Impairment of Assets
Goodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, and other long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present.

We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or
one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units generally represent one
level below reporting segments. Potential impairment of goodwill is generally identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment test performed on July 1, 2019 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
We generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BD’s business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset, and potentially result in different impacts to BD’s results of operations. Actual results may differ from management’s estimates.
Income Taxes
BD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior

38

Table of Contents

earnings history, expected future earnings, carry back and carry forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
BD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. BD’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
We have reviewed our needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. As a result, after reevaluation of the permanent reinvestment assertion, we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2019. Additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Contingencies
We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. We establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). A determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. When appropriate, the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and, as in the case of certain mass tort litigation, the expertise of an actuarial specialist regarding the nature, timing and extent of each matter. The accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters. We record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when those recoveries are probable and collectible.
Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows.
Benefit Plans
We have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. These benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate. Pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.
The discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (September 30). Specifically for the U.S. pension plan, we will use a discount rate of 3.21% for 2020, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date. To calculate the pension expense in 2020, we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost. Additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2020 are provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long-term nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To

determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We will use a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.25% for the U.S. pension plan in 2020. We believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Discount rate — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $7 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs. This estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expected return on plan assets — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $5 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan costs.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

BD and its representatives may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “will,”, “may”, “anticipate,” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance (including volume growth, pricing, sales and earnings per share growth, and cash flows) and statements regarding our strategy for growth, future product development, regulatory approvals, competitive position and expenditures. All statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management’s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events, developments and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations.
The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Weakness in the global economy and financial markets, which could increase the cost of operating our business, weaken demand for our products and services, negatively impact the prices we can charge for our products and services, or impair our ability to produce our products.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Competitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions and technologies (for example, new forms of drug delivery) by our current or future competitors, consolidation or strategic alliances among healthcare companies, distributors and/or payers of healthcare to improve their competitive position or develop new models for the delivery of healthcare, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), new entrants into our markets and changes in the practice of medicine.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Risks relating to our acquisition of Bard, including our ability to successfully combine and integrate the Bard operations in order to obtain the anticipated benefits and costs savings from the transaction, and the significant additional indebtedness we incurred in connection with the financing of the acquisition and the impact it may have on our ability to operate the combined company.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Regional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation, and fluctuations in interest rates, and their potential effect on our operating performance.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in reimbursement practices of governments or third-party payers, or adverse decisions relating to our products by such payers, which could reduce demand for our products or the price we can charge for such products.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The impact of the medical device excise tax under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States. While this tax has been suspended through December 31, 2019, absent further legislative action, it will be reinstated in 2020.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Cost containment efforts in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, including alternative payment reform and increased use of competitive bidding and tenders.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in the domestic and foreign healthcare industry or in medical practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The impact of changes in U.S. federal laws and policy that could affect fiscal and tax policies, healthcare, and international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements. In particular, tariffs or other trade barriers imposed by the U.S. could adversely impact our supply chain costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increases in operating costs, including fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, used in our products, the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships (particularly with respect to sole-source suppliers), and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Security breaches of our information technology systems or our products, which could impair our ability to conduct business, result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of customers' patients, or result in product efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products, and result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The impact of business combinations or divestitures, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquisition-related costs, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our ability to penetrate or expand our operations in emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Conditions in international markets, including social and political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, tariffs and other protectionist measures, difficulties in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and governmental expropriation of assets. This includes the possible impact of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union ("EU"), which has created uncertainties affecting our business operations in the United Kingdom and the EU, and possibly other countries. Our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as regulatory and privacy laws.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Deficit reduction efforts or other actions that reduce the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, which could weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The effects of weather, regulatory or other events that adversely impact our supply chain, including our ability to manufacture our products (particularly where production of a product line or sterilization operations are concentrated in one or more plants), source materials or components or services from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing (including sterilization), or provide products to our customers, including events that impact key distributors.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Pending and potential future litigation or other proceedings asserting, and/or subpoenas seeking information with respect to, alleged violations of law (including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid) and/or sales and marketing practices (such as investigative subpoenas and the civil investigative demands received by BD and Bard)), antitrust claims, product liability (which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including claims relating to our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence products for women and vena cava filter products), claims with respect to environmental matters, and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• New or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including laws relating to trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation (including tax reforms that could adversely impact multinational corporations), sales practices, environmental protection, price controls, and licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and products in the postmarketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Product efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product holds or recalls, regulatory action on the part of the FDA or foreign counterparts (including restrictions on future product clearances and civil penalties), declining sales and product liability claims, and damage to our reputation. As a result of the CareFusion acquisition, we are operating under a consent decree with the FDA relating to our U.S. infusion pump business. The consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing products, recall products or take other actions, and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages if we fail to comply with any provision of the consent decree. Also, in 2019, the FDA letter to healthcare professionals regarding the use of paclitaxel-coated devices in the treatment of peripheral artery disease resulted in decreased sales of BD’s drug-coated balloons. While we have changed the labeling on our products as required by the FDA and continue to work with the FDA on patient data, the extent and duration of the impact from the FDA letter, and the likelihood of FDA approval of new drug-coated devices, is difficult to predict.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BD’s business or operations, including the effect on BD’s reputation or demand for its products.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BD’s pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.

(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2  For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2019, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...

Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, data centers, land, and colocations with original lease periods expiring between 2019 and 2093. We are committed to pay a portion of the related actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. Certain of these arrangements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions, and we recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis. The following is a schedule, by years, of the future minimum lease payments required under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): ---------------------------- ---------------- ------ Operating Leases 2019 $ 698 2020 946 2021 1,055 2022 1,048 2023 1,054 Thereafter 9,850 Total minimum lease payments $ 14,651 Operating lease expense was $629 million, $363 million, and $269 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We fully repaid all our capital lease obligations during 2016. Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc.

Excluding the loan amounts described in detail below, loans outstanding to persons who were executive officers and directors during the year ended at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and their related interests as well as to the Bank's affiliated entities amounted to $0 and $249 thousand, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, all of which were performing in accordance with their respective terms as of those dates. These loans were made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms and conditions, including interest rates and collateral, as those of comparable transactions with non-insiders prevailing at the time, in accordance with the Bank's underwriting guidelines, and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. The Bank has an Employee Loan Program which is available to all employees and offers executive officers, directors and principal stockholders that meet the eligibility requirements the opportunity to participate on the same terms as employees generally, provided that any loan to an executive officer, director or principal stockholder must be approved by the Bank's Board of Directors. The sole benefit provided under the Employee Loan Program is a reduction in loan fees.

Note 28. Discontinued Operations On June 5, 2018, we sold 48% of National Beef to Marfrig for $907.7 million in cash, reducing our ownership in National Beef to 31%. Marfrig also acquired an additional 3% of National Beef from other equity owners and now owns 51% of National Beef. We have the right to designate two board members and have a series of other rights in respect of our continuing equity interest, with a lockup period of five years and thereafter fair market value liquidity protections. As of the closing of the sale on June 5, 2018, we deconsolidated our investment in National Beef and account for our remaining interest under the equity method of accounting. The sale of National Beef meets the accounting criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation as the sale represents a strategic shift that has a major effect in our operations and financial results. As such, we have classified the results of National Beef prior to June 5, 2018 as a discontinued operation and reported those results in Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. A summary of the results of discontinued operations for National Beef is as follows (in thousands): ---------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- --------- ------------------------------------- --------- ------------------------------------- --------- --------- - --------- Period Ended June 4, 2018 (1) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 Revenues: Beef processing services $ 3,137,611 $ 7,353,663 $ 7,021,902 Interest income 131 339 166 Other 4,329 4,946 5,175 Total revenues 3,142,071 7,358,948 7,027,243 Expenses: Compensation and benefits 17,414 39,884 39,271 Cost of sales 2,884,983 6,764,055 6,513,768 Interest expense 4,316 6,657 12,946 Depreciation and amortization 43,959 98,515 94,482 Selling, general and other expenses 14,291 42,525 37,754 Total expenses 2,964,963 6...

['s outlook regarding the likely direction of these ratings over the medium term from Stable to Positive.

Lower corporate debt ratings and further downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing. We believe that given our debt ratings, our financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the non-cyclical, geographically diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.
Contractual Obligations
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. The table below sets forth BD’s significant contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of September 30, 2019:

Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given estimate

37

Table of Contents

or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.
Our agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Diagnostic Systems and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment. The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We generally estimate standalone selling prices using its list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.
Our gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which include rebates and sales discounts. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period. Additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates.
Impairment of Assets
Goodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, and other long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present.

We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or
one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units generally represent one
level below reporting segments. Potential impairment of goodwill is generally identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment test performed on July 1, 2019 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
We generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BD’s business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset, and potentially result in different impacts to BD’s results of operations. Actual results may differ from management’s estimates.
Income Taxes
BD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior

38

Table of Contents

earnings history, expected future earnings, carry back and carry forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
BD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. BD’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
We have reviewed our needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. As a result, after reevaluation of the permanent reinvestment assertion, we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2019. Additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Contingencies
We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. We establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). A determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. When appropriate, the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and, as in the case of certain mass tort litigation, the expertise of an actuarial specialist regarding the nature, timing and extent of each matter. The accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our strategy in dealing with these matters. We record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when those recoveries are probable and collectible.
Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows.
Benefit Plans
We have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. These benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate. Pension benefit costs also include an assumption for the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.
The discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (September 30). Specifically for the U.S. pension plan, we will use a discount rate of 3.21% for 2020, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date. To calculate the pension expense in 2020, we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost. Additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2020 are provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long-term nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To

39

Table of Contents

determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We will use a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.25% for the U.S. pension plan in 2020. We believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Discount rate — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $7 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs. This estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expected return on plan assets — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $5 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan costs.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

BD and its representatives may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “will,”, “may”, “anticipate,” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance (including volume growth, pricing, sales and earnings per share growth, and cash flows) and statements regarding our strategy for growth, future product development, regulatory approvals, competitive position and expenditures. All statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management’s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events, developments and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations.
The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.

Interest income 12 65 76
Net interest expense $ (627 ) $ (641 ) $ (445 )

The decrease in interest expense in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily reflected higher fees incurred in 2018 to draw from our term loan facility, which is further discussed below. Interest expense in 2019 was also favorably impacted by debt repayments during the current year, as well as lower overall interest rates on debt outstanding during the current-year period as a result of refinancing activities. The increase in interest expense in 2018 compared with 2017 reflected higher levels of debt for the full-year period due to our issuances of senior unsecured U.S. notes during the third quarter of 2017. Additional disclosures regarding our financing arrangements and debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8.

The decrease in interest income in 2019 compared with 2018 reflected higher levels of cash on hand in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 in anticipation of closing the Bard acquisition at the end of the quarter. The decrease in interest income in 2018 compared with 2017 reflected lower cash levels in the remaining quarters of 2018, subsequent to the closing of the Bard acquisition.
Income Taxes

The income tax rates in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------ ------ -- ---- ----- ---- ------ --

 2019 2018 2017
Effective income tax rate (4.8 )% 73.5 % (12.7 )%

Impact, in basis points, from specified items and tax reform (1,920 ) 5,680 (2,790 )

The effective income tax rate in 2019 reflected a favorable impact relating to the timing of certain discrete items, as well as the recognition of $50 million of tax benefit recorded for the impacts of U.S. tax legislation that was enacted in December 2017, compared with additional tax expense of $640 million that was recognized as a result of this legislation in 2018. For further disclosures regarding our accounting for this U.S. tax legislation, refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2018 compared with 2017 reflected the additional tax expense relating to U.S. tax legislation, as noted above, as well as a less favorable benefit from specified items in 2018 compared with 2017.

Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share
Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- ------ - - ----- -

 2019 2018 2017
Net income (Millions of dollars) $ 1,233 $ 311 $ 1,100
Diluted Earnings per Share $ 3.94 $ 0.60 $ 4.60

Unfavorable impact-specified items $ (7.74 ) $ (10.11 ) $ (4.34 )
(Unfavorable) favorable impact-foreign currency translation $ (0.62 ) $ 0.32 $ (0.23 )
Dilutive impact from share issuances $ — $ (0.30 ) $ (0.54 )

The dilutive impacts in 2018 and 2017 include the unfavorable impact of BD shares issued through public offerings of equity securities in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, in anticipation of the Bard acquisition. The dilutive impact in 2018 additionally includes the unfavorable impact of BD shares issued as consideration transferred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 for the Bard acquisition as is further discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Financial Instrument Market Risk
We selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk, primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations. The counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Foreign Exchange Risk
BD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. From time to time, we may purchase forward contracts and options to hedge certain forecasted transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to partially protect against a reduction in the value of future earnings resulting from adverse foreign exchange rate movements. Gains or losses on derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions. We did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2019 or 2018.
Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities.
With respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2019 and 2018, the impact that changes in the U.S. dollar would have on pre-tax earnings was estimated as follows:

------------------------------- ------------------- --- ---- - --- -

 Increase (decrease)
(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018
10% appreciation in U.S. dollar $ (16 ) $ (59 )
10% depreciation in U.S. dollar $ 16 $ 59

These calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments.

Interest Rate Risk
When managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities.
The impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2019 and 2018, as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period, based upon our overall interest rate exposure, were estimated as follows:

------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- --------------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- - -- - - -- -

 Increase (decrease) to fair value of interest rate derivatives outstanding Increase (decrease) to earnings or cash flows
(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018 2019 2018
10% increase in interest rates $ 19 $ (22 ) $ (4 ) $ (7 )
10% decrease in interest rates $ (19 ) $ 23 $ 4 $ 7

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2019, 2018 and 2017:

------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- ---- ------- - - ------ -

(Millions of dollars) 2019 2018 2017
Net cash provided by (used for)
Operating activities $ 3,330 $ 2,865 $ 2,550
Investing activities $ (741 ) $ (15,733 ) $ (883 )
Financing activities $ (3,223 ) $ (58 ) $ 10,977

Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities in 2019 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash. This net use of cash primarily reflected lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses and higher levels of inventory, partially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses. The lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily attributable to cash paid related to income taxes and our product liability matters, as well as the timing and amount of interest payments due in the period. Cash flows from operating activities in 2019 additionally reflected $200 million of discretionary cash contributions to fund our pension obligation.

Cash flows from operating activities in 2018 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash. This net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily due to higher income taxes payable as a result of the new U.S. tax legislation discussed above, as well as lower levels of inventory, partially offset by higher levels of trade receivables. The change in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 also reflected a change to deferred tax asset and liability balances which were remeasured under the recently enacted tax legislation, which is further discussed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The change in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 additionally reflected discretionary cash contributions of $287 million to fund our pension obligation.

Cash flows from operating activities in 2017 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash. This net use of cash primarily reflected higher levels of prepaid expenses, trade receivables and inventory, partially offset by higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Debt-Related Activities

Certain measures relating to our total debt were as follows:

----------------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- ---- ---- ------ ---- - - ------

 2019 2018 2017
Total debt (Millions of dollars) $ 19,390 $ 21,496 $ 18,870

Short-term debt as a percentage of total debt 6.8 % 12.1 % 1.1 %
Weighted average cost of total debt 2.9 % 3.2 % 3.3 %
Total debt as a percentage of total capital (a) 45.6 % 47.8 % 57.5 %

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Represents shareholders’ equity, net non-current deferred income tax liabilities, and debt.

The decrease in short-term debt as a percentage of total debt at September 30, 2019 was primarily driven by the payment of certain short-term notes as well as the issuance of long-term notes in 2019. The increase in short-term debt as a percentage of total debt at September 30, 2018 was primarily driven by the reclassification of certain notes from long-term to short-term. Additional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Cash and Short-term Investments
At September 30, 2019, total worldwide cash and short-term investments were $620 million, including restricted cash, which was primarily held in jurisdictions outside of the United States.
Financing Facilities

In May 2017, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility which provides borrowing of up to $2.25 billion. This facility will expire in December 2022. We are able to issue up to $100 million in letters of credit under this new revolving credit facility and it also includes a provision that enables BD, subject to additional commitments made by the lenders, to access up to an additional $500 million in financing through the facility for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2.75 billion. We use proceeds from this facility to fund general corporate needs. Borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2019 were $485 million.

The agreement for our revolving credit facility contained the following financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants as of September 30, 2019.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We are required to maintain an interest expense coverage ratio of not less than 4-to-1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• We are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ 6-to-1 from the closing date of the Bard acquisition until and including the first fiscal quarter-end thereafter;

- -------------------------------------------------------------
◦ 5.75-to-1 for the subsequent four fiscal quarters thereafter;

- -------------------------------------------------------------
◦ 5.25-to-1 for the subsequent four fiscal quarters thereafter;

- ------------------------------------------------------------
◦ 4.5-to-1 for the subsequent four fiscal quarters thereafter;

- ----------------------------------------------------------
◦ 4-to-1 for the subsequent four fiscal quarters thereafter;

- ---------------------
◦ 3.75-to-1 thereafter.

We also have informal lines of credit outside the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company fully repaid its borrowings outstanding on a 364-day senior unsecured term loan facility that the Company entered in September 2018.  The Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2019. We may, from time to time, sell certain trade receivable assets to third parties as we manage working capital over the normal course of our business activities.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...
