ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. — "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." All references to "Tenneco," "we," "us," "our" and "the Company" refer to Tenneco Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Notes referenced in this discussion and analysis refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements that are found in Item 8.—"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."

The consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 have been revised to correct for prior period errors as discussed in Item 8 — Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Accordingly, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect the effects of the revisions.

OVERVIEW
Our Company
We are one of the world’s leading manufacturers of clean air, powertrain and ride performance products and systems for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial and aftermarket customers. Both original equipment (OE) vehicle designers and manufacturers and the repair and replacement markets, or aftermarket, are served globally through leading brands, including Monroe®, Champion®, Öhlins®, MOOG®, Walker®, Fel-Pro®, Wagner®, Ferodo®, Rancho®, Thrush®, National®, and Sealed Power®, among others. As of December 31, 2018, we operated 210 manufacturing facilities worldwide and employed approximately 81,000 people to service our customers’ demands.

Factors that continue to be critical to our success include winning new business awards, managing our overall global manufacturing footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs, maintaining competitive wages and benefits, maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes and reducing overall costs. In addition, our ability to adapt to key industry trends, (such as a shift in consumer preferences to other vehicles in response to higher fuel costs and other economic and social factors, increasing technologically sophisticated content, changing aftermarket distribution channels, increasing environmental standards and extended product life of automotive parts), also play a critical role in our success. Other factors that are critical to our success include adjusting to economic challenges such as increases in the cost of raw materials and our ability to successfully reduce the impact of any such cost increases through material substitutions, cost reduction initiatives and other methods.

For 2018, light vehicle production was slightly down compared to 2017 in some of the geographic regions in which we operate. Light vehicle production was down 1% in both North America and Europe, and down 4% in China. Light vehicle production was up 6% in India and 3% in South America.

Federal-Mogul Acquisition
On October 1, 2018, we closed the acquisition of Federal-Mogul LLC ("Federal-Mogul"), (the "Acquisition" or the “Federal-Mogul Acquisition”) pursuant to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 10, 2018 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among us, Federal-Mogul, American Entertainment Properties Corp. (“AEP”) and Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“IEP”). Total consideration was approximately $3.7 billion. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

As a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, the number of our reportable segments increased from three to five segments, consisting of: our historical Clean Air, Ride Performance, and Aftermarket segments and the newly acquired Powertrain and Motorparts segments. Segment information for periods prior to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition do not include amounts for the Federal-Mogul operations.

Our reportable segments, which are also our operating segments, align with how the Chief Operating Decision Maker allocates resources and assesses performance against our key growth strategies. We evaluate segment performance based primarily on earnings before interest expense, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA including noncontrolling interests).

Financial Executive Summary

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We reported total revenue for 2018 of $11,763 million, up 27% from $9,274 million in 2017. The Federal-Mogul acquisition increased revenues by approximately $1,886 million, or 20%, in 2018. The remaining increase in our revenues of $603 million, or 7%, was driven by the growth in Clean Air and Ride Performance segments. Excluding the impact of currency and substrate sales, organic revenue was up $292 million, or 4%, from $7,087 million to $7,379 million, which was driven primarily by stronger light vehicle volumes, higher commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenues and new platforms.

• Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests (EBIT) was $306 million for 2018, a decrease of $102 million, when compared to $408 million in 2017. Excluding the Federal-Mogul acquisition, EBIT decreased compared to 2017, as higher light vehicle volumes, increased commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenues and new platforms were more than offset by unfavorable mix, price reductions, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher restructuring and related expenses, costs related to the Acquisition and expected spin, loss on extinguishment of debt, a litigation settlement charge, and continued investments in growth for new programs. EBIT in 2017 also included a $132 million antitrust settlement accrual, a $11 million goodwill impairment charge and $13 million in charges related to pension derisking and the acceleration of restricted stock vesting. See “Segment Results of Operations” for further information on EBIT including noncontrolling interests.

Revenues
Total revenue for 2018 was $11,763 million, up 27% from $9,274 million in 2017. The Federal-Mogul Acquisition increased revenues by approximately $1,886 million, or 20%, in 2018. Excluding the Acquisition, organic revenues increased $603 million, or 7%, driven by the growth in Clean Air and Ride Performance segments. Excluding the impact of currency and substrate sales, organic revenue was up $292 million, or 4%, from $7,087 million to $7,379 million, which was driven primarily by stronger light vehicle volumes, higher commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenues and new platforms. The following table lists the primary drivers behind the change in revenues ($ millions).

Year ended December 31, 2018 $ 11,763

Cost of sales
Cost of sales for 2018 was $10,071 million, or 86% of sales, compared to $7,812 million, or 84% of sales in 2017. Excluding the Acquisition, organic cost of sales for 2018 was $8,434 million or 85% of organic sales. The following table lists the primary drivers behind the change in cost of sales ($ millions).

----------------------------------------------- ----- ------

Year ended December 31, 2017 $ 7,812
Federal-Mogul Acquisition 1,637
Drivers in the change of organic cost of sales:
Volume and mix 556
Material 13
Currency exchange rates 6
Restructuring and cost to achieve synergies 28
Other costs 19
Year ended December 31, 2018 $ 10,071

The impact of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition increased the cost of sales by $1,637 million in 2018. The remaining increase in our organic cost of sales was mainly due to the year-over-year increase in volume, higher material costs, higher restructuring and costs to achieve synergies, higher manufacturing and impact of currency. Also refer to section below "Restructuring charges."

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
SG&A was up $156 million in 2018, at $794 million, compared to $638 million in 2017. The increase was due primarily to the impact of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. Excluding the Acquisition, included in 2018 was $92 million of Acquisition and expected spin costs, $25 million of costs to achieve synergies, $18 million of cost reduction initiatives and $10 million of litigation settlement, while 2017 included a $132 million antitrust settlement accrual and $22 million of cost reduction initiatives. Also refer to section below "Restructuring charges."

Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $345 million and $226 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was due primarily to the impact of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Engineering, research, and development
Engineering, research, and development expense was $204 million and $158 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase was due primarily to the impact of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. Also refer to section below "Restructuring charges."

Goodwill impairment charge
As a result of our goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined the fair value of the North America Ride Performance reporting unit was lower than its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. This compared to an $11 million goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2017, which related to our Europe and South America Aftermarket and Ride Performance reporting units.

Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs
Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs was up $4 million in 2018 at $20 million compared to $16 million at 2017.

Loss on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt was $10 million in 2018 related to the repayment of our revolver and term loan A and the new refinancing in connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. This compared to a $1 million charge recognized in 2017.

Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax
Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax was up $19 million in 2018, at $18 million, compared to a loss of $1 million in 2017. The increase was due to the impact of Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Interest expense, net of interest capitalized
Interest expense in 2018 was $132 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $5 million, and $72 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $8 million in 2017. The $60 million increase was primarily due to higher interest expense pertaining to the five-year $1,700 million term loan A facility and the seven-year
$1,700 million term loan B facility that were entered into in connection with the Acquisition and the interest expense on Federal-Mogul debt obligations assumed in the Acquisition, partially offset by the lower interest expense as a result of the retirement of the Company's term loan A and revolver borrowings on October 1, 2018 related to the Acquisition.

For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources -Capitalization” later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $63 million on earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $174 million in 2018 as compared to income tax expense of $71 million on earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $336 million in 2017. The tax expense recorded in 2018 included tax benefits of $10 million relating to a valuation allowance release at our Australian entities and $11 million of tax expense for changes in the toll tax as discussed below. The tax expense recorded in 2017 includes a net provisional tax expense of $43 million for one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") as discussed below. The Company remeasured U.S. deferred taxes from an applicable federal rate of 35% to the new statutory rate of 21% at which they are expected to be utilized, recording a $51 million provisional expense. The tax expense recorded in 2017 included a net tax benefit of $74 million relating to recognizing a U.S. tax benefit for foreign taxes.

Net Income
Net income was $111 million for 2018, as compared to $265 million for 2017, a decrease of $154 million, as result of the aforementioned items.

Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Noncontrolling Interests and Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA including noncontrolling interests”)
EBITDA including noncontrolling interests was $651 million for 2018, an increase of $17 million, when compared to
$634 million in 2017, as a result of the aforementioned items. See “Segment Results of Operations” for further information on EBITDA including noncontrolling interests.

Segment Results of Operations

Overview of Net Sales and Operating Revenues
Our Clean Air segment has substrate sales. Substrates are porous ceramic filters coated with a catalyst - typically, precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. We do not manufacture substrates, they are supplied to us by Tier 2 suppliers generally as directed by our OE customers. We generally earn a small margin on these components of the system. These substrate components have been increasing as a percentage of our revenue as the need for more sophisticated emission control solutions increases to meet more stringent environmental regulations, and as we capture more diesel aftertreatment business. While these substrates dilute our gross margin percentage, they are a necessary component of an emission control system.

Our value-add content in an emission control system includes designing the system to meet environmental regulations through integration of the substrates into the system, maximizing use of thermal energy to heat up the catalyst quickly, efficiently managing airflow to reduce back pressure as the exhaust stream moves past the catalyst, managing the expansion and contraction of the emission control system components due to temperature extremes experienced by an emission control system, using advanced acoustic engineering tools to design the desired exhaust sound, minimizing the opportunity for the fragile components of the substrate to be damaged when we integrate it into the emission control system and reducing unwanted noise, vibration and harshness transmitted through the emission control system.

We present these substrate sales separately in the following table because we believe investors utilize this information to understand the impact of this portion of our revenues on our overall business and because it removes the impact of potentially volatile precious metals pricing from our revenues. While our OE customers generally assume the risk of precious metals pricing volatility, it impacts our reported revenues.

Finally, we present these reconciliations of revenues in order to reflect value-add revenues without the effect of changes in foreign currency rates. We have not reflected any currency impact in the base period of the comparisons for measuring the effects of currency in the subsequent year.

Segment Revenue
Clean Air revenue was up $491 million to $6,707 million in 2018 compared to $6,216 million in 2017. Higher volumes drove a $486 million increase due to higher light vehicle revenues, higher commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle sales, as well as new platforms, partially offset by price reductions and the negative impact of the end of OE customer production in Australia. Currency had a $45 million favorable impact on Clean Air revenues.

Ride Performance revenue was up $142 million to $1,949 million in 2018 compared to $1,807 million in 2017. Higher volumes drove a $138 million increase due to increased light vehicle and commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle sales and new platforms. Currency had a $4 million unfavorable impact on Ride Performance revenues.

Aftermarket revenue was down $30 million to $1,221 million in 2018 compared to $1,251 million in 2017 due to lower volumes and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. Currency had a $29 million unfavorable impact on Aftermarket revenues.

As a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, Powertrain revenue was $1,112 million and Motorparts revenue was $774 million in 2018.

(1) As a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, we changed our key performance measure. We now use EBITDA including noncontrolling interests as the key performance measure in our financial and operational decision making processes, for internal reporting, and for planning and forecasting purposes to effectively allocate resources. EBITDA including noncontrolling interests is defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, and depreciation and amortization. Prior period results have been retrospectively recast to reflect the change in our key performance measure. This non-GAAP measure is accompanied by a reconciliation to the comparable US GAAP measure, net income, in the table above. EBITDA including noncontrolling interests should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with US GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income. EBITDA including noncontrolling interests, as determined and measured by us, should not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Revenues
Total revenue for 2017 was $9,274 million, up 8% from $8,597 million in 2016, on strong global light vehicle and commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenues, driven by the Clean Air and Ride Performance product lines. Excluding the impact of currency and substrate sales, revenue was up $449 million from $6,569 million to $7,018 million. The increase in revenues was driven primarily by stronger OE light vehicle volumes and higher commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenues in all regions as well as new platforms.

The following table lists the primary drivers behind the change in revenues ($ millions).

Year ended December 31, 2017 $ 7,812

The increase in cost of sales was mainly due to the year-over-year increase in volume, higher net material costs, higher other costs, mainly manufacturing, higher restructuring costs and the impact of currency exchange rates. Also refer to section below "Restructuring charges."

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
SG&A was up $124 million in 2017, at $638 million, compared to $514 million in 2016. Included in 2017 was $132 million antitrust settlement accrual. Also refer to section below "Restructuring charges."

Engineering, research, and development
Engineering, research, and development expense was $158 million and $153 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Also refer to section below "Restructuring charges."

Goodwill impairment charge
As a result of our goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2017, we determined the estimated fair value of the Europe and South America Ride Performance and Aftermarket reporting unit was lower than its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs
Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs was down $68 million in 2017 at $16 million compared to $84 million at 2016. Included in 2016 were $72 million in pension buyout charges.

The tax expense recorded in 2017 included a tax benefit of $12 million primarily relating to valuation allowance releases, a provisional amount of $43 million for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We remeasured U.S. deferred taxes from an applicable federal rate of 35% to the new statutory rate of 21% at which they are expected to be utilized, recording a $46 million provisional expense. The tax expense recorded in 2017 included a net tax benefit of $74 million relating to recognizing a U.S. tax benefit for foreign taxes. In addition, the 2017 tax expense included a $50 million tax benefit related to an antitrust settlement accrual. We reported an income tax benefit of $4 million in 2016. The tax benefit recorded in 2016 included a net tax benefit of $110 million primarily relating to recognizing a U.S. tax benefit for foreign taxes.

Segment Revenue
Clean Air revenue was up $452 million to $6,216 million in 2017 compared to $5,764 million in 2016. Higher volumes drove a $432 million increase due to higher light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle sales as well as new platforms, partially offset by unfavorable pricing and mix. Currency had a $49 million favorable impact on Clean Air revenues.

Ride Performance revenue was up $214 million to $1,807 million in 2017 compared to $1,593 million in 2016. Higher volumes drove a $192 million increase due to higher light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle sales as well as new platforms. Currency had a $27 million favorable impact on Ride Performance revenues.

Aftermarket revenue was up $11 million to $1,251 million in 2017 compared to $1,240 million in 2016. Lower volumes drove a $30 million decrease, which was more than offset by favorable mix and pricing and a $10 million favorable currency impact.

(1) As a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, we changed our key performance measure. We now use EBITDA including noncontrolling interests as the key performance measure in our financial and operational decision making processes, for internal reporting, and for planning and forecasting purposes to effectively allocate resources. EBITDA including noncontrolling interests is defined as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, and depreciation and amortization. Prior period results have been retrospectively recast to reflect the change in our key performance measure. This non-GAAP measure is accompanied by a reconciliation to the comparable US GAAP measure, net income, in the table above. EBITDA including noncontrolling interests should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with US GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income. EBITDA including noncontrolling interests, as determined and measured by us, should not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Short-term debt, which includes maturities classified as current, borrowings by the parent company and foreign subsidiaries, and borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization programs, were $153 million and $103 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which are classified as long-term debt, at December 31, 2018 and were $244 million at December 31, 2017.

The 2018 year-to-date increase in our shareholders' equity primarily resulted from net income attributable to Tenneco Inc. of $55 million, an increase of $143 million in noncontrolling interest equity resulting from the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, and a $1.2 billion increase in premium on common stock and other capital surplus relating to the new common stock issued for the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, partially offset by a $132 million decrease caused by the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the translation of financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars and cash dividend payments of $59 million.

New Credit Facility - General
On October 1, 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and other lenders (the “New Credit Facility”) in connection with the acquisition of Federal-Mogul. The New Credit Facility consists of $4.9 billion of total debt financing, consisting of a five-year $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a five-year $1.7 billion term loan A facility ("Term Loan A") and a seven-year $1.7 billion term loan B facility ("Term Loan B"). Proceeds from the New Credit Facility were used to finance the cash consideration portion of the Acquisition purchase price, to refinance our then existing senior credit facilities, inclusive of the revolver and the tranche term loan A then outstanding (the "Old Credit Facility"), certain senior credit facilities of Federal-Mogul, to pay Acquisition fees and expenses, and the financing thereof. The remainder, including future borrowings under the revolving credit facility, will be used for general corporate purposes.

We and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tenneco Automotive Operating Company Inc., are borrowers under the New Credit Facility, and we are the sole borrower under the Term Loan A and Term Loan B facilities. The New Credit Facility is guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of our material domestic subsidiaries. Drawings under the revolving credit facility may be in U.S. dollars, British pounds or euros.

The New Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets, our subsidiary guarantors, and by pledges of up to 66% of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries. The security for the New Credit Facility will be pari passu with the security for outstanding senior secured notes of Federal-Mogul that we assumed in connection with the Acquisition. If any of our foreign subsidiaries is added to the revolving credit facility as a borrower, the obligations of such foreign borrower will be secured by the assets of such foreign borrower, and also will be secured by the assets of, and guaranteed by, the domestic borrowers and domestic guarantors as well as certain of our foreign subsidiaries in the chain of ownership of such foreign borrower.

As a result of the refinancing of the revolving credit loan and tranche A term loan under the Old Credit Facility, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily consisting of debt issuance costs incurred at the transaction date and write-off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the refinanced revolving credit loan and tranche A term loan. We also recorded $1 million of loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to amendment and restatement of the Old Credit Facility and the write off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Old Credit Facility.

Table of Contents

New Credit Facility - Interest Rates and Fees
The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan A facility will initially be LIBOR plus 1.75%, which interest rate will be subject to change if our consolidated net leverage ratio changes. Initially, and so long as our corporate family rating is Ba3 (with a stable outlook) or higher from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BB- (with a stable outlook) or higher from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), the interest rate on borrowings under the term loan B facility will be LIBOR plus 2.75%; at any time the foregoing conditions are not satisfied, the interest rate on the term loan B facility will be LIBOR plus 3.00%. When the term loan B facility is no longer outstanding and we and our subsidiaries have no other secured indebtedness (with certain exceptions set forth in the New Credit Facility), and upon our achieving and maintaining two or more corporate credit and/or corporate family ratings higher than or equal to BBB- from S&P, BBB- from Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”) and/or Baa3 from Moody’s (in each case, with a stable or positive outlook), the collateral under the New Credit Facility may be released.

New Credit Facility - Other Terms and Conditions
The New Credit Facility contains representations and warranties, and covenants which are customary for debt facilities of this type. The covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, to (i) incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders, (iii) purchase or redeem our equity interests, (iv) make investments, (v) create liens on their assets, (vi) enter into transactions with our affiliates, (vii) sell assets and (viii) merge or consolidate with, or dispose of substantially all of our assets to, other companies.

The New Credit Facility includes customary events of default and other provisions that could require all amounts due thereunder to become immediately due and payable, either automatically or at the option of the lenders, if we fail to comply with the terms of the New Credit Facility or if other customary events occur.

The New Credit Facility also contains two financial maintenance covenants for the revolving credit facility and the term loan A facility including (x) a requirement to have a consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) as of the end of each fiscal quarter of not greater than 4.0 to 1 through September 30, 2019, 3.75 to 1 through September 30, 2020 and 3.5 to 1 thereafter; and (y) a requirement to maintain consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of not less than 2.75 to 1.

The financial ratios required under the New Credit Facility and the actual ratios we calculated as of December 31, 2018 for the fourth quarter of 2018, are as follows: leverage ratio of 2.74 actual versus 4.00 (maximum) required; and interest coverage ratio of 6.50 actual versus 2.75 (minimum) required.

The covenants in our New Credit Facility generally prohibit us from repaying or refinancing our senior unsecured notes. So long as no default exists, we would, however, under our New Credit Facility, be permitted to repay or refinance our senior unsecured notes (i) with the net cash proceeds of permitted refinancing indebtedness (as defined in the New Credit Facility); (ii) in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of qualified capital stock (as defined in the New Credit Facility) issued after October 1, 2018 and (iii) in exchange for qualified capital stock issued after October 1, 2018; and (iv) with additional payments provided that such additional payments are capped as follows based on a pro forma consolidated leverage ratio after giving effect to such additional payments:

 (Millions)
Greater than or equal to 2.25x $ 360 $360 x Post Spin-Off EBITDA/Pre Spin-Off EBITDA
Less than 2.25x unlimited unlimited

Although the New Credit Facility agreement would permit us to repay or refinance our senior notes under the conditions described above, any repayment or refinancing of our outstanding notes would be subject to market conditions and either the voluntary participation of note holders or our ability to redeem the notes under the terms of the applicable note indenture. For example, while the New Credit Facility agreement would allow us to repay our outstanding notes via a direct exchange of the notes for either permitted refinancing indebtedness or for shares of our common stock, we do not, under the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding notes, have the right to refinance the notes via any type of direct exchange.

The New Credit Facility agreement also contains other restrictions on our operations that are customary for similar facilities, including limitations on: (i) incurring additional liens; (ii) sale and leaseback transactions (except for the permitted transactions as described in the New Credit Facility agreement); (iii) liquidations and dissolutions; (iv) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees; (v) investments and acquisitions; (vi) dividends and share repurchases; (vii) mergers and consolidations; and

(viii) refinancing of the senior notes. Compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the New Credit Facility agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans.

As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants and operational restrictions of the New Credit Facility.

In connection with the Acquisition of Federal-Mogul on October 1, 2018, we assumed an aggregate principal amount of €350 million ($401 million) 5.000% euro denominated fixed rate notes which are due July 15, 2024 ("5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes"), an aggregate principle amount of €415 million ($476 million) 4.875% euro denominated fixed rate notes due April 15, 2022 ("4.875% Euro Fixed Rate Notes"), and aggregate principal amount of €300 million ($344 million) floating rate notes due April 15, 2024 ("Euro Floating Rate Notes", and together with the 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the 4.875% Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the "Senior Unsecured Notes"). The Senior Secured Notes will rank equally in right of payment to all our indebtedness under our New Credit Facility.

We are permitted to redeem some or all of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes at specified redemption prices that decline to par over a specified period, at any time (a) on or after July 15, 2020, in the case of the 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes, (b) on or after April 15, 2019, in the case of the 4.875% Euro Fixed Rate Notes and (c) on or after April 15, 2018, in the case of the Euro Floating Rate Notes. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes may also be redeemed at a price generally equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a premium based on the present values of the remaining payments due to the note holders. Further, we may also redeem up to 40% of the 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the 4.875% Euro Fixed Rate Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time prior to (a) July 15, 2020 at a redemption price of 105.0% in the case of the 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes, and (b) April 15, 2019 at a redemption price of 104.875% in the case of the 4.875% Euro Fixed Rate Notes.

If we experience specified kinds of changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if we sell certain of our assets and do not apply the proceeds from the sale in a certain manner within 365 days of the sale, we must offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We have designated a portion of the Senior Secured Notes as a net investment hedge of our European operations. As such, the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the value of the notes is recorded to cumulative translation adjustment. See Note 9, Derivatives and Hedging Activities for further details.

Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes - Other Terms and Conditions
Our Senior Notes contain covenants that will, among other things, limit our ability to create liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. Our Senior Secured Notes and 2024 Senior Unsecured Notes also require that, as a condition precedent to incurring certain types of indebtedness not otherwise permitted, our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as calculated on a pro forma basis, be greater than 2.00, as well as containing restrictions on its operations, including limitations on: (i) incurring additional indebtedness; (ii) paying dividends; (iii) distributions and stock repurchases; (iv) investments; (v) asset sales and (vi) mergers and consolidations.

Subject to limited exceptions, all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes on a joint and several basis. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us.

As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions of these indentures.

Other Debt
We have approximately $106 million of other debt, which consists primarily of foreign debt with maturities of one year or less.

On-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have securitization programs for some of our accounts receivable, with limited recourse provisions. Borrowings on these securitization programs are recorded in short-term debt.

Borrowings on these securitization programs at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

------------------------------------- ----------------- - ---- - --

 As of December 31
 2018 2017
 (Millions)
Borrowings on securitization programs $ 6 $ 30

In the U.S., we had an accounts receivable securitization program with three commercial banks, comprised of a first priority facility and a second priority facility, which we terminated in October 2018. We securitized original equipment and aftermarket receivables on a daily basis under this program. Both facilities monetized accounts receivable generated in the U.S. that met certain eligibility requirements and the second priority facility also monetized certain accounts receivable generated in the U.S. that would otherwise have been ineligible under the first priority securitization facility. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our securitized accounts receivable under this U.S. program was $30 million, recorded in short-term debt, at December 31, 2017.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
On December 14, 2017, we entered into a new accounts receivable factoring program in the U.S. with a commercial bank. Under this program we sell receivables from certain of our U.S. OE customers at a rate that is favorable versus our senior credit facility. This arrangement is uncommitted and provides for cancellation by the commercial bank with no less than 30 days prior written notice. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our accounts receivable sold under this program was $130 million and $107 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The Company has two other receivable factoring programs in the U.S. with commercial banks under which we sell receivables from certain of our aftermarket customers to whom we have extended payment terms. Both arrangements are uncommitted and may be terminated with 10 days prior notice for one program and 30 days prior notice for the other program. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our accounts receivable sold under these programs was $387 million at December 31, 2018.

64

Table of Contents

The Company also has subsidiaries in several countries in Europe that are parties to accounts receivable factoring facilities. The commitments for these arrangements are generally for one year, but some may be canceled with notice 90 days prior to renewal. In some instances, the arrangement provides for cancellation by the applicable financial institution at any time upon notification. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our accounts receivable sold under programs in Europe was $361 million and $218 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

These factoring programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing, and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. If we were not able to factor receivables under either the European or U.S. programs, our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement might increase, although this could be partially mitigated by exercising our right to shorten payment terms with certain of the aftermarket customers whose receivables we sell under the U.S. factoring programs in the event that those factoring programs are terminated.

In the U.S and Canada we participate in supply chain financing programs with certain of our aftermarket customers to whom we have extended payment terms whereby the accounts receivable are satisfied through the early receipt of negotiable financial instruments that are payable at a later date when payments from our customers are due. We sell these financial instruments before their maturity date to various financial institutions at a discount. Such financial instruments sold to financial institutions with outstanding maturity dates totaled $133 million and $81 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

If these drafting programs were terminated or the financial institutions that currently participate in these programs were to reduce their purchases of drafts, our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement might increase, although this could be partially mitigated by exercising our right to shorten payment terms with certain of the aftermarket customers whose drafts we sell under the U.S. and Canadian programs in the event that those programs are terminated or otherwise reduced.

The amounts outstanding for these factoring and drafting arrangements as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:

Supply Chain Financing
Certain of our suppliers participate in supply chain financing programs under which they securitize their accounts receivables from us. Financial institutions participate in the supply chain financing program on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables or drafts from our suppliers at any time. If the financial institutions did not continue to purchase receivables or drafts from our suppliers under these programs, the participating vendors may have a need to renegotiate their payment terms with us which in turn could cause our borrowings under our revolving credit facility to increase.

Capital Requirements
We believe that cash flows from operations, combined with our cash on hand, subject to any applicable withholding taxes upon repatriation of cash balances from our foreign operations where most of our cash balances are located, and available borrowing capacity described above, assuming that we maintain compliance with the financial covenants and other requirements of our senior credit facility agreement, will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements, including debt amortization, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and other operational requirements, for the following year. Our ability to meet the financial covenants depends upon a number of operational and economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. In the event that

65

Table of Contents

we are unable to meet these financial covenants, we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs. Such actions include additional restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions, sales of assets, reductions to working capital and capital spending, reduction or cessation of our share repurchase and dividend programs, issuance of equity and other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position. Should we be required to implement any of these actions to meet our cash flow needs, we believe we can do so in a reasonable time frame.

Cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $78 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The net decrease was primarily the result of:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• cash flows provided by the operations of Federal-Mogul, which was acquired in the fourth quarter, of approximately $234 million, this included a cash outflow of $61 million related to the settlement of a litigation matter that was assumed as part of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition (see Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures for further information);

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• offset by a $88 million outflow in working capital items (excluding changes in working capital of the acquired Federal-Mogul operations);

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in cash payments for interest of $36 million; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• other one-time charges of approximately $180 million, including, among other items, transactional related costs and advisory fees in connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, and an antitrust settlement payment.

Cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $143 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The net increase was primarily the result of:

Capital expenditures were $507 million, $419 million, and $345 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. These capital expenditures were primarily related to investing in new facilities, upgrading existing products, continuing new product launches, and infrastructure and equipment at our facilities (including investments in software-related intangible assets) to support our manufacturing, distribution, and cost reduction efforts. For 2019, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $730 million and $780 million, depending on timing of expenditures, as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities and growth.

Proceeds from deferred purchase price of factored receivables was $174 million, $112 million, and $110 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. This increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 is primarily attributable to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

On October 1, 2018, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $3,400 million as a part of our New Credit Facility entered into in conjunction with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. As a part of this New Credit facility we refinanced the revolving credit agreement and tranche A term loan under the Old Credit facility. In 2018, we paid a dividend of $0.25 per share in each quarter, or $59 million in the aggregate. We also had distributions to noncontrolling interest partners of $51 million.

Table of Contents

Cash flow used in financing activities was $251 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This included borrowings under term loans of $160 million, repayments of term loans of $36 million, and net repayments under revolving lines of credit of $73 million. We also had distributions to noncontrolling interest partners of $64 million.

Cash flow used in financing activities was $86 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This included $529 million borrowings under term loans and $545 million repayment of terms loans. We also had distributions to noncontrolling interest partners of $55 million.

We did not repurchase any shares during 2018. During 2017, we repurchased 2,936,950 shares of our outstanding common stock for $169 million at an average price of $57.57 per share. During 2016, we repurchased 4,182,613 shares of our outstanding common stock for $225 million at an average price of $53.89 per share. Since announcing our share repurchase program in 2015, we have repurchased a total of approximately 11.3 million shares for $607 million, representing 19% of the shares outstanding at that time. In February 2017, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock over the next three years. This amount includes the remaining $112 million amount authorized under earlier repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2018, we had $231 million remaining on the share repurchase authorization. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $0 million at December 31, 2018 and $244 million at December 31, 2017. There was $0 million borrowed under the U.S. accounts receivable securitization programs at both the period ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Dividends on Common Stock
On February 1, 2017, we announced the reinstatement of a quarterly dividend program. In 2018, we paid dividends of $0.25 per share in each of the quarters, or $59 million in the aggregate. In 2017, we paid dividends of $0.25 per share in each of the quarters, or $53 million in the aggregate. While we currently expect that comparable quarterly cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, our dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under the program are subject to continued capital availability, the judgment of our Board of Directors and our continued compliance with the provisions pertaining to the payment of dividends under its debt agreements. Once the contemplated separation of our businesses through a spin-off occurs, each independent company will determine its own dividend policy.

If we do not maintain compliance with the terms of our New Credit Facility or senior notes indentures described above, all amounts under those arrangements could, automatically or at the option of the lenders or other debt holders, become due. Additionally, each of those facilities contains provisions that certain events of default under one facility will constitute a default under the other facility, allowing the acceleration of all amounts due. We currently expects to maintain compliance with the terms of all of our various credit agreements for the foreseeable future.

Table of Contents

Included in our contractual obligations is the amount of interest to be paid on our long-term debt. As our debt structure contains both fixed and variable rate obligations, we have made assumptions in calculating the amount of future interest payments. Interest on our senior notes is calculated using the fixed rates of 5.375% and 5%, respectively. Interest on our variable rate debt is calculated as LIBOR plus the applicable margin in effect at December 31, 2018 for the Eurodollar and Term Loan A loan and prime plus the applicable margin in effect on December 31, 2018 on the prime-based loans. We have assumed that both LIBOR and the prime rate will remain unchanged for the outlying years. See “— Capitalization.”

We have also included an estimate of expenditures required after December 31, 2018 to complete the projects authorized at December 31, 2018, in which we have made substantial commitments in connection with purchasing property, plant and equipment for our operations. For 2019, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $730 million and $780 million.

We have included an estimate of the expenditures necessary after December 31, 2018 to satisfy purchase requirements pursuant to certain ordinary course supply agreements that we have entered into. With respect to our other supply agreements, they generally do not specify the volumes we are required to purchase. In many cases, if any commitment is provided, the agreements state only the minimum percentage of our purchase requirements we must buy from the supplier. As a result, these purchase obligations fluctuate from year-to-year and we are not able to quantify the amount of our future obligations.

We have not included material cash requirements for unrecognized tax benefits or taxes. It is difficult to estimate taxes to be paid as changes in where we generate income can have a significant impact its future tax payments. We have also not included cash requirements for funding pension and postretirement benefit costs. Based upon current estimates, we believe we will be required to make contributions of approximately $97 million to those plans in 2019. Pension and postretirement contributions beyond 2019 will be required but those amounts will vary based upon many factors, including the performance of its pension fund investments during 2019 and future discount rate changes. For additional information relating to the funding of our pension and other postretirement plans, refer to Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we have not included cash requirements for environmental remediation. Based upon current estimates, we believe we will be required to spend approximately $46 million over the next 30 years. However, due to possible modifications in remediation processes and other factors, it is difficult to determine the actual timing of the payments. See “— Environmental and Other Matters.”

We occasionally provide guarantees that could require it to make future payments in the event that the third party primary obligor does not make its required payments. The Company is not required to record a liability for any of these guarantees.

Additionally, we have from time to time issued guarantees for the performance of obligations by some of our subsidiaries, and some of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our debt. All of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee its New Credit Facility and its senior notes on a joint and several basis. The New Credit Facility is also secured by first-priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of up to 66% of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries. As described above, certain of our senior notes are secured by pledges of stock and assets. See Note 23 of the consolidated financial statements of Tenneco Inc., where the Company presents the Supplemental Guarantor Consolidating Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates. Our significant accounting policies have been disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We review goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate goodwill might be impaired. We perform assessments at the reporting unit level. We compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. If the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds the fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired. Our assessment of fair value utilizes a combination of the income approach, market approach, and, in instances where a reporting unit's free cash flows do not support the value of the underlying assets, an asset approach. In our assessment, for reporting units where the free cash flows support the value of the underlying assets, we apply a 75% weighting to the income approach and a 25% weighting to the market approach. Assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis that have the most significant effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units are the weighted average cost of capital and revenue growth-rates.

We have nine reporting units that have goodwill as of December 31, 2018, four of which are as a result of the acquisition of Federal-Mogul. Based on our 2018 annual impairment analysis, each of the five reporting units that have goodwill unrelated to the Federal-Mogul acquisition have at least an excess of 18% between the reporting unit’s fair value and carrying value. Additionally, for the reporting units assessed, sensitivity analyses were completed indicating that a one percent increase in the discount rate, a one percent decrease in the long-term operating margin, or a one percent decrease in the long-term revenue growth rate assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value. Goodwill recorded as a result of our acquisition of Federal-Mogul is based on preliminary estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by us. We will continue to evaluate available information prior to finalization of the amounts and these values may be adjusted in the measurement period.

We will review our trade names and trademarks for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicated the assets might be impaired. We will perform a quantitative assessment of estimating fair values based upon the prospective stream of hypothetical after-tax royalty cost savings discounted at rates that reflect the rates of return appropriate for these intangible assets. The primary, and most sensitive, input utilized in determining fair values of trade names and trademarks is branded product sales. These trademarks and brand names were fair valued as part of our acquisition of Federal-Mogul and are based on preliminary estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by us. While we believe these preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of these assets, we will continue to evaluate available information prior to finalization of the amounts and these values may be adjusted in the measurement period.

Due to the many variables inherent in estimating fair value and the relative size of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the results of our analysis.

Refer to Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information regarding our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Definite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Changes to Expected Useful Lives
We monitor our long-lived and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment indicators on an on-going basis. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized. Even if an impairment charge is not recognized, a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets.

We estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates, and customer commitments. The key factors that affect our estimates are (1) future production estimates; (2) customer preferences and decisions; (3) product pricing; (4) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (5) product life / business retention. Any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values, which could materially affect our future results of operations and financial condition. We believe the projections of

70

Table of Contents

anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company sponsors defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Its defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, mortality rates of participants, expected rates of mortality improvement, and health care cost trend rates.

The approach to establishing the discount rate assumption for both our domestic and international plans is based on high-quality corporate bonds. The weighted-average discount rates used to calculate net periodic benefit cost for 2018 and year-end obligations as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:

------------------------------------------- ---------------- - -------------------- --- -------- --- -

 Pension Benefits Other Postretirement
 U.S. Non-U.S.
 Plans Plans Benefits
Used to calculate net periodic benefit cost 4.1 % 2.4 % 4.2 %
Used to calculate benefit obligations 4.2 % 2.6 % 4.3 %

Our approach to determining expected return on plan asset assumptions evaluates both historical returns as well as estimates of future returns, and is adjusted for any expected changes in the long-term outlook for the equity and fixed income markets and for changes in the composition of pension plan assets. As a result, our estimate of the weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets for all of our pension plans was lowered to 5.2% in 2018 from 5.5% in 2017.

Our pension plans generally do not require employee contributions. Our policy is to fund these pension plans in accordance with applicable domestic and international government regulations. At December 31, 2018, all legal funding requirements had been met.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. The changes in these assumptions have no effect on our funding requirements.

Warranty Reserves
Where we have offered product warranty and also provide for warranty costs. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified on OE products. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims and upon specific warranty issues as they arise. The warranty terms vary but range from one year up to limited lifetime warranties on some of our premium aftermarket products. While we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs, it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values, and net operating losses (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") was enacted into U.S. law, which, among other provisions, lowered the corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018 from the currently applicable 35% rate to a new 21% rate, and implemented significant changes with respect to U.S. tax treatment of earnings originating from outside the U.S. Many of the provisions of TCJA are subject to regulatory interpretation and U.S. state conforming enactment. The TCJA also includes an anti-deferral provision (the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income tax) effective starting in 2018 wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of non-U.S. corporations.

We evaluate our deferred income tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. U.S. GAAP requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a “more likely than not” standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and amount of recent losses, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified.

Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets based on a “more likely than not” threshold. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each tax jurisdiction. We consider the following possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance:

- -----------------------------------------------------------
• Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Taxable income or loss, based on recent results, exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards;

- ----------------------------
• Tax-planning strategies; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the relevant tax law.

The valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions will impact our provision for income taxes until the valuation allowances are released. Our provision for income taxes will include no tax benefit for losses incurred and no tax expense with respect to income generated in these jurisdictions until the respective valuation allowance is eliminated.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY
We are exposed to certain global market risks, including foreign currency exchange risk, commodity price risk, interest rate risk associated with our debt, and equity price risk associated with our share-based compensation awards.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We manufacture and sell our products in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we manufacture and sell our products. We generally try to use natural hedges within our foreign currency activities, including the matching of revenues and costs, to minimize foreign currency risk. Where natural hedges are not in place, we consider managing certain aspects of our foreign currency activities and larger transactions through the use of foreign currency options or forward contracts. Principal currencies hedged have historically included the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Polish zloty, and Mexican peso.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts — We enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third-party trade receivables and payables. In managing our foreign currency exposures, we identify and aggregates existing offsetting positions and then hedge residual exposures through third-party derivative contracts. The gain or loss on these contracts is recorded as foreign currency gains (losses) within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are recorded in "Prepayments and other current assets" or "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts was a net asset position of less than $1 million at December 31, 2018 and a net liability position of less than $1 million at December 31, 2017.

The following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of December 31, 2018 (all of which mature in 2019):

---------------- --------- ---------------------------------- -

 Notional Amountin Foreign Currency

Canadian dollars —Sell (2 )
European euro —Purchase 1
 —Sell (8 )
Polish zloty —Purchase 35
Mexican pesos —Purchase 211
U.S. dollars —Purchase 2
 —Sell (11 )

A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the U.S. relative to all other currencies would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to changes in the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to translation of the results of certain international operations into U.S. dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.

The following table summarizes the amounts of foreign currency translation and transaction losses:

 2018 2017
 (Millions)
Translation gains (losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (134 ) $ 106
Transaction gains (losses) recorded in earnings $ (4 ) $ 1

Senior Secured Notes — We have foreign currency denominated debt, €752 million of which was designated as a net investment hedge in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of ours. As such, an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates will have no effect on earnings. For the portion not designated as a net investment hedge, we have other natural hedges in place that will offset any adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates.

Table of Contents

A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates between the euro and U.S. dollar would increase the amount of cash required to settle the these notes by approximately $122 million as of December 31, 2018.

Commodity Price Risk
Commodity rate price forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices for raw materials including copper, nickel, tin, zinc, and aluminum. The fair value of our commodity price forward contracts was a liability of $2 million on an equivalent notional amount of $27 million as of December 31, 2018. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in commodity prices would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to changes in the fair values of commodity forward contracts.

Interest Rate Risk
Our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are primarily our debt securities. We use our revolving credit facilities to finance our short-term and long-term capital requirements. We pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings. Our long-term capital requirements have been financed with long-term debt with original maturity dates ranging from four to ten years. On December 31, 2018, we had $1.6 billion par value of fixed rate debt and $3.7 billion par value of floating rate debt. Of the fixed rate debt, $476 million is fixed through 2022, $626 million is fixed through 2024, and $500 million is fixed through 2026. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capitalization” earlier in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2018 was about 102% of its book value. A hypothetical one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by about $7 million.

Equity Price Risk
We also utilize an equity swap arrangement to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of our arrangements for deferred compensation and restricted stock unit awards. Gain or losses from changes in the fair value of these equity swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities. We selectively use cash-settled equity swaps to reduce market risk associated with our deferred compensation liabilities. These equity compensation liabilities increase as our stock price increases and decrease as our stock price decreases. In contrast, the value of the swap agreement moves in the opposite direction of these liabilities, allowing us to fix a portion of the liabilities at a certain amount. The fair value of the equity swap agreement was an asset of $4 million related to approximately 250,000 common share equivalents as of December 31, 2018. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in share prices would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to the equity swaps as an offsetting change would be applied to the related deferred compensation liability.

Note 9. Commitments and Contingencies Commitments Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, data centers, land, and colocations with original lease periods expiring between 2019 and 2093. We are committed to pay a portion of the related actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. Certain of these arrangements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions, and we recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.

[" or the “Federal-Mogul Acquisition”) pursuant to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 10, 2018 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among us, Federal-Mogul, American Entertainment Properties Corp. (“AEP”) and Icahn Enterprises L.P. (“IEP”). Total consideration was approximately $3.7 billion. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

As a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, the number of our reportable segments increased from three to five segments, consisting of: our historical Clean Air, Ride Performance, and Aftermarket segments and the newly acquired Powertrain and Motorparts segments. Segment information for periods prior to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition do not include amounts for the Federal-Mogul operations.

Our reportable segments, which are also our operating segments, align with how the Chief Operating Decision Maker allocates resources and assesses performance against our key growth strategies. We evaluate segment performance based primarily on earnings before interest expense, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA including noncontrolling interests).

Financial Executive Summary

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We reported total revenue for 2018 of $11,763 million, up 27% from $9,274 million in 2017. The Federal-Mogul acquisition increased revenues by approximately $1,886 million, or 20%, in 2018. The remaining increase in our revenues of $603 million, or 7%, was driven by the growth in Clean Air and Ride Performance segments. Excluding the impact of currency and substrate sales, organic revenue was up $292 million, or 4%, from $7,087 million to $7,379 million, which was driven primarily by stronger light vehicle volumes, higher commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenues and new platforms.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and noncontrolling interests (EBIT) was $306 million for 2018, a decrease of $102 million, when compared to $408 million in 2017. Excluding the Federal-Mogul acquisition, EBIT decreased compared to 2017, as higher light vehicle volumes, increased commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle revenues and new platforms were more than offset by unfavorable mix, price reductions, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher restructuring and related expenses, costs related to the Acquisition and expected spin, loss on extinguishment of debt, a litigation settlement charge, and continued investments in growth for new programs. EBIT in 2017 also included a $132 million antitrust settlement accrual, a $11 million goodwill impairment charge and $13 million in charges related to pension derisking and the acceleration of restricted stock vesting. See “Segment Results of Operations” for further information on EBIT including noncontrolling interests.

Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2018, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon 78 transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2018, there were 2,385 million shares and 469 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Share Repurchase Program Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date. During the second quarter of 2018, we completed repurchases under the original authorization to purchase up to $6.0 billion of our Class A common stock. In April 2018, the authorization for the repurchase of our Class A common stock was increased by an additional $9.0 billion, and we completed repurchases under this authorization during the fourth quarter of 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased and subsequently retir...

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...

Note 8. Securitization Activities Jefferies Group engages in securitization activities related to corporate loans, commercial mortgage loans, consumer loans and mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. In securitization transactions, Jefferies Group transfers assets to special purpose entities ("SPEs") and acts as the placement or structuring agent for the beneficial interests sold to investors by the SPE. A significant portion of the securitization transactions are the securitization of assets issued or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. These SPEs generally meet the criteria of VIEs; however, the SPEs are generally not consolidated as Jefferies Group is not considered the primary beneficiary for these SPEs. F-47 Jefferies Group accounts for securitization transactions as sales, provided it has relinquished control over the transferred assets. Transferred assets are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal transactions revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations prior to the identification and isolation for securitization. Subsequently, revenues recognized upon securitization are reflected as net underwriting revenues. Jefferies Group generally receives cash proceeds in connection with the transfer of assets to an SPE. Jefferies Group may, however, have continuing involvement with the transferred assets, which is limited to retaining one or more tranches of the securitization (primarily senior and subordinated debt securities in the form of mortgage- and other asset-backed securities or CLOs), which are included in Trading assets and are generally initially categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Jefferies Group applies fair value accounting to the securities. The following table presents activity related to Jefferies Group's securitizations that were accounted for as sales in which it had continuing involvement (in millions): ----------------------------------------- --------------------...

These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates. Our significant accounting policies have been disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We review goodwill for impairment annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate goodwill might be impaired. We perform assessments at the reporting unit level. We compare the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. If the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds the fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired. Our assessment of fair value utilizes a combination of the income approach, market approach, and, in instances where a reporting unit']:
