Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Critical Accounting Policies
The Company follows accounting and reporting policies and procedures that conform, in all material respects, to GAAP and to practices generally applicable to the financial services industry, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments and accounting estimates that affect the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, and amounts disclosed as contingent assets and liabilities. While the Company bases estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures that are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgment and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the Company's most critical accounting policies and accounting estimates, which have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the Board of Directors, as follows:
Investment Securities
Under ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, investment securities must be classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading. Management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase. The classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities. Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the Company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses, net of tax, reported in AOCI and do not affect earnings until realized unless a decline in fair value below amortized cost is considered to be OTTI.
The fair values of the Company’s securities are generally determined by reference to quoted prices from reliable independent third party sources and pricing services utilizing observable inputs. Certain of the Company’s fair values of securities may be determined by third party source and pricing services that may use models whose significant value drivers or assumptions may be unobservable and are significant to the fair value of the securities. These models are utilized when quoted prices are not available for certain securities or in markets where trading activity has slowed or ceased. When quoted prices are not available and are not provided by third party sources or pricing services, management judgment is necessary to determine fair value. As such, fair value is determined using discounted cash flow analysis models, incorporating default rates, estimation of prepayment characteristics and implied volatilities.
The Company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations, for determining if OTTI exists pursuant to guidelines established in ASC 320. In evaluating the possible impairment of securities, consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the ability and intent of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, the Company may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies or government sponsored agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer’s financial condition.
If management determines that an investment experienced an OTTI, management must then determine the amount of the OTTI to be recognized in earnings. If management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss, the OTTI will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of OTTI related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings. The amount of the OTTI related to other factors will be recognized in AOCI, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment. If management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss, the OTTI will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment’s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. Any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain (as AOCI in stockholders’ equity) and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold.
The Company may, from time to time, dispose of an impaired security in response to asset/liability management decisions, future market movements, business plan changes, or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The allowance for loan and lease losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense, and represents management’s best estimate of probable losses that may be incurred within the existing loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The Company performs an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance at least on a quarterly basis. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan and lease loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the Company’s control, including performance of the Company’s loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates, and regulatory authorities altering their loan classification guidance.
The allowance consists of three elements: (i) specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on impaired loans and leases; (ii) quantitative valuation allowances calculated using loss experience for like loans and leases with similar characteristics and trends, adjusted, as necessary to reflect the impact of current conditions; and (iii) qualitative allowances based on economic and other factors that may be internal or external to the Company.
Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Accounting guidance requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a “more likely than not” standard.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management evaluates both positive and negative evidence on a quarterly basis, including the reversal of its taxable temporary differences, the existence of its historical earnings, the amounts of future projected earnings as well as the tax expiration periods of its income tax credits.
Alternative Energy Partnerships
The Company invests in certain alternative energy partnerships (limited liability companies) formed to provide sustainable energy projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits (energy tax credits) and other tax benefits. The Company is a limited partner in these partnerships, which were formed to invest in newly installed residential rooftop solar leases and power purchase agreements.
As the Company’s respective investments in these entities are more than minor, the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the investee’s activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. As a result, the Company is required to apply the equity method of accounting, which generally prescribes applying the percentage ownership interest to the investee’s GAAP net income in order to determine the investor’s earnings or losses in a given period. However, because the liquidation rights, tax credit allocations and other benefits to investors can change upon the occurrence of specified events, application of the equity method based on the underlying ownership percentages would not accurately represent the Company’s investment. As a result, the Company applies the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) method of the equity method of accounting. The HLBV method is a balance sheet approach where a calculation is prepared at each balance sheet date to estimate the amount that the Company would receive if the equity investment entity were to liquidate all of its assets (as valued in accordance with GAAP) and distribute that cash to the investors based on the contractually defined liquidation priorities. The difference between the calculated liquidation distribution amounts at the beginning and the end of the reporting period, after adjusting for capital contributions and distributions, is the Company’s share of the earnings or losses from the equity investment for the period.
To account for the tax credits earned on investments in alternative energy partnerships, the Company uses the flow-through income statement method. Under this method, the tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense and the initial book-tax differences in the basis of the investments are recognized as additional tax expense in the year they are earned. The Company does not believe the investments in alternative energy partnerships are impaired by the lower corporate income tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act due to the protective provision built into the partnership agreements. However, the Company expects to take longer to utilize the investment tax credits generated from these investments.

Financial Highlights
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, net income from continuing operations was $42.1 million, $53.5 million and $86.7 million, respectively. Diluted earnings from continuing operations per total common share were $0.38, $0.63 and $1.34, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was mainly due to decreases in net interest income, noninterest income and income tax benefit and an increase in provision for loan and lease losses, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. The decrease in net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was mainly due to increases in noninterest expense and provision for loan and lease losses and decreases in noninterest income and net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense.
Total assets were $10.63 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $302.2 million, or 2.9 percent, from $10.33 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly due to an increase in loans and leases held-for-investment partially offset by a decrease in investment securities.
Significant financial highlights include:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Securities available-for-sale were $1.99 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $583.0 million, or 22.6 percent, from $2.58 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a net decline in collateralized loan obligations due to call and sale activities and a decrease in commercial mortgage-backed-securities due to sales. The Company continued shrinking the amount of collateralized loan obligations in the investment securities portfolio and repositioned its securities available-for-sale portfolio to navigate a volatile rate environment by reducing the overall duration of the portfolio by selling longer-duration corporate debt securities and commercial mortgage-backed-securities. The sales of securities served to remix overall assets and the proceeds therefrom were primarily used to fund loan originations.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Loans and leases receivable, net of ALLL, were $7.70 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.04 billion, or 15.6 percent, from $6.66 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly due to originations partially offset by an increase of $12.9 million in the ALLL and the sale of SFR mortgage loan pools during the year ended December 31, 2018.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total deposits were $7.92 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $623.7 million, or 8.6 percent, from $7.29 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly due to the Company's continuous efforts to build core deposits across the Company's business units, including strong growth from the community banking and private banking channel and increased brokered deposits.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total stockholders' equity was $945.5 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $66.8 million, or 6.6 percent, from $1.01 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of the redemption of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock for an aggregate amount of $40.3 million, $45.5 million of cash dividends on common stock and preferred stock and $29.8 million of other comprehensive loss on securities available-for-sale primarily due to increases in market interest rates, partially offset by net income of $45.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

For the quarters ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, net income from continuing operations was $10.8 million, $10.9 million and $24.5 million, respectively. Diluted earnings from continuing operations per total common share were $0.12, $0.11 and $0.36, respectively, for the quarters ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in net income from continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was mainly due to decreases in net interest income, noninterest income and income tax benefit and an increase in provision for loan and lease losses, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense. The decrease in net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was mainly due to a decrease in net interest income, an increase in provision for loan and lease losses and a decrease in noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense.

(1) Total loans and leases includes income from discontinued operations.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017
Net interest income was $286.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $24.5 million, or 7.9 percent, from $311.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net interest income from the prior year was due to higher average cost of interest-bearing liabilities and lower average balances of securities, partially offset by higher average yields from interest-earning assets and higher average balances of total loans and lower average balances of long term debt and other interest-bearing liabilities.
Interest income on total loans and leases was $329.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $41.8 million, or 14.5 percent, from $288.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest income on total loans and leases was due to a $577.5 million increase in average total loans and leases and a 23 bps increase in average yield. The increase in average balance was due mainly to increased loan originations, partially offset by the sales of the Banc Home Loans division during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in average yield was mainly due to higher interest rates on new loans and loans with variable interest rates from a rising interest rate environment, partially offset by a decrease of seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools, the discounts of which generated additional interest income of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Interest income on securities was $83.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $16.2 million, or 16.2 percent, from $99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in interest income on securities was due to a $705.7 million decrease in average balance, partially offset by a 34 bps increase in average yield. The decrease in average balance was mainly due to sales of certain longer-duration and fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt securities to navigate a volatile rate environment during 2017 and 2018 and reposition our earning assets from investment securities to loans. The increase in average yield was due to higher interest rates on newly purchased investment securities and
investment securities with variable interest rates from a rising interest rate environment.

The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense, primarily due to an increase in the average rates paid, on interest-bearing liabilities and a decrease in interest income earned on total loans and leases, primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of loans and leases, partially offset by higher interest income from securities.
Interest income on total loans and leases was $288.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $8.9 million, or 3.0 percent, from $297.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest income on total loans and leases was due to a $249.8 million decrease in average total loans and leases, partially offset by a 3 bps increase in average yield. Ending balance of total loans and leases increased during the year ended December 31, 2017; however, the average balance decreased as the ending balance increased, which was mainly driven by a larger increase during the three months ended December 31, 2017. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, total loans and leases decreased by $403.4 million to $6.34 billion due mainly to the sale of the Banc Home Loans division during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the sale of seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools during the three months ended September 30, 2017. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, total loans and leases increased by $429.2 million to $6.77 billion due mainly to higher loan production in commercial loans. Year-over-year, total loans and leases increased by$25.8 million, or 0.4 percent, to $6.77 billion at December 31, 2017 from $6.74 billion at December 31, 2016.

Such discount accretion totaled $4.8 million and $36.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses
Provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to operations at a level required to reflect incurred credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Company recorded $30.2 million, $13.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to its provision for loan and lease losses.
The increase in provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was mainly due to a $12.5 million increase in net charge offs during the year, 15.6 percent incremental growth in the loan and lease portfolio from the prior year, an increase in classified loans of 97.8 percent and methodology enhancements implemented throughout the year ended December 31, 2018, such as extension of look-back period, enhancements of qualitative adjustments and loan segmentation, and annual update of the loss emergence period. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a charge-off of $13.9 million, which reflected the outstanding balance under a $15.0 million line of credit that was originated during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Subsequent to the granting of the line of credit, representations from the borrower in applying for the line of credit were determined by the Bank to be false, and third party bank account statements provided by the borrower to secure the line of credit were found to be fraudulent. The line of credit was granted after the borrower appeared to have satisfied a pre-condition that the line of credit be fully cash collateralized and secured by a bank account at a third party financial institution pledged to the Bank. As part of the Bank’s

credit review and portfolio management process, the line of credit and disbursements were reviewed subsequent to closing and compliance with the borrower’s covenants was monitored. As part of this process, on March 9, 2018, the Bank received information that caused it to believe the existence of the pledged bank account had been misrepresented by the borrower and that the account had previously been closed. The Bank filed an action in federal court pursuing the borrower and other parties and is also considering other available sources of collection and other potential means of mitigating the loss; however, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in this regard. Upon extensive review of the underwriting process for this loan, the Bank determined that this loan was the result of an isolated event of external fraud.
The increase in provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was mainly driven by a $4.5 million increase in net charge offs during the year, as well as 10 percent incremental growth in the loan and lease portfolio from the prior year.

Amortization of intangible assets was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $921 thousand, or 23.4 percent, from $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to scheduled amortization during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Restructuring expenses were $4.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $895 thousand, or 16.8 percent, from $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Restructuring expenses from severance related costs from a reduction in workforce during the year ended December 31, 2018 were lower than restructuring expenses from realigning back office staffing and amending certain system contracts precipitated from the sale of the Banc Home Loans division during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Other expenses were $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $17.2 million, or 52.9 percent, from $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to the Company's effort to manage its expenses from supplies, business travel, and other administrative expenditures, coupled with a decrease in provision for unfunded loan commitments, and insurance recoveries from previous legal settlement expenses.
Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
Noninterest expense was $308.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $5.1 million, or 1.7 percent, from $303.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly due to increases in professional fees, occupancy and equipment, all other expenses, a decrease in reversal of provision for loan repurchases, and the recognition of restructuring expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by decreases in salaries and employee benefits, outside service fees, and advertising expense.
Salaries and employee benefits were $129.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $17.0 million, or 11.6 percent, from $146.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in salaries and overtime, bonus accruals including a reversal during 2017 of an excess bonus accrual in 2016, and stock compensation expense, partially offset by increases in temporary staff and vacation accrual, a decrease in direct loan origination cost, and certain severance payments during the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the Company accrued a liability for estimated discretionary incentive compensation payments to certain employees. The amount paid was less than the accrued liability. Consequently, the Company reversed the excess accrual and recorded a credit to salaries and employee benefits on the consolidated statements of operations of $7.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The reversal, based on new information driven by changes to certain facts and circumstances, was determined to be a change in estimate.
Occupancy and equipment expenses were $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $3.6 million, or 10.3 percent, from $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly due to increased building and maintenance costs.
Professional fees were $42.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.0 million, or 39.7 percent, from $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly due to expenses related to the special committee investigation, pending SEC investigation, various other litigation and increased audit fees.
Outside service fees were $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 16.4 percent, from $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in loan sub-servicing expenses resulting from sales of seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools, partially offset by an increase in recruiting expense.
Data processing expenses were $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $423 thousand, or 5.1 percent, from $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to a decreased volume of transactions from lower deposit balances.
Advertising costs were $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 22.9 percent, from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in marketing and advertising expenses as part of the Company's effort to reduce overhead cost.
Regulatory assessments were $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $81 thousand, or 1.0 percent, from $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's year-over-year balance sheet change was immaterial.

Loss on investments in alternative energy partnerships of $30.8 million and $31.5 million, was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company invests in certain alternative energy partnerships formed to provide sustainable energy projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits. The Company recognized federal tax credits of $38.2 million and $33.4 million, respectively, as well as income tax benefits relating to the recognition of its loss on investments in alternative energy partnerships during the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Reversal for loan repurchases was $1.8 million and $3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which reflect subsequent changes in the reserve for loss on repurchased loans. The Company recorded initial provisions for loan repurchases of $1.6 million and $3.9 million related to new loan sales against income from discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total provision (reversal) for loan repurchases provided to reserve for loss on repurchased loans was $(190) thousand and $590 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the initial provision was mainly due to a decrease in volume of loans sold and the decrease in provision for loan repurchases in noninterest expense was due to the lower reserve requirement compared to the preceding period.
Amortization of intangible assets was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $923 thousand, or 19.0 percent, from $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to impairment of the customer relationship intangible with no new intangible assets recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017.
Impairment of intangible assets of $336 thousand and $690 thousand was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also wrote off a customer relationship intangible of $246 thousand and a trade name intangible of $90 thousand related to RenovationReady. RenovationReady was acquired in 2014 and provided specialized loan services to financial institutions and mortgage bankers that originate agency eligible residential renovation and construction loan products. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company ceased to use the CS Financial trade name and wrote off the related trade name intangible of $690 thousand. CS Financial is a mortgage banking firm that the Bank acquired in 2013.
The Company recognized restructuring expenses of $5.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. In connection with the sale of the Banc Home Loans division and additional cost reduction initiatives, the Company restructured certain aspects of its infrastructure and back office operations by realigning back office staffing and amending certain system contracts in order to improve the Company's efficiency.
Other expenses were $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.8 million, or 17.2 percent, from $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was mainly due to a legal settlement accrual of $5.7 million and a loss from the equity method accounting on CRA investments of $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, and increases in aggregate director fees due to the increase in the number of outside directors as part of the Company's corporate governance enhancements, loan related expense, reserve for unfunded loan commitments due to the increased loan volume and impairments on previously capitalized software projects, partially offset by $2.7 million in expense for the redemption of the Company's 7.50 percent senior notes due April 15, 2020 during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Income Tax Expense
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, income tax expense (benefit) of continuing operations was $4.8 million, $(26.6) million and $13.7 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was 10.3 percent, (98.8) percent and 13.7 percent, respectively.
The Company’s effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 mainly due to the reduction in the recognition of tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships, which were $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The reduction in tax credits received by the Bank on the investments in alternative energy partnerships is due to less new equipment being placed into service by the investments. The Company uses the flow-through income statement method to account for the tax credits earned on investments in alternative energy partnership. Under this method, the tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense and the initial book-tax difference in the basis of the investments are recognized as additional tax expense in the year they are earned. Also, in 2017 the Company recognized a $2.1 million net tax benefit as a result of re-measurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. The higher effective tax rate in 2018 was partially offset by a decrease in the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which became effective January 1, 2018.

Discontinued Operations
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of the Banc Home Loans division, which largely represented the Company's Mortgage Banking segment. In accordance with ASC 205-20, the Company determined that the sale of the Banc Home Loans division and certain other mortgage banking related assets and liabilities that were to be sold or settled separately within one year met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation and its operating results and financial condition have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Certain components of the Company’s Mortgage Banking segment, including MSRs on certain conventional government SFR mortgage loans that were not sold as part of the Banc Home Loans sale and repurchase reserves related to previously sold loans, have been classified as continuing operations in the financial statements, as they will continue to be part of the Company’s ongoing operations.
The Banc Home Loans division originated conforming SFR mortgage loans and sold those loans in the secondary market. The amount of net revenue on mortgage banking activities was a function of mortgage loans originated for sale and the fair value adjustments of these loans and related derivatives. Net revenue on mortgage banking activities included mark to market pricing adjustments on loan commitments and forward sales contracts, and initial capitalized value of MSRs. For additional information, see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017
Net income from discontinued operations was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $910 thousand, or 21.5 percent, from $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Diluted earnings from discontinued operations per total common share were $0.07 and $0.08 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Interest income from discontinued operations was $665 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $6.4 million, or 90.6 percent, from $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in average balance of loans held-for-sale of discontinued operations.
Noninterest income from discontinued operations was $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $56.0 million, or 93.2 percent, from $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in net revenue from discontinued operations in the 2018 period.
Noninterest expense from discontinued operations was $136 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $59.9 million, or 99.8 percent, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Noninterest expense decreased significantly as the Company wound down the mortgage banking activities in discontinued operations.
Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
Net income from discontinued operations was $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $24.4 million, or 85.2 percent, from $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted earnings from discontinued operations per total common share were $0.08 and $0.60 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Interest income from discontinued operations was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $8.1 million, or 53.4 percent, from $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in average balance of loans held-for-sale of discontinued operations.
Noninterest income from discontinued operations was $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $113.1 million, or 65.3 percent, from $173.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in loan servicing income and net revenue on mortgage banking activities, partially offset by a net gain on disposal of discontinued operations of $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decreases in loan servicing income and net revenue on mortgage banking activities were mainly due to the discontinued operations of mortgage banking activities. The Company originated conforming SFR mortgage loans of $1.53 billion and $5.14 billion, respectively, and sold $1.88 billion and $5.13 billion, respectively, in the secondary market during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Noninterest expense from discontinued operations was $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $79.5 million, or 57.0 percent, from $139.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to the
discontinued operations of mortgage banking activities, partially offset by a restructuring expense of $3.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2017. In connection with the sale of Banc Home Loans division, the Company restructured certain aspects
of its infrastructure and back office operations by realigning back office staffing and amending certain system contracts.

Financial Condition

Investment Securities
Investment securities that the Company has the ability and the intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. All
other securities are classified as available-for-sale. Investment securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized
cost. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at their estimated fair values with the changes in fair
values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as a component of stockholders’ equity. At
December 31, 2018, all of the Company’s investment securities were classified as available-for-sale.
The primary goal of our investment securities portfolio is to provide a relatively stable source of interest income while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Certain investment securities provide a source of liquidity as collateral for FHLB advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window capacity, repurchase agreements and for certain public deposits.
The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of the investment securities portfolio and the corresponding amounts of gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of the dates indicated:

During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company evaluated its securities held-to-maturity and determined that certain securities no longer adhered to the Company’s strategic focus and could be sold or reinvested to potentially improve the

Company’s liquidity position or duration profile. Accordingly, the Company was no longer able to assert that it had the intent to hold these securities until maturity. As a result, the Company transferred all $740.9 million of its held-to-maturity securities to available-for-sale, which resulted in a pre-tax increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of $22.0 million at the time of the transfer, which occurred before June 30, 2017. Due to the transfer, the Company’s ability to assert that it has both the intent and ability to hold debt securities to maturity will be limited for the foreseeable future.
Securities available-for-sale were $1.99 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $583.0 million, or 22.6 percent, from $2.58 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to sales of $406.8 million, principal payments of $43.4 million, and calls and pay-offs of $607.6 million, partially offset by purchases of $521.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Securities available-for-sale had a net unrealized loss of $34.2 million at December 31, 2018 and a net unrealized gain of $8.1 million at December 31, 2017, respectively.
The Company repositioned its securities available-for-sale portfolio during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to navigate a volatile rate environment by reducing the overall duration of the portfolio by selling certain longer-duration and fixed-rate non-agency mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt securities and continued shrinking the amount of collateralized loan obligations in the investment securities portfolio. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of all remaining corporate debt securities, totaling $76.8 million, to reposition its securities available-for-sale portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the balance of collateralized loan obligations declined by $280.8 million due primarily to call and sale activities, partially offset by purchase activities. The net proceeds from the sale of securities and the run-off in collateralized loan obligations were redeployed to support loan growth.
CLOs totaled $1.42 billion and $1.70 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. CLOs are floating rate debt securities backed by pools of senior secured commercial loans to a diverse group of companies across a broad spectrum of industries. Underlying loans are generally secured by a company’s assets such as inventory, equipment, property, and/or real estate. CLOs are structured to diversify exposure to a broad sector of industries. The payments on these commercial loans support interest and principal on the CLOs across classes that range from AAA rated to equity tranches. The Company believes that its CLO portfolio, consisting entirely of variable rate securities, supports the Company’s interest rate risk management strategy by lowering the extension risk and duration risk inherent to certain fixed rate investment securities. At December 31, 2018, the Company owned AAA and AA rated CLOs and did not own CLOs rated below AA. As all CLOs are also rated above investment grade credit ratings and were diversified across issuers, the Company believes that these CLOs enhance the Company's liquidity position. The Company also maintains pre-purchase due diligence and ongoing review processes by a dedicated credit administration team. The ongoing review process includes monitoring of performance factors including external credit ratings, collateralization levels, collateral concentration levels and other performance factors. The Company only acquires CLOs that it believes are Volcker Rule compliant.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company changed its intent to sell its non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in an unrealized loss position due to its strategy to reposition its securities profile and recognized $3.3 million of OTTI for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company did not record OTTI for investment securities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. As of December 31, 2018, all of the Company's investment securities in an unrealized loss position had received an investment grade credit rating.

Loans Held-for-Sale
Total loans held-for-sale on consolidated operations basis, including discontinued operations, were $27.6 million and $105.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Loans held-for-sale consisted of two components: loans held-for-sale carried at fair value and loans held-for-sale carried at lower of cost or fair value.
As of December 31, 2018, loans held-for-sale carried at fair value are mainly repurchased conforming SFR mortgage loans that were previously sold. As of December 31, 2017, loans held-for-sale carried at fair value were mainly repurchased
conforming SFR mortgage loans that were previously sold and loans previously sold to GNMA that are delinquent more than
90 days and subject to a repurchase option by the Company. Loans held-for-sale carried at fair value on a consolidated operations basis were $27.2 million and $105.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The $78.1 million, or 74.2 percent, decrease was mainly due to a net decrease of $66.0 million in GNMA loans delinquent more than 90 days, which were subject to a repurchase option held by the Company, which option was eliminated as a result of the sale of the related MSRs to third parties during 2018. The decrease was also a result of loan sales of $14.5 million, partially offset by loan repurchases of $12.7 million.
During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Banc Home Loans division, which largely represented the Company's Mortgage Banking segment, and determined that the sale of the Mortgage Banking segment met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation. Loans held-for-sale carried at fair value related to the Banc Home Loans division were included in Assets of Discontinued Operations on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Such loans totaled $19.5 million and $38.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Loans held-for-sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value are mainly non-conforming jumbo mortgage loans and SBA loans. Loans held-for-sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value on a consolidated operations basis were $426 thousand and $466 thousand, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company transferred all of its seasoned SFR mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal amount and aggregate carrying value of $168.3 million and $147.9 million, respectively, to loans held-for-sale in order to improve the credit quality of the loan portfolio and provide additional liquidity. The Company transferred these loans at the lower of cost or fair value and recorded a fair value adjustment of $1.8 million against its ALLL. All of these loans were sold during the three months ended September 30, 2017. On the date of sale, the aggregate unpaid principal balance and aggregate carrying value were $165.7 million and $144.2 million, respectively, and the Company recognized a gain on sale of $4.7 million.

Total loans and leases were $7.70 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 15.6 percent, from $6.66 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly due to increases in multifamily loans, SFR mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and construction loans, partially offset by decreases in other consumer loans, SBA loans, and lease financing. The increases in multifamily loans, commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and construction loans were mainly due to increased originations. The increase in SFR mortgage loans was mainly due to the $59.5 million of loans purchased to assist the Company in complying with its CRA requirements and increased originations, partially offset by loans transferred to loans held-for-sale of $377.0 million. The decreases in other consumer loans and lease financing was mainly due to reductions in principal balances and payoffs. See "Loan and Lease Originations, Purchases and Repayments" for the origination detail per loan and lease category.

Seasoned SFR Mortgage Loan Pools
The Company did not have any outstanding seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools at December 31, 2018 or 2017.
During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Company transferred all of its seasoned SFR mortgage loans, which had an aggregate unpaid principal balance and an aggregate carrying value of $168.3 million and $147.9 million, respectively, to loans held-for-sale in order to improve the credit quality of the loan portfolio and provide additional liquidity. The Company transferred these loans at lower of cost or fair value and recorded a fair value adjustment of $1.8 million against its ALLL. This
transfer included PCI loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance and aggregate carrying value of $147.5 million and $128.4 million, respectively, and recorded a fair value adjustment of $274 thousand. All of these loans were sold during the
three months ended September 30, 2017. On the date of sale settlement, the aggregate unpaid principal balance and aggregate
carrying value were $165.7 million and $144.2 million, respectively, and the Company recognized a gain on sale of $4.7 million. The Company sold seasoned SFR mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance and aggregate carrying value of $766.0 million and $707.4 million respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016, and the Company recognized a gain on sale of $24.7 million.
At December 31, 2016, the total unpaid principal balance and carrying value of the seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools were $177.1 million and $155.2 million, respectively. At the time of purchase, the Company determined that certain of these loans reflected credit quality deterioration since origination and it was probable that all contractually required payments would not be collected (Purchased Credit Impaired Loans, or PCI loans). Total unpaid principal balance and carrying value of PCI loans included in these pools were $153.9 million and $133.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. These PCI loans were sold as part of the loan sales in 2017 described above.
The Company did not purchase any seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools during the year ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company completed one seasoned SFR mortgage loan pool acquisition with unpaid principal balances and fair values of $103.8 million and $91.0 million, respectively, at the acquisition date. The Company determined that all of the loans in this seasoned SFR mortgage loan acquisition reflected credit quality deterioration since origination and it was probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments would not be collected.

Non-Traditional Mortgage Portfolio
The Company’s non-traditional mortgage (NTM) portfolio is comprised of three interest only products: Green Loans, fixed or adjustable rate hybrid interest only rate mortgage (Interest Only) loans and a small number of additional loans with the potential for negative amortization. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the NTM loans totaled $826.7 million, or 10.7 percent of total loans and leases, and $806.9 million, or 12.1 percent of total loans and leases, respectively. Total NTM portfolio increased by $19.8 million, or 2.5 percent, during the period. The following table presents the composition of the NTM portfolio as of the dates indicated:

The initial credit guidelines for the NTM portfolio were established based on borrower Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score, LTV ratio, property type, occupancy type, loan amount, and geography. Additionally, from an ongoing credit risk management perspective, the Company has determined the most significant performance indicators for NTMs to be LTV ratios and FICO scores. On a quarterly basis, the Company performs loan reviews of the NTM loan portfolio, which includes refreshing FICO scores on the Green Loans and HELOCs and ordering third party automated valuation models (AVMs) to confirm collateral values.

Green Loans
The Company discontinued the origination of Green Loan products in 2011. Green Loans are SFR first and second mortgage
lines of credit with a linked checking account that allows all types of deposits and withdrawals to be performed. The loans are
generally interest only with a 15-year balloon payment due at maturity. The Company initiated the Green Loan products in
2005 and proactively refined underwriting and credit management practices and credit guidelines in response to changing
economic environments, competitive conditions and portfolio performance. The Company continues to manage credit risk, to
the extent possible, throughout the borrower’s credit cycle.
At December 31, 2018, Green Loans totaled $70.1 million, a decrease of $15.6 million, or 18.2 percent from $85.8 million at December 31, 2017, primarily due to reductions in principal balance and payoffs. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, none of the Company’s Green Loans were non-performing. As a result of their unique payment feature, Green Loans possess higher credit risk due to the potential of negative amortization; however, management believes the risk is mitigated through the Company’s loan terms and underwriting standards, including its policies on loan-to-value ratios and the Company’s contractual ability to curtail loans when the value of underlying collateral declines.

Green Loans are similar to HELOCs in that they are collateralized primarily by the equity in the borrower's home. However, some Green Loans differ from HELOCs relating to certain characteristics including one-action laws. Similar to Green Loans, HELOCs allow the borrower to draw down on the credit line based on an established loan amount for a period of time, typically 10 years, requiring an interest only payment with an option to pay principal at any time. A typical HELOC provides that at the end of the term the borrower can continue to make monthly principal and interest payments based on the loan balance until the maturity date. The Green Loan is an interest only loan with a maturity of 15 years, at which time the loan becomes due and payable with a balloon payment at maturity. The unique payment structure also differs from a traditional HELOC in that payments are made through the direct linkage of a personal checking account to the loan through a nightly sweep of funds into the Green Loan Account. This reduces any outstanding balance on the loan by the total amount deposited into the checking account. As a result, every time a deposit is made, effectively a payment to the Green Loan is made. HELOCs typically do not cause the loan to be paid down by a borrower’s depositing of funds into their checking account at the same bank.

Credit guidelines for Green Loans were established based on borrower FICO scores, property type, occupancy type, loan amount, and geography. Property types include single family residences and second trust deeds where the Company held the first liens, owner occupied as well as non-owner occupied properties. The Company utilized its underwriting guidelines for first liens to underwrite the Green Loan secured by second trust deeds as if the combined loans were a single Green Loan. For all Green Loans, the loan income was underwritten using either full income documentation or alternative income documentation.
Interest Only Loans
Interest only loans are primarily SFR mortgage loans with payment features that allow interest only payment in initial periods before converting to a fully amortizing loan. Interest only loans totaled $753.1 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $35.6 million, or 5.0 percent, from $717.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to originations of $252.8 million, partially offset by paydowns and amortization of $143.4 million and loans transferred to held-for-sale of $73.8 million. As of December 31, 2018, all of these loans held for sale were sold. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $0 and $1.2 million of the Interest only loans were non-performing, respectively.
Loans with the Potential for Negative Amortization
Negative amortization loans decreased by $146 thousand, or 4.0 percent, to $3.5 million as of December 31, 2018 from $3.7 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company discontinued origination of negative amortization loans in 2007. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, none of the loans with the potential for negative amortization were non-performing. These loans pose a potentially higher credit risk because of the lack of principal amortization and potential for negative amortization. However, management believes the risk is mitigated through the loan terms and underwriting standards, including the Company’s policies on LTV ratios.

Non-Traditional Mortgage Loan Credit Risk Management
The Company performs detailed reviews of collateral values on loans collateralized by residential real property included in its NTM portfolio based on appraisals or estimates from third party AVMs to analyze property value trends periodically. AVMs are used to identify loans that have experienced potential collateral deterioration. Once a loan has been identified that may have experienced collateral deterioration, the Company will obtain updated drive by or full appraisals in order to confirm the valuation. This information is used to update key monitoring metrics such as LTV ratios. Additionally, FICO scores are obtained in conjunction with the collateral analysis. In addition to LTV ratios and FICO scores, the Company evaluates the portfolio on a specific loan basis through delinquency and portfolio charge-offs to determine whether any risk mitigation or portfolio management actions are warranted. The borrowers may be contacted as necessary to discuss material changes in loan performance or credit metrics.
The Company’s risk management policy and credit monitoring includes reviewing delinquency, FICO scores, and LTV ratios on the NTM loan portfolio. The Company also continuously monitors market conditions for our geographic lending areas. The Company has determined that the most significant performance indicators for NTM are LTV ratios and FICO scores. The loan review provides an effective method of identifying borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulty before they fail to make a loan payment. Upon receipt of the updated FICO scores, an exception report is run to identify loans with a decrease in FICO score of 10 percent or more and a resulting FICO score of 620 or less. The loans are then further analyzed to determine if the risk rating should be downgraded, which may require an increase in the ALLL the Company needs to establish for potential losses. A report is prepared and regularly monitored.
The Company proactively manages the portfolio by performing a detailed analysis with emphasis on the non-traditional mortgage portfolio. The Company conducts regular meetings to review the loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful and determines whether suspension or reduction in credit limit is warranted. If the line has been suspended and the borrower would like to have their credit privileges reinstated, they would need to provide updated financials showing their ability to meet their payment obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company made no curtailment in available commitments on Green Loans.
On the interest only loans, the Company projects future payment changes to determine if there will be an increase in payment of 3.50 percent or greater and then monitors the loans for possible delinquencies. The individual loans are monitored for possible downgrading of risk rating, and trends within the portfolio are identified that could affect other interest only loans scheduled for payment changes in the near future.
NTM loans may entail greater risk than do traditional SFR mortgage loans. For additional information regarding NTMs, see "Non-Traditional Mortgage Loans" under Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Traditional loans and leases that were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days totaled $18.6 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 11.9 percent, from $21.1 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in commercial and industrial and SBA loans, partially offset by increases in construction, commercial real estate, multifamily, SFR mortgage and other consumer loans.
The decrease in SFR mortgage loan delinquencies during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was mainly due to sales of SFR mortgage loan pools during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company did not have any outstanding seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools at December 31, 2018 or 2017.

The increase in non-accrual commercial and industrial loans in 2018 was mainly due to two loans, which were individually evaluated for impairment, with a carrying value of $1.9 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in single family residential mortgage loans in 2018 was mainly due to two loans, which were individually evaluated for impairment, with a carrying value of $5.3 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease in non-accrual other consumer loans in 2018 was mainly due to the sale of the $4.4 million loan during the year ended December 31, 2018 which was classified as non-accrual as of December 31, 2017. The increase in non-accrual other consumer loans in 2017 was mainly due to one loan, which was individually evaluated for impairment, with a carrying value of $4.4 million at December 31, 2017.
With respect to loans that were on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2018, the gross interest income that would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 had such loans and leases been current in accordance with their original terms and been outstanding throughout the year ended December 31, 2018 (or since origination, if held for part of the year ended December 31, 2018), was $1.3 million. The amount of interest income on such loans that was included in net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $280 thousand.

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
Loans that the Company modifies or restructures where the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and makes a concession to the borrower in the form of changes in the amortization terms, reductions in the interest rates, the acceptance of interest only payments and, in limited cases, reductions in the outstanding loan balances are classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). TDRs are loans modified for the purpose of alleviating temporary impairments to the borrower’s financial condition. A workout plan between a borrower and the Company is designed to provide a bridge for the cash flow shortfalls in the near term. If the borrower works through the near term issues, in most cases, the original contractual terms of the loan will be reinstated.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had 13 and 12 loans, respectively, with an aggregate balance of $8.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively, classified as TDRs. When a loan becomes a TDR the Company ceases accruing interest, and classifies it as non-accrual until the borrower demonstrates that the loan is again performing.
At December 31, 2018, of the 13 loans classified as TDRs, 12 loans totaling $5.7 million were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms and were in accruing status. At December 31, 2017, of the 12 loans classified as TDRs, 11 loans totaling $5.6 million were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms and were in accruing status.

Risk Ratings
Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and leases and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve or charge-off is not warranted.
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allocation allowances for loan and lease losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the Board of Directors. General allocation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allocation allowance for losses equal to 100 percent of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its specific allocation allowances is subject to review by the OCC, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allocation allowances.
In connection with the filing of the Bank’s periodic reports with the OCC and in accordance with policies for the Bank's classification of assets, the Bank regularly reviews the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of management’s review of assets, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had classified assets (including OREO) totaling $84.5 million and $54.8 million, respectively. The total amount classified represented 0.79 percent and 0.53 percent of the Company’s total assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The Company maintains an ALLL to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date. The ALLL is based on ongoing assessment of the estimated probable losses presently inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. In evaluating the level of the ALLL, management considers the types of loans and leases and the amount of loans and leases in the portfolio, peer group information, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. This methodology takes into account many factors, including the Company’s own historical and peer loss trends, loan and lease-level credit quality ratings, loan and lease specific attributes along with a review of various credit metrics and trends. The process involves subjective as well as complex judgments. In addition, the Company uses adjustments for numerous factors including those found in the federal banking agencies' joint Interagency Policy Statement on ALLL, which include current economic conditions, loan and lease seasoning, underwriting experience, and collateral value changes among others. The Company evaluates all impaired loans and leases individually using guidance from ASC 310 primarily through the evaluation of cash flows or collateral values. The Company’s loan segmentation increased from 11 to 13 segments, with the addition of an Indirect Leverage Lending segment and a Warehouse FixNFlip segment.  Management concluded these products represented unique credit and risk characteristics to warrant separate segmentation. Additionally, management enhanced the methodology in the areas of qualitative adjustments, and performed an annual update of the loss emergence period. These updates were designed to be systematic, transparent, and repeatable. None of the updates and enhancements made to the ALLL methodology had a material impact on the reserve at December 31, 2018.
At December 31, 2018, the Company's ALLL was $62.2 million or 0.81 percent of total loans and leases, as compared to $49.3 million, or 0.74 percent of total loans and leases at December 31, 2017. The Company recorded $30.2 million, $13.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to its provision for loan and lease losses. The increase in ALLL and provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was mainly due to a $12.5 million increase in net charge offs during the year, 15.6 percent incremental growth in the loan and lease portfolio from the prior year, an increase in classified loans of 97.8 percent and methodology enhancements implemented throughout the year ended December 31, 2018, such as extension of look-back period, enhancements of qualitative adjustments and loan segmentation, and annual update of the loss emergence period. ALLL for loans and leases collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2018 was $61.4 million, which represented 0.80 percent of the attributable loans and leases, as compared to $48.1 million, or 0.73 percent of attributable loans and leases at December 31, 2017. The ALLL for loans individually evaluated for impairment was $829 thousand at December 31, 2018 compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2017. The Company held no unallocated ALLL at December 31, 2018 and 2017.
During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a charge-off of $13.9 million, which reflected the outstanding balance under a $15.0 million line of credit that was originated during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Subsequent to the granting of the line of credit, representations from the borrower in applying for the line of credit were determined by the Bank to be false, and third party bank account statements provided by the borrower to secure the line of credit were found to be fraudulent. The line of credit was granted after the borrower appeared to have satisfied a pre-condition that the line of credit be fully cash collateralized and secured by a bank account at a third party financial institution pledged to the Bank. As part of the Bank’s credit review and portfolio management process, the line of credit and disbursements were reviewed subsequent to closing and compliance with the borrower’s covenants was monitored. As part of this process, on March 9, 2018, the Bank received information that caused it to believe the existence of the pledged bank account had been misrepresented by the borrower and that the account had previously been closed. The Bank filed an action in federal court pursuing the borrower and other parties and is also considering other available sources of collection and other potential means of mitigating the loss; however, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in this regard. Upon extensive review of the underwriting process for this loan, the Bank determined that this loan was the result of an isolated event of external fraud.
The increase in ALLL and provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was mainly driven by a $4.5 million increase in net charge offs during the year, as well as 10 percent incremental growth in the loan and lease portfolio from the prior year.

Alternative Energy Partnerships
The following table presents the activity related to the Company’s investment in alternative energy partnerships for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ ---- ------- - ------

 Year Ended December 31,
($ in thousands) 2018 2017
Balance at beginning of period $ 48,826 $ 25,639
New funding — 55,377

Loss on investments using HLBV method (5,044 ) (30,786 )
Balance at end of period $ 28,988 $ 48,826
Unfunded equity commitments $ — $ 50,084

The Company’s investments in alternative energy partnerships are primarily returned through the realization of energy tax credits and other tax benefits rather than through distributions or through the sale of the investment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized energy tax credits of $9.6 million, offset by $1.0 million of tax expenses from tax basis reduction in connection with new equipment being placed into service as well as income tax benefits of $1.4 million (based on a current effective tax rate of 27.4 percent, which excludes the foregoing energy tax credits and related deferred tax expense) related to the recognition of its loss through its HLBV application. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized energy tax credits of $38.2 million, offset by $6.7 million of tax expense from tax basis reduction as well as income tax benefits of $12.1 million (based on a current effective tax rate of 39.5 percent, which excludes the foregoing energy tax credits and related deferred tax expense) related to the recognition of its loss through its HLBV application. The HLBV loss for the period is largely driven by accelerated tax depreciation on equipment and the recognition of energy tax credits which reduces the amount distributable by the investee in a hypothetical liquidation under the contractual liquidation provisions.

Deposits
Total deposits were $7.92 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $623.7 million, or 8.6 percent, from $7.29 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly due to the Company's continuous efforts to build core deposits across the Company's business units, including strong growth from the community banking and private banking channel and increased brokered deposits. As a result, this is one of the factors that caused net interest margin to decline during the year ended December 31, 2018. Brokered deposits were $1.71 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $252.1 million, or 17.3 percent, from $1.46 billion at December 31, 2017. Brokered deposits represented 21.6 percent and 20.0 percent of total deposits at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Borrowings
Although deposits are the Company's primary source of funds, the Company may utilize borrowings when they are a less costly source of funds and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, when the Company desires additional capacity to fund loan and lease demand or when they meet the Company's asset/liability management goals to diversify funding sources and enhance the interest rate risk management.
The Company utilizes FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements to leverage its capital base, to provide funds for its lending activities, to provide a source of liquidity, and to enhance its interest rate risk management. The Company also has the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Federal Reserve Bank), as well as through unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks. The Company may obtain advances from the FHLB by collateralizing the advances with certain of the Company’s loans and investment securities. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features.
FHLB advances totaled $1.52 billion and $1.70 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. At December 31, 2018, $805.0 million of the Bank's advances from FHLB were fixed rate and had interest rates ranging from 1.61 percent to 3.32 percent with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.58 percent, and $715.0 million of the Bank's advances from FHLB were variable rate and had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.56 percent. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank’s advances from the FHLB were collateralized by certain real estate loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $4.05 billion and $2.90 billion, respectively, and securities with carrying values of $0 and $405.6 million, respectively. The Bank’s investment in capital stock of the FHLB of San Francisco totaled $41.0 million and $48.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Based on this collateral and the Bank’s holdings of FHLB stock, the Bank was eligible to borrow an additional $1.35 billion at December 31, 2018.
The Company did not have any outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2018 or 2017. On June 30, 2017, the Company voluntarily terminated a line of credit of $75.0 million that it maintained at Banc of California,

Inc. with an unaffiliated financial institution. The line had a maturity date of July 17, 2017. The Company had $50.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the line, which were repaid in connection with the termination of the line.
The Company entered into a new line of credit for $15.0 million on February 14, 2019, which bears interest at LIBOR plus 2% and is scheduled to mature on February 13, 2020.

Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments
The Company maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that is considered adequate to cover the estimated and known inherent risks. The probability of usage of the unfunded loan commitments and credit risk factors are determined based on outstanding loans that share similar credit risk exposure. Reserve for unfunded loan commitments totaled $4.6 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $906 thousand, or 24.4 percent, from $3.7 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher balances in unfunded loan commitments.
The following table presents a summary of activity in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments for the periods indicated:

--------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- --- - -----

 Year Ended December 31,
($ in thousands) 2018 2017 2016
Balance at beginning of period $ 3,716 $ 2,385 $ 2,067
Provision for unfunded loan commitments 906 1,331 318
Balance at end of period $ 4,622 $ 3,716 $ 2,385

Reserve for Loss on Repurchased Loans
When the Company sells residential mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market, the Company makes customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about various characteristics of each loan, such as the manner of origination, the nature and extent of underwriting standards applied and the types of documentation being provided. Typically, these representations and warranties are in place for the life of the loan. If a defect in the origination process is identified, the Company may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. If there are no such defects, generally the Company has no liability to the purchaser for losses it may incur on such loan. In addition, the Company had the option to buy out severely delinquent loans at par from Ginnie Mae pools for which the Company was the servicer and issuer of the pool. The Company maintains a reserve for losses on repurchased loans to account for the expected losses related to loans the Company might be required to repurchase (or the indemnity payments the Company may have to make to purchasers). The reserve takes into account both the estimate of expected losses on loans sold during the current accounting period, as well as adjustments to the previous estimates of expected losses on loans sold. In each case, these estimates are based on the most recent data available, including data from third parties, regarding demand for loan repurchases, actual loan repurchases, and actual credit losses on repurchased loans, among other factors.
Reserve for loss on repurchased loans totaled $2.5 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 60.3 percent, from $6.3 million at December 31, 2017. Approximately $1.5 million of the decrease was due to portfolio run-off and repurchase settlement activities.
Provisions added to the reserve for loss on repurchased loans are initially recorded against income from discontinued operations at the time of sale, and any subsequent increase or decrease in the provision is then recorded under noninterest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an increase or decrease to provision for loan repurchases. Initial provisions for loan repurchases were $126 thousand, $1.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively, and subsequent changes in the prevision were $(2.5) million, $(1.8) million and $(3.4) million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Liquidity Management
The Company is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Historically, the Company has maintained liquid assets above levels believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows, and dividend payments. Cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.
Banc of California, N.A.
The Bank's liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale, is a product of its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Bank's primary sources of funds are deposits, payments and maturities of outstanding loans and investment securities; sale of loans and investment securities and other short-term investments and funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and investment securities, and maturing investment securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. In addition, the Bank invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. The Bank also generates cash through borrowings. The Bank mainly utilizes FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements to leverage its capital base, to provide funds for its lending activities, as a source of liquidity, and to enhance its interest rate risk management. The Bank also has the ability to obtain brokered deposits and collect deposits through its wholesale and treasury operations. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Any excess liquidity is typically invested in federal funds or investment securities. On a longer-term basis, the Bank maintains a strategy of investing in various lending products. The Bank uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing loan and other commitments, and to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals.
Banc of California, Inc.
The primary sources of funds for Banc of California, Inc., on a stand-alone holding company basis, are dividends and intercompany tax payments from the Bank, outside borrowing, and its ability to raise capital and issue debt securities. Dividends from the Bank are largely dependent upon the Bank's earnings and are subject to restrictions under certain regulations that limit its ability to transfer funds to the holding company. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on the ability of a bank to make capital distributions, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, and certain other items. Generally, a well-capitalized bank may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to up to 100 percent of year-to-date net income plus retained net income for the two preceding years without prior OCC approval. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $104.3 million available to pay dividends to Banc of California, Inc. without prior OCC approval. However, any dividend granted by the Bank would be limited by the need to maintain its well capitalized status plus the capital buffer in order to avoid additional dividend restrictions. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank paid dividends of $94.3 million to Banc of California, Inc. At December 31, 2018, Banc of California, Inc. had $25.3 million in cash, all of which was on deposit at the Bank.
On a consolidated basis, the Company maintained $391.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was 3.7 percent of total assets at December 31, 2018. The Company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $3.9 million, or 1.0 percent, from $387.7 million, or 3.8 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2017. The increase was mainly due to increases in deposits and a decrease in securities, partially offset by an increase in loans, a decrease in FHLB advances and redemption of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock. The Company also strategically decreased its securities portfolio to navigate a volatile rate environment by reducing overall duration by selling longer-duration and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt securities and continued allowing collateralized loan obligations to run off. All of these strategic actions were taken in order to expand core lending activities across the organization, while reducing risk on the Company's balance sheet.
At December 31, 2018, the Company had available unused secured borrowing capacities of $1.35 billion from FHLB and $60.6 million from Federal Reserve Discount Window, as well as $210.0 million from unused unsecured federal funds lines of credit. The Company also maintained repurchase agreements and had no outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements at December 31, 2018. Availabilities and terms on repurchase agreements are subject to the counterparties' discretion and pledging additional investment securities. The Company had unpledged securities available-for-sale of $1.83 billion at December 31, 2018. On June 30, 2017, the Company voluntarily terminated a line of credit of $75.0 million that was maintained at Banc of California, Inc. with an unaffiliated financial institution. The line originally had a maturity date of July 17, 2017. The Company had $50.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the line, which were repaid in connection with the termination of the line.
The Company believes that its liquidity sources are stable and are adequate to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements. As of December 31, 2018, the Company believes that there are no events, uncertainties, material commitments, or capital expenditures that were reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity position.

During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Bank entered into certain definitive agreements which grant the Bank the exclusive naming rights to the Banc of California Stadium, a soccer stadium of The Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) as well as the right to be the official bank of LAFC. In exchange for the Bank’s rights as set forth in the agreements, the Bank agreed to pay LAFC $100.0 million over a period of 15 years, beginning in 2017 and ending in 2032. The advertising benefits of such rights are amortized on a straight-line basis and recorded as advertising and promotion expense beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank has paid $15.3 million of the $100.0 million commitment. The prepaid commitment balance, net of amortization, was $8.7 million as of December 31, 2018, which was recognized as a prepaid asset and included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. See Note 26 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
The Company had unfunded commitments of $11.5 million, $8.8 million, and $501 thousand for Affordable Housing Fund Investment, SBIC, and Other Investments at December 31, 2018, respectively.

Stockholders’ Equity
Stockholders’ equity totaled $945.5 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $66.8 million, or 6.6 percent, from $1.01 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of the redemption of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock for an aggregate amount of $40.3 million, cash dividends for common stock of $26.0 million, cash dividends for preferred stock of $19.5 million and $29.8 million of other comprehensive loss on securities available-for-sale due primarily to increases in market interest rates, partially offset by net income of $45.5 during the year ended December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In order to maintain adequate levels of capital, the Company continuously assesses projected sources and uses of capital to support projected asset growth, operating needs and credit risk. The Company considers, among other things, earnings generated from operations and access to capital from financial markets. In addition, the Company performs capital stress tests on an annual basis to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy on the Company's capital base.
Regulatory Capital
The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines that are established by the Federal banking regulators. In July 2013, the Federal banking regulators approved a final rule to implement the revised capital adequacy standards of the Basel III and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule strengthens the definition of regulatory capital, increases risk-based capital requirements, makes selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets, and adjusts the prompt corrective action thresholds. The Company and the Bank became subject to the new rule on January 1, 2015 and certain provisions of the new rule were phased in through January 1, 2019. Inclusive of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer, the common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratio minimums are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. For additional information on BASEL III capital rules, see Note 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table presents the regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of dates indicated:

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations adopted by the federal banking regulators, bank holding companies and banks with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion were required to conduct an annual “stress test” of capital and consolidated earnings and losses under the baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the federal banking regulators.  On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”) was signed into law, which amended portions of the Dodd-Frank Act and immediately raised the asset threshold for company-run stress testing from $10 billion to $100 billion for bank holding companies.  As a result, the Company is no longer subject to the Dodd-Frank Act company-run stress testing requirements.  On July 6, 2018, the federal banking regulators issued an interagency statement that banks with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Bank, would not be required to comply with company-run stress testing requirements until November 25, 2019, at which time such banks will become exempt from company-run stress testing requirements under the Economic Growth Act.  In addition, the federal banking regulators have each proposed to amend their stress testing regulations consistent with the Economic Growth Act. The federal banking regulators noted in their July 6, 2018 interagency statement that the capital planning and risk management practices of banks with assets less than $100 billion will continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performan...

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses
Provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to operations at a level required to reflect incurred credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Company recorded $30.2 million, $13.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 to its provision for loan and lease losses.
The increase in provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was mainly due to a $12.5 million increase in net charge offs during the year, 15.6 percent incremental growth in the loan and lease portfolio from the prior year, an increase in classified loans of 97.8 percent and methodology enhancements implemented throughout the year ended December 31, 2018, such as extension of look-back period, enhancements of qualitative adjustments and loan segmentation, and annual update of the loss emergence period. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a charge-off of $13.9 million, which reflected the outstanding balance under a $15.0 million line of credit that was originated during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Subsequent to the granting of the line of credit, representations from the borrower in applying for the line of credit were determined by the Bank to be false, and third party bank account statements provided by the borrower to secure the line of credit were found to be fraudulent. The line of credit was granted after the borrower appeared to have satisfied a pre-condition that the line of credit be fully cash collateralized and secured by a bank account at a third party financial institution pledged to the Bank. As part of the Bank’s

credit review and portfolio management process, the line of credit and disbursements were reviewed subsequent to closing and compliance with the borrower’s covenants was monitored. As part of this process, on March 9, 2018, the Bank received information that caused it to believe the existence of the pledged bank account had been misrepresented by the borrower and that the account had previously been closed. The Bank filed an action in federal court pursuing the borrower and other parties and is also considering other available sources of collection and other potential means of mitigating the loss; however, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in this regard. Upon extensive review of the underwriting process for this loan, the Bank determined that this loan was the result of an isolated event of external fraud.
The increase in provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was mainly driven by a $4.5 million increase in net charge offs during the year, as well as 10 percent incremental growth in the loan and lease portfolio from the prior year.

Income Tax Expense
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, income tax expense (benefit) of continuing operations was $4.8 million, $(26.6) million and $13.7 million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was 10.3 percent, (98.8) percent and 13.7 percent, respectively.
The Company’s effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 mainly due to the reduction in the recognition of tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships, which were $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The reduction in tax credits received by the Bank on the investments in alternative energy partnerships is due to less new equipment being placed into service by the investments. The Company uses the flow-through income statement method to account for the tax credits earned on investments in alternative energy partnership. Under this method, the tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense and the initial book-tax difference in the basis of the investments are recognized as additional tax expense in the year they are earned. Also, in 2017 the Company recognized a $2.1 million net tax benefit as a result of re-measurement of the Company']:

Traditional loans and leases that were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days totaled $18.6 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.5 million, or 11.9 percent, from $21.1 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in commercial and industrial and SBA loans, partially offset by increases in construction, commercial real estate, multifamily, SFR mortgage and other consumer loans.
The decrease in SFR mortgage loan delinquencies during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was mainly due to sales of SFR mortgage loan pools during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company did not have any outstanding seasoned SFR mortgage loan pools at December 31, 2018 or 2017.

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
Loans that the Company modifies or restructures where the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and makes a concession to the borrower in the form of changes in the amortization terms, reductions in the interest rates, the acceptance of interest only payments and, in limited cases, reductions in the outstanding loan balances are classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). TDRs are loans modified for the purpose of alleviating temporary impairments to the borrower’s financial condition. A workout plan between a borrower and the Company is designed to provide a bridge for the cash flow shortfalls in the near term. If the borrower works through the near term issues, in most cases, the original contractual terms of the loan will be reinstated.
At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had 13 and 12 loans, respectively, with an aggregate balance of $8.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively, classified as TDRs. When a loan becomes a TDR the Company ceases accruing interest, and classifies it as non-accrual until the borrower demonstrates that the loan is again performing.
At December 31, 2018, of the 13 loans classified as TDRs, 12 loans totaling $5.7 million were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms and were in accruing status. At December 31, 2017, of the 12 loans classified as TDRs, 11 loans totaling $5.6 million were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms and were in accruing status.

Risk Ratings
Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and leases and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve or charge-off is not warranted.
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allocation allowances for loan and lease losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the Board of Directors. General allocation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allocation allowance for losses equal to 100 percent of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its specific allocation allowances is subject to review by the OCC, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allocation allowances.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...

['s realignment of segment reporting at December 31, 2014. The carrying values of goodwill allocated to the reportable segments were $37.1 million and $2.1 million to the Commercial Banking segment and Mortgage Banking segment, respectively, at December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company discontinued its mortgage banking operations and wrote off goodwill of $2.1 million, which was previously allocated to its Mortgage Banking segment, against the gain on disposal of discontinued operations.
The Company conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment as of August 31 each year, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2018 and determined that no goodwill impairment existed.
The Company had core deposit intangibles of $6.3 million and $9.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Core deposit intangibles are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 4 to 10 years. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted-average remaining amortization period for core deposit intangibles was approximately 5.3 years.
The Company recorded impairment on intangible assets of $0, $336 thousand, and $690 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company also wrote off a customer relationship intangible of $246 thousand and a trade name intangible of $90 thousand related to RenovationReady. RenovationReady was acquired in 2014 and provided specialized loan services to financial institutions and mortgage bankers that originate agency eligible residential renovation and construction loan products. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company ceased using the CS Financial trade name and wrote off the related trade name intangible of $690 thousand. CS Financial is a mortgage banking firm, which the Bank acquired in 2013.

Unfunded equity commitments $ — $ 50,084

The Company’s investments in alternative energy partnerships are primarily returned through the realization of energy tax credits and other tax benefits rather than through distributions or through the sale of the investment. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized energy tax credits of $9.6 million, offset by $1.0 million of tax expenses from tax basis reduction in connection with new equipment being placed into service as well as income tax benefits of $1.4 million (based on a current effective tax rate of 27.4 percent, which excludes the foregoing energy tax credits and related deferred tax expense) related to the recognition of its loss through its HLBV application. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized energy tax credits of $38.2 million, offset by $6.7 million of tax expense from tax basis reduction as well as income tax benefits of $12.1 million (based on a current effective tax rate of 39.5 percent, which excludes the foregoing energy tax credits and related deferred tax expense) related to the recognition of its loss through its HLBV application. The HLBV loss for the period is largely driven by accelerated tax depreciation on equipment and the recognition of energy tax credits which reduces the amount distributable by the investee in a hypothetical liquidation under the contractual liquidation provisions.

Stockholders’ Equity
Stockholders’ equity totaled $945.5 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $66.8 million, or 6.6 percent, from $1.01 billion at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily the result of the redemption of the Company']:
(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent.

Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments
The Company maintains a reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that is considered adequate to cover the estimated and known inherent risks. The probability of usage of the unfunded loan commitments and credit risk factors are determined based on outstanding loans that share similar credit risk exposure. Reserve for unfunded loan commitments totaled $4.6 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $906 thousand, or 24.4 percent, from $3.7 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by higher balances in unfunded loan commitments.
The following table presents a summary of activity in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments for the periods indicated:

Reserve for Loss on Repurchased Loans
When the Company sells residential mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market, the Company makes customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about various characteristics of each loan, such as the manner of origination, the nature and extent of underwriting standards applied and the types of documentation being provided. Typically, these representations and warranties are in place for the life of the loan. If a defect in the origination process is identified, the Company may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. If there are no such defects, generally the Company has no liability to the purchaser for losses it may incur on such loan. In addition, the Company had the option to buy out severely delinquent loans at par from Ginnie Mae pools for which the Company was the servicer and issuer of the pool. The Company maintains a reserve for losses on repurchased loans to account for the expected losses related to loans the Company might be required to repurchase (or the indemnity payments the Company may have to make to purchasers). The reserve takes into account both the estimate of expected losses on loans sold during the current accounting period, as well as adjustments to the previous estimates of expected losses on loans sold. In each case, these estimates are based on the most recent data available, including data from third parties, regarding demand for loan repurchases, actual loan repurchases, and actual credit losses on repurchased loans, among other factors.
Reserve for loss on repurchased loans totaled $2.5 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 60.3 percent, from $6.3 million at December 31, 2017. Approximately $1.5 million of the decrease was due to portfolio run-off and repurchase settlement activities.
Provisions added to the reserve for loss on repurchased loans are initially recorded against income from discontinued operations at the time of sale, and any subsequent increase or decrease in the provision is then recorded under noninterest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as an increase or decrease to provision for loan repurchases. Initial provisions for loan repurchases were $126 thousand, $1.6 million and $3.9 million, respectively, and subsequent changes in the prevision were $(2.5) million, $(1.8) million and $(3.4) million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Liquidity Management
The Company is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Historically, the Company has maintained liquid assets above levels believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows, and dividend payments. Cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.
