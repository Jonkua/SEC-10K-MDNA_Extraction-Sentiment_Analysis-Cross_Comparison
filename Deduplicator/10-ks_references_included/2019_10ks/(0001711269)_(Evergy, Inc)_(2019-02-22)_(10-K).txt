ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EVERGY, INC.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Evergy, Inc. is a public utility holding company incorporated in 2017 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Westar Energy is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas. Westar Energy has one active wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, KGE.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• KCP&L is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• GMO is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• GPETHC owns 13.5% of Transource with the remaining 86.5% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of AEP. Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects. GPETHC accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method.

Westar Energy also owns a 50% interest in Prairie Wind, which is a joint venture between Westar Energy and affiliates of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company. Prairie Wind owns a 108-mile, 345 kV double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the SPP. Westar Energy accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method.
Westar Energy and KGE conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Westar Energy. KCP&L and GMO conduct business in their respective service territories using the name KCP&L. Collectively, the Evergy Companies have approximately 14,500 MWs of owned generating capacity and renewable purchased power agreements and engage in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 1.6 million customers in the states of Kansas and Missouri. The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment).
Great Plains Energy and Westar Energy Merger
Evergy was incorporated in 2017 as Monarch Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. Prior to the closing of the merger transactions, Monarch Energy changed its name to Evergy and did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Amended Merger Agreement. On June 4, 2018, in accordance with the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy merged into Evergy, with Evergy surviving the merger and King Energy merged into Westar Energy, with Westar Energy surviving the merger. These merger transactions resulted in Evergy becoming the parent entity of Westar Energy and the direct subsidiaries of Great Plains Energy, including KCP&L and GMO. As a result of the closing of the merger transactions, each outstanding share of Great Plains Energy common stock was converted into 0.5981 shares of Evergy common stock, resulting in the issuance of 128.9 million shares. Additionally, each outstanding share of Westar Energy common stock was converted into 1 share of Evergy common stock.
Westar Energy was determined to be the accounting acquirer and thus, the predecessor of Evergy. Therefore, Evergy's accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations of Westar Energy for 2017 and 2016 and the financial position of Westar Energy as of December 31, 2017. Evergy had separate operations for the period beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and references to amounts for periods after the closing of the merger relate to Evergy. The results of Great Plains Energy's direct subsidiaries have been included in Evergy's results of operations from the date of the closing of the merger and thereafter.
KCP&L has elected not to apply "push-down accounting" related to the merger, whereby the adjustments of assets and liabilities to fair value and the resulting goodwill would be recorded on the financial statements of the acquired subsidiary. These adjustments for KCP&L, as well as those related to the acquired assets and liabilities of Great Plains Energy and its other direct subsidiaries, are only reflected on Evergy's consolidated financial statements.
See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the merger.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
In July 2018, the Evergy Board authorized the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of Evergy's common stock. Although this repurchase authorization has no expiration date, Evergy expects to repurchase approximately 60 million shares by mid-2020. Evergy plans to utilize various methods to effectuate the share repurchase program, including but not limited to, a series of transactions that may include ASRs, open market transactions or other means, subject to market conditions and applicable legal requirements. The repurchase program may be suspended, discontinued or resumed at any time. For 2018, Evergy had total repurchases of common stock of approximately $1,042 million and had repurchased 16.4 million shares under the repurchase program. These repurchase totals include shares repurchased under ASR agreements, one of which had not reached final settlement as of December 31, 2018, and are discussed further below.
In August 2018, Evergy entered into two ASR agreements with financial institutions to purchase $450.0 million of Evergy common stock. The ASR agreements reached final settlement in the fourth quarter of 2018 and resulted in the delivery of 7.9 million shares to Evergy based on the average daily volume weighted-average price of Evergy common stock during the term of the ASR agreements, less a negotiated discount.

30

Table of Contents

In November 2018, Evergy entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to purchase $475.0 million of Evergy common stock. In December 2018, the financial institution delivered to Evergy 6.4 million shares of common stock, representing a partial settlement of the contract, based on then-current market prices and Evergy paid a total of $475.0 million. The final number of shares of Evergy common stock that Evergy may receive or be required to remit upon settlement of the ASR agreement will be based on the average daily volume weighted-average price of Evergy common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, less a negotiated discount. Final settlement of the ASR agreement will occur by March 2019, but may occur earlier at the option of the financial institution. Evergy expects that the final settlement of the ASR agreement will result in the delivery of additional shares of common stock to Evergy at no additional cost.
See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Evergy's common stock repurchase program.
Missouri Legislation
On June 1, 2018, Missouri Senate Bill (S.B.) 564 was signed into law by the Governor of Missouri. Most notably, S.B. 564 includes a PISA provision that can be elected by Missouri electric utilities to defer to a regulatory asset and recover 85% of depreciation expense and associated return on investment for qualifying electric plant rate base additions. Qualifying electric plant includes all rate base additions with the exception of new coal, nuclear or natural gas generating units or rate base additions that increase revenues by allowing service to new customer premises. The deferred depreciation and return recorded in the associated regulatory asset, except for any prudence disallowances, is required to be included in determining the utility's rate base during subsequent general rate proceedings subject to a 3% compound annual growth rate limitation on future electric rates compared with the utility's rates in effect prior to electing PISA. Utilities that elect the PISA provision can make qualifying deferrals of depreciation and return through December 2023, with a potential extension through December 2028 subject to MPSC approval. Except under certain circumstances, utilities that elect the PISA provision must keep base rates constant for three years following the utilities' last general rate case. KCP&L and GMO have elected the PISA provision of S.B. 564 effective as of January 1, 2019.
Regulatory Proceedings
See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding regulatory proceedings.
Plant Retirements
In 2017, Westar Energy announced plans to retire Unit 7 at Tecumseh Energy Center, Units 3 and 4 at Murray Gill Energy Center and Units 1 and 2 at Gordon Evans Energy Center, subject to the completion of the merger in 2018. In 2017, KCP&L and GMO also announced plans to retire KCP&L's Montrose Station and GMO's Sibley Station.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, Westar Energy, KCP&L and GMO retired these stations consistent with their previously announced plans.
Strategy
Evergy expects to continue operating its vertically integrated utilities within the currently existing regulatory frameworks. Evergy's objectives are to deliver value to shareholders through earnings and dividend growth; serve customers and communities with reliable service, clean energy and fewer and lower rate increases; and maintain a rewarding and challenging work environment for employees. Significant elements of Evergy's strategy to achieve these objectives include:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the realization of a total of approximately $550 million of potential net savings from 2018 through 2022 resulting from synergies that are expected to be created as a result of the merger;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the repurchase of approximately 60 million outstanding shares of Evergy common stock by mid-2020;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• anticipated rate base investment of approximately $6 billion from 2018 through 2022;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the continued growth of Evergy's renewable energy portfolio as the Evergy Companies retire older and less efficient fossil fuel plants; and

Earnings Overview
The following table summarizes Evergy's net income and diluted earnings per common share (EPS).

--------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ ----- ---- ---- ------ ----- ---- - -----

 2018 2017 Change
 (millions, except per share amounts)
Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. $ 535.8 $ 323.9 $ 211.9
Earnings per common share, diluted 2.50 2.27 0.23

Net income and diluted EPS increased in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the inclusion of KCP&L's and GMO's earnings beginning in June 2018, higher Westar Energy retail sales driven by favorable weather and lower income tax expense, partially offset by merger-related costs and reductions of revenue for customer bill credits incurred following the close of the merger.
In addition, a higher number of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding due to the issuance of common shares to Great Plains Energy shareholders as a result of the merger diluted earnings per share $1.26 for 2018.
For additional information regarding the change in net income, refer to the Evergy Results of Operations section within this MD&A.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding related party transactions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on Evergy's results of operations and financial position. Management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of Evergy's results of operations and financial position. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Evergy Board.

Pensions
Evergy incurs significant costs in providing non-contributory defined pension benefits. The costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience.
Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, life expectancies, compensation levels and employment periods), earnings on plan assets, the level of contributions made to the plan, and plan amendments. In addition, pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.
The assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted-average of long-term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan. The assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation. These assumptions, updated annually at the measurement date, are based on management's best estimates and judgment; however, material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs.
The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 0.5% increase or a 0.5% decrease in key actuarial assumptions for Evergy's qualified pension plans. Each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only.

----------------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- ----- ------ - ---- - ----- -

 Impact on Impact on
 Projected 2019
 Change in Benefit Pension
Actuarial assumption Assumption Obligation Expense
 (millions)
Discount rate 0.5 % increase $ (173.9 ) $ (19.0 )
Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 % increase — (8.1 )
Rate of compensation 0.5 % increase 40.5 8.5
Discount rate 0.5 % decrease 197.3 21.3
Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 % decrease — 8.1
Rate of compensation 0.5 % decrease (36.4 ) (7.7 )

Pension expense for Westar Energy, KCP&L and GMO is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC. The orders allow the difference between pension costs under GAAP and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds, as appropriate.
In 2018, Evergy's pension expense was $90.1 million under GAAP and $98.4 million for ratemaking. The impact on 2019 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on GAAP pension costs. Under the Evergy Companies' rate agreements, any increase or decrease in GAAP pension expense would be deferred in a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking treatment. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions.
Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan. It is difficult to predict future pension costs, changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions.
Revenue Recognition
Evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount it has the right to invoice. Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by Evergy. Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the

33

Table of Contents

month. This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs. Evergy's estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates. Evergy's unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes. See Note 4 for the balance of unbilled receivables for Evergy as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
Evergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues. Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.
Management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to Evergy; and changes in laws and regulations. If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations. Evergy's continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules. In the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of Evergy's operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided. Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Impairments of Assets and Goodwill
Long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under GAAP.
Accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value. Evergy's consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis. Evergy's first impairment test for the $2,338.9 million of goodwill from the Great Plains Energy and Westar Energy merger will be conducted on May 1, 2019.
Evergy anticipates that the determination of fair value for the reporting unit will consist of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using market multiples derived from the historical revenue, earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, net utility asset values and market prices of stock of peer companies. The results of the two techniques will be evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considers representative of fair value for the reporting unit, which involves a significant amount of management judgment.
The discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions: estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows. Management will determine the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the KCC and MPSC and after-tax cost of debt. Estimated future cash flows are based on Evergy's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of return on equity, anticipated earnings/returns related to future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts. Management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. Should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions

34

Table of Contents

differ significantly from the current assumptions, revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of the Evergy reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill.
The market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by management's selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit, as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock. Management will determine an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry. Changes in results of peer companies, selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of the Evergy reporting unit.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards. Evergy is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in Evergy's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities. This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ. Evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Evergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. Concurrent with the recognition of the liability, the estimated cost of the ARO incurred at the time the related long-lived assets were either acquired, placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective. The recording of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability.
Evergy initially recorded AROs at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission Wolf Creek (94% share), retire wind generating facilities, dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants, remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills, among other items. ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. In determining Evergy's AROs, assumptions are made regarding probable future disposal costs and the timing of their occurrence. A change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on Evergy's AROs reflected on its consolidated balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Evergy had recorded AROs of $687.1 million and $405.1 million, respectively. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Evergy's AROs.

EVERGY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Evergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors including rate regulation, fuel costs, weather, customer behavior and demand, the economy and competitive forces.
Substantially all of Evergy's revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a significant impact on the price the Evergy Companies charge for electric service. Evergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by its ability to align overall spending, both operating and capital, within the frameworks established by its regulators.

35

Table of Contents

Wholesale revenues are impacted by, among other factors, demand, cost and availability of fuel and purchased power, price volatility, available generation capacity, transmission availability and weather.
The Evergy Companies primarily use coal and uranium for the generation of electricity for their customers and also purchase power on the open market. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including supply, demand, weather and the broader economic environment. Westar Energy, KCP&L and GMO have fuel recovery mechanisms in their Kansas and Missouri jurisdictions, as applicable, that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund, through customer rates, substantially all of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding.
Weather significantly affects the amount of electricity that Evergy's customers use as electricity sales are seasonal. As summer peaking utilities, the third quarter typically accounts for the greatest electricity sales by the Evergy Companies. Hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand, especially among residential and commercial customers, and to a lesser extent, industrial customers. Mild weather reduces customer demand.
Energy efficiency investments by customers and the Evergy Companies also can affect the demand for electric service. Through the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA), KCP&L and GMO offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their Missouri retail customers and recover program costs, throughput disincentive, and as applicable, certain performance incentives in retail rates through a rider mechanism.
The following table summarizes Evergy's comparative results of operations.

Evergy Utility Gross Margin and MWh Sales
Utility gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Utility gross margin, as used by the Evergy Companies, is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs. Expenses for fuel and purchased power costs, offset by wholesale sales margin, are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms.  As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income. In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by SPP members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO.  As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the manner in which Evergy reflects SPP revenues and expenses.

36

Table of Contents

Management believes that utility gross margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the Evergy Companies' operations across periods compared with operating revenues because utility gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses.  Utility gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board.  The Evergy Companies' definition of utility gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies.
The following tables summarize Evergy's utility gross margin and MWhs sold.

Evergy's utility gross margin increased $1,155.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017 driven by:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an $1,181.5 million increase due to the inclusion of KCP&L's and GMO's utility gross margin beginning in June 2018; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $75.0 million increase primarily due to higher Westar Energy retail sales driven by warmer spring and summer weather and colder winter weather. For 2018 compared to 2017, cooling degree days increased 31% and heating degree days increased 23%; partially offset by

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $69.8 million provision for rate refund recorded at Westar Energy for the change in the corporate income tax rate caused by the passage of the TCJA. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $31.0 million reduction in revenue recorded at Westar Energy for one-time and annual bill credits as a result of conditions in the KCC merger order. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Evergy's utility gross margin decreased $38.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to lower Westar Energy retail sales driven by milder weather. For 2017 compared to 2016, cooling degree days decreased 13%.

See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Evergy relies primarily upon cash from operations, short-term borrowings, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its capital requirements. Evergy's capital requirements primarily consist of capital expenditures, payment of contractual obligations and other commitments, the payment of dividends to shareholders and the repurchase of common shares.
Capital Sources
Cash Flows from Operations
Evergy's cash flows from operations are driven by the regulated sale of electricity. These cash flows are relatively stable but the timing and level of these cash flows can vary based on weather and economic conditions, future regulatory proceedings, the timing of cash payments made for costs recoverable under regulatory mechanisms and the time such costs are recovered, and unanticipated expenses such as unplanned plant outages and/or storms.
Short-Term Borrowings
As of December 31, 2018, Evergy had $1.7 billion of available borrowing capacity from its master credit facility and receivable sale facilities. Westar Energy's, KCP&L's and GMO's borrowing capacity under the master credit facility also support their issuance of commercial paper. The available borrowing capacity consisted of $449.0 million from Evergy, Inc.'s master credit facility, $570.0 million from Westar Energy's credit facilities, $420.4 million from KCP&L's credit facilities and $297.9 million from GMO's credit facilities. See Notes 4 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the receivable sale facilities and master credit facility, respectively. Along with cash flows from operations, Evergy generally uses these liquid resources to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements.
Long-Term Debt and Equity Issuances
From time to time, Evergy issues long-term debt and/or equity to repay short-term debt, refinance maturing long-term debt and finance growth. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Evergy’s capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:

------------------------------ ----------- ----

 December 31
 2018 2017
Common equity 57% 51%
Noncontrolling interests
Long-term debt, including VIEs 43% 49%

After the completion of its common stock repurchase program, Evergy anticipates targeting a common equity to total capitalization ratio of approximately 47%-50%. Following the utilization of its excess cash and cash equivalents discussed further below, Evergy anticipates issuing debt in 2019 in support of its common stock

repurchase program. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capital Requirements - Common Stock Repurchase Program" for additional information.
Under stipulations with the MPSC and KCC, Evergy, Westar Energy and KCP&L are required to maintain common equity at not less than 35%, 40% and 40%, respectively, of total capitalization. The master credit facility and certain debt instruments of the Evergy Companies also contain restrictions that require the maintenance of certain capitalization and leverage ratios. As of December 31, 2018, the Evergy Companies were in compliance with these covenants.
Significant Debt Issuances
See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding significant debt issuances.
Credit Ratings
The ratings of the Evergy Companies' debt securities by the credit rating agencies impact their liquidity, including the cost of borrowings under their master credit facility and in the capital markets. The Evergy Companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as vital to their access to and cost of debt financing and, to that end, maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations, financial position and future prospects. While a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of the Evergy Companies' debt, it could increase interest charges under the master credit facility. A decrease in credit ratings could also have, among other things, an adverse impact, which could be material, on the Evergy Companies' access to capital, the cost of funds, the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings, the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and Evergy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries.

In addition to the above regulatory authorizations, the Westar Energy, KGE and KCP&L mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of FMBs that can be issued by each entity. Westar Energy, KGE and KCP&L must comply with these restrictions prior to the issuance of additional FMBs, general mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness.
Under the Westar Energy mortgage, the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, so long as any bonds issued prior to January 1, 1997, remain outstanding, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Westar Energy’s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest, depreciation and property retirement (which as defined, does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries), for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance, are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2018, $344.5 million principal amount of additional FMBs could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.
Under the KGE mortgage, the amount of FMBs authorized is limited to a maximum of $3.5 billion and the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless KGE’s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one-half times the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all KGE FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2018, KGE had sufficient capacity under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage to meet its near term financing and refinancing needs.

Under the KCP&L mortgage, additional KCP&L mortgage bonds may be issued on the basis of property additions or retired bonds. As of December 31, 2018, KCP&L had sufficient capacity under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage to meet its near term financing and refinancing needs.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
At December 31, 2018, Evergy had approximately $160.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Under the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy was required to have not less than $1.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet at the closing of the merger with Westar Energy. In 2018, Evergy primarily utilized this excess cash to repurchase approximately $1,042 million of common stock. Evergy anticipates that its remaining excess cash will also be returned to shareholders through the repurchase of common stock.

Operating lease commitments include leases for office buildings, computer equipment, operating facilities, vehicles and rail cars to serve jointly-owned generating units where Westar Energy or KCP&L is the managing partner and is reimbursed by other joint-owners for its proportionate share of the cost. Capital lease commitments include obligations for both principal and interest.
Evergy expects to contribute $118.3 million to the pension and other post-retirement plans in 2019, of which the majority is expected to be paid by Westar Energy and KCP&L. Additional contributions to the plans are expected beyond 2023 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined. Amounts for years after 2019 are estimates based on information available in determining the amount for 2019. Actual amounts for years after 2019 could be significantly different than the estimated amounts in the table above.
Fuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation costs. Power commitments consist of certain commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements. Other represents individual commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business.
Evergy has other insignificant long-term liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018, which do not have a definitive cash payout date and are not included in the table above.
Common Stock Dividends
The amount and timing of dividends payable on Evergy's common stock are within the sole discretion of the Evergy Board. The amount and timing of dividends declared by the Evergy Board will be dependent on considerations such as Evergy's earnings, financial position, cash flows, capitalization ratios, regulation, reinvestment opportunities and debt covenants. Evergy targets a long-term dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the common stock dividend declared by the Evergy Board in February 2019.
The Evergy Companies also have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements, corporate organizational documents, covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restrictions on dividend payments.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
In July 2018, the Evergy Board authorized the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of Evergy's common stock. Although this repurchase authorization has no expiration date, Evergy expects to repurchase approximately 60 million shares by mid-2020. For 2018, Evergy had total repurchases of common stock of approximately $1,042 million and had repurchased 16.4 million shares under the repurchase program. These repurchase totals include shares repurchased under ASR agreements, one of which had not reached final settlement as of December 31, 2018, and are discussed further below.

In August 2018, Evergy entered into two ASR agreements with financial institutions to purchase $450.0 million of Evergy common stock. The ASR agreements reached final settlement in the fourth quarter of 2018 and resulted in the delivery of 7.9 million shares to Evergy and Evergy paid a total of $450.0 million.

In November 2018, Evergy entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to purchase $475.0 million of Evergy common stock. In December 2018, the financial institution delivered to Evergy 6.4 million shares of common stock, representing a partial settlement of the contract, based on then-current market prices and Evergy paid a total of $475.0 million. The ASR agreement is expected to reach final settlement by March 2019 or earlier.

See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Evergy's common stock repurchase program.

Impact of TCJA
The TCJA will result in lower operating cash flows for the Evergy Companies due to lower income tax expense recoveries in customer rates and the settlement of related deferred income tax regulatory liabilities, which are significant. These decreases in operating cash flows are expected to exceed the increase in operating cash flows for the Evergy Companies resulting from the lower corporate federal income tax rate primarily due to the utilization of the Evergy Companies' net operating losses and tax credits. These net regulatory liabilities will be refunded in future rates by amortizing amounts related to plant assets primarily over the remaining useful life of the assets and amortizing the amounts related to the other items over various periods as determined in the Evergy Companies' 2018 rate cases.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, Evergy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes. In connection with the closing of the merger, Evergy assumed the guarantees previously provided to GMO by Great Plains Energy. The majority of these agreements guarantee Evergy's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded.
At December 31, 2018, Evergy has provided $111.3 million of credit support for GMO as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Evergy direct guarantees to GMO counterparties totaling $17.0 million, which expire in 2020, and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Evergy's guarantee of GMO long-term debt totaling $94.3 million, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2019 to 2023.

Evergy has also guaranteed GMO's short-term debt, including its commercial paper program. At December 31, 2018, GMO had $150.0 million of commercial paper outstanding. None of the guaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if GMO's credit ratings were downgraded.
The Evergy Companies also have off-balance sheet arrangements in the form of operating leases and letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business.
Cash Flows
The following table presents Evergy's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

---------------------------------------------- ------------- ------- ------ - ------ - - -----

 2018 2017 2016
 (in millions)
Cash flows from operating activities $ 1,497.8 $ 912.7 $ 803.8
Cash flows from (used in) investing activities 197.4 (780.8 ) (994.1 )
Cash flows from (used in) financing activities (1,538.4 ) (131.6 ) 190.2

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Evergy's $585.1 million increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by an $800.8 million increase due to the inclusion of KCP&L's and GMO's cash flows from operating activities beginning in June 2018; partially offset by an increase of $50.3 million in amounts paid by Westar Energy related to income taxes; $35.6 million of merger success fees paid by Evergy and Westar Energy upon the completion of the merger; an increase of $27.0 million in purchased power costs paid by Westar Energy; an increase of $15.3 million in Wolf Creek refueling outage costs paid by Westar Energy related to the outage that concluded in May 2018 and an $11.6 million increase in Westar Energy pension and post-retirement contributions.
The $108.9 million increase in cash flows from operating activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a $43.9 million increase in Westar Energy wholesale power sales and transmission services; a $26.3

Table of Contents

million decrease in amounts paid for Westar Energy coal and natural gas; a $26.0 million increase due to Westar Energy receiving a $13.0 million refund for income taxes in 2017 and Westar Energy paying $13.0 million in income taxes in 2016 and a $13.6 million increase from Westar Energy retail customers; partially offset by a $16.4 million increase in amounts paid for Westar Energy purchased power and transmission services and a $12.0 million increase in Westar Energy interest payments.
Cash Flows from (used in) Investing Activities
Evergy's cash flows from investing activities increased $978.2 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the inclusion of $1,154.2 million of cash acquired from Great Plains Energy as of the merger date.
Evergy's cash flows used in investing activities decreased $213.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by a $322.3 million decrease in additions to Westar Energy's property, plant and equipment primarily related to the construction of Western Plains Wind Farm in 2016; partially offset by receiving $110.5 million less proceeds from Westar Energy COLI investments than in 2016.
Cash Flows from (used in) Financing Activities
Evergy's cash flows used in financing activities increased $1,406.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of $1,042.3 million as a result of Evergy's share repurchase program in 2018; an increase in cash dividends paid of $251.9 million due to an increase in outstanding shares of common stock following the close of the merger and a $0.06 and $0.075 per share increase in the quarterly dividends paid in September 2018 and December 2018, respectively; an increase in retirements of long-term debt of $270.8 million; partially offset by an increase in collateralized short-term debt, net of $185.0 million due to Westar Energy's receivable sale facility that was entered into in December 2018.
Evergy's cash flows from financing activities decreased $321.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to Westar Energy issuing $207.5 million less in commercial paper; Westar Energy issuing $162.0 million less in long-term debt of VIEs; Westar Energy issuing $100.1 million less in long-term debt; Westar Energy's redemption of $75.0 million more in long-term debt and paying $18.8 million more in dividends; partially offset by Westar Energy redeeming $163.5 million less in long-term debt of VIEs and repaying $88.3 million less for borrowings against the cash surrender value of COLI.

EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins represent EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distor...

(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2  For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2019, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital.

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. CSX's investment of $943 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as investment in Conrail. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2019 $ 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 2023 27 Thereafter 20 Total $ 155 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $343 million as of December 2018. The following table discloses amounts related to Conrail. Purchase price amortization and equity earnings are included in equity earnings of affiliates and all other ...

CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. CSX's investment of $943 million is included on the consolidated balance sheet as investment in Conrail. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2019 $ 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 2023 27 Thereafter 20 Total $ 155 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $343 million as of December 2018.

Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2  For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency.

We are committed to pay a portion of the related actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. Certain of these arrangements have free rent periods or escalating rent payment provisions, and we recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis. The following is a schedule, by years, of the future minimum lease payments required under non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): ---------------------------- ---------------- ------ Operating Leases 2019 $ 698 2020 946 2021 1,055 2022 1,048 2023 1,054 Thereafter 9,850 Total minimum lease payments $ 14,651 Operating lease expense was $629 million, $363 million, and $269 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We fully repaid all our capital lease obligations during 2016. Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $6.17 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2018, primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Contingencies Lega...

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
Evergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues. Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.
Management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy']:

In addition to the above regulatory authorizations, the Westar Energy, KGE and KCP&L mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of FMBs that can be issued by each entity. Westar Energy, KGE and KCP&L must comply with these restrictions prior to the issuance of additional FMBs, general mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness.
Under the Westar Energy mortgage, the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, so long as any bonds issued prior to January 1, 1997, remain outstanding, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Westar Energy’s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest, depreciation and property retirement (which as defined, does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries), for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance, are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2018, $344.5 million principal amount of additional FMBs could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.
Under the KGE mortgage, the amount of FMBs authorized is limited to a maximum of $3.5 billion and the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless KGE’s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one-half times the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all KGE FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2018, KGE had sufficient capacity under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage to meet its near term financing and refinancing needs.

Under the KCP&L mortgage, additional KCP&L mortgage bonds may be issued on the basis of property additions or retired bonds. As of December 31, 2018, KCP&L had sufficient capacity under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage to meet its near term financing and refinancing needs.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
At December 31, 2018, Evergy had approximately $160.3 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Under the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy was required to have not less than $1.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet at the closing of the merger with Westar Energy. In 2018, Evergy primarily utilized this excess cash to repurchase approximately $1,042 million of common stock. Evergy anticipates that its remaining excess cash will also be returned to shareholders through the repurchase of common stock.

(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent.

['s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities. This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ. Evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Evergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. Concurrent with the recognition of the liability, the estimated cost of the ARO incurred at the time the related long-lived assets were either acquired, placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective. The recording of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability.
Evergy initially recorded AROs at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission Wolf Creek (94% share), retire wind generating facilities, dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants, remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills, among other items. ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity.
