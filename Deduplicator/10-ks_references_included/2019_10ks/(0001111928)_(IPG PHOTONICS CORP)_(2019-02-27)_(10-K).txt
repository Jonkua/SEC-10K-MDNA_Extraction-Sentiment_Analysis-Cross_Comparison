ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6, "Selected Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors."
Overview
We develop and manufacture a broad line of high-performance fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and diode lasers that are used in numerous applications, primarily in materials processing. We also manufacture certain complementary products used with our lasers, including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical processing heads and chillers. In addition, we offer laser-based systems for certain markets and applications. Following the acquisition of Genesis, we also offer non-laser-based customized robotic systems primarily for welding applications.
We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and end users. We market our products internationally primarily through our direct sales force. We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture most of our key components used in our finished products, from semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers and amplifiers.
Description of Our Net Sales, Costs and Expenses
Net sales. We derive net sales primarily from the sale of fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also sell diode lasers, communications systems, laser systems, customized robotic systems and complementary products. We sell our products through our direct sales organization and our network of distributors and sales representatives, as well as system integrators. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials processing laser systems, communications systems, medical laser systems and other laser systems for advanced applications to end users. We also sell our products to end users that build their own systems which incorporate our products or use our products as an energy or light source. Our scientists and engineers work closely with OEMs, systems integrators and end users to analyze their system requirements and match appropriate fiber laser, amplifier or system specifications to those requirements. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several months.
Sales of our products are, in general, recognized upon shipment, provided that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Our sales typically are made on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase commitments. Revenue from sales of customized robotic systems is recognized over time.
We develop our products to standard specifications and use a common set of components within our product architectures. Our major products are based upon a common technology platform. We continually enhance these and other products by improving their components and developing new components and new product designs.
The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as decreased manufacturing costs and increases in unit volumes, increased competition, the introduction of new products and market share considerations. In the past, we have lowered our selling prices in order to penetrate new markets and applications or to meet competition. Furthermore, we may negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that purchase multiple units or large volumes.
Cost of sales. Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead. We are vertically integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for our products as well as assemble finished products. We believe our vertical integration allows us to increase efficiencies, leverage our scale and lower our cost of sales. Cost of sales also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing, engineering and service operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, shipping costs and reserves for inventory obsolescence and for warranty obligations. Inventories are written off and charged to cost of sales when identified as excess or obsolete.
Due to our vertical integration strategy and ongoing investment in plant and machinery, we maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead. We may not be able to or choose not to adjust these fixed costs to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Our gross margin is therefore significantly affected by our sales volume and the corresponding utilization of capacity and absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses.

Sales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of costs related to compensation, trade shows, professional and technical conferences, travel, facilities, depreciation of equipment used for demonstration purposes and other marketing costs.
Research and development. Our research and development expense consists primarily of compensation, development expenses related to the design of our products and certain components, the cost of materials and components to build prototype devices for testing and facilities costs. Costs related to product development are recorded as research and development expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
General and administrative. Our general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and other administrative personnel, outside legal and professional fees, insurance premiums and fees, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses such as charges and benefits related to the change in allowance for doubtful debt.
Factors and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results
In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance.
Net sales. Our net sales grew from $901.3 million in 2015 to $1,459.9 million in 2018, representing a three year compound annual growth rate of approximately 17%. Net sales growth was driven by (i) increasing demand for our products, fueled by their superior performance and decreasing average cost per watt of output power which has resulted in a substantial improvement in their competitiveness and increased market share compared not only to other laser technologies including CO2 and YAG lasers but also to compared to non-laser machine tools and processes such as punches, presses, dies and traditional welding technologies, (ii) increased sales of fiber lasers for cutting and welding applications and the development of OEM customers in these applications, (iii) the introduction of new products, including our high power lasers with higher output power levels, quasi-continuous wave ("QCW") lasers, laser systems, high power pulsed lasers and optical heads and other accessories and (iv) the development of new applications for our products some of which displace non-laser technologies. Our annual revenue growth rates have varied. Net sales increased by 4%, 40% and 12% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by our customers, particularly by manufacturers using our products for materials processing, which includes general manufacturing, automotive, other transportation, aerospace, heavy industry, consumer, semiconductor and electronics. Approximately 94% of our revenues in 2018 were from customers using our products for materials processing. Although applications within materials processing are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by customers for materials processing and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending.
Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers, the shipment, installation and acceptance of products at our customers' facilities, the mix of OEM orders and one-time orders for products with large purchase prices, competitive pressures, acquisitions, economic and political conditions in a certain country or region and seasonal factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity throughout the year in the regions where we operate. Historically, our net sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although that trend did not occur in 2018 due to a decrease in capital equipment spending in Europe and China caused by slower macro-economic growth and uncertainty caused by the trade war between the United States and China. Net sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products for use in new applications in the end markets that we serve. The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for a period, which may then slow until we penetrate new markets or obtain new customers. Sales in the telecom business may tend to be driven by large projects and technology upgrades, which can be uneven and result in material increases or decreases over prior periods. The revenues from such projects and upgrades also are subject to risks greater than our core materials processing business
Gross margin. Our total gross margin in any period can be significantly affected by total net sales in any period, by product mix, by sales mix between OEM customers who purchase devices from us in high unit volumes and other customers, by mix of sales in different geographies, by competitive factors and by other factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, some of which are not under our control.
Our gross margin can be significantly affected by product mix. Within each of our product categories, the gross margin is generally higher for devices with greater average power. These higher power products often have better performance, more difficult specifications to attain and fewer competing products in the marketplace. Higher power lasers also use a greater number of optical components, improving absorption of fixed overhead costs and enabling economies of scale in manufacturing. The gross margin for certain specialty products may be higher because there are fewer or sometimes no

 equivalent competing products. Customers that purchase devices in greater unit volumes generally receive lower prices per device than customers that purchase fewer units. These lower selling prices to high unit volume customers may be partially offset by the improved absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with larger product volumes, which drive economies of scale in manufacturing. Finally, gross margin on systems and communication components can be lower than margins for our laser and amplifier sources, depending on the configuration, volume and competitive forces, among other factors.
We believe our strategy to maintain and extend our leadership position will result in industry-leading revenue growth and profitability. Although our fiber laser technology has a leading market position within select materials processing applications, our share within many other laser applications is significantly smaller and non-existent in many other applications. We estimate fiber lasers comprise less than 35% of total laser source sales and that laser-based machine tools comprise less than 25% of all machine tools used for cutting and welding of metals. Given the potential for our fiber laser technology to gain deeper penetration within the broader markets we serve and plan to target, we continue to introduce and acquire new technologies, products and systems to expand our market presence. We expect that some new technologies, products and systems will have returns above our cost of capital but may have gross margins below our corporate average. If we are able to develop opportunities that are significant in size, competitively advantageous or leverage our existing technology base and leadership, our current gross margin levels may not be maintained. Instead, we aim to deliver industry-leading levels of gross and operating margins by growing our market position across the broader markets we serve.
The mix of sales between OEM customers and other customers can affect gross margin because we provide sales price discounts on products based on the number of units ordered. As the number of OEM customers increase and the number of units ordered increases, the average sales price per unit will be reduced. We expect that the impact of reduced sales price per unit will be offset by the manufacturing efficiency provided by high unit volume orders, but the timing and extent of achieving these efficiencies may not always match the mix of sales in any given time period or be realized at all.
We invested $160.3 million, $126.5 million and $127.0 million in capital expenditures in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Most of this investment relates to expansion of our manufacturing capacity and, to a lesser extent, research and development and sales-related facilities.
A high proportion of our costs is fixed so costs are generally difficult to adjust or may take time to adjust in response to changes in demand. In addition, our fixed costs increase as we expand our capacity. If we expand capacity faster than is required by sales growth, gross margins could be negatively affected. Gross margins generally decline if production volumes are lower as a result of a decrease in sales or a reduction in inventory because the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs will be reduced. Gross margins generally improve when the opposite occurs. If both sales and inventory decrease in the same period, the decline in gross margin may be greater if we cannot reduce fixed costs or choose not to reduce fixed costs to match the decrease in the level of production. If we experience a decline in sales that reduces absorption of our fixed costs, or if we have production issues, our gross margins will be negatively affected.
We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or are determined to be excess. Any provision for such slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded provisions for slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory totaling $13.0 million, $16.9 million and $22.8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Sales and marketing expense. We expect to continue to expand our worldwide direct sales organization, build and expand applications centers, hire additional sales and marketing personnel at our existing and new geographic locations as well as to support sales of new product lines, increase the number of units for demonstration purposes and otherwise increase expenditures on sales and marketing activities in order to support the growth in our net sales. As such, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the aggregate.
Research and development expense. We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products, systems and applications technology. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period. In general, if net sales continue to increase we expect research and development expense to increase in the aggregate.
General and administrative expense. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to invest in systems and resources in management, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and administration to support our worldwide operations and our acquisition strategy. Legal expenses vary from quarter to quarter based primarily upon the level of transaction activities and litigation.
Major customers. While we have historically depended on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net sales, the composition of this group can change from year to year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a percentage of our annual net sales were 26%, 28% and 22% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our largest customer accounted for 12%,

39

Table of Contents
 13% and 9% of our net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We seek to add new customers and to expand our relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the composition of our significant customers will continue to change. We generally do not enter into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase a fixed number or large volume of our fiber lasers or amplifiers. If any of our significant customers were to substantially reduce their purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, which may materially affect our operating results and financial position. We have identified the following items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, inventory valuation, warranty, and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue Recognition — Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer occurs in an amount reflecting the consideration that we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve this core principle, we apply the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.
We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price, as more fully described in Note 1, "Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition," in our consolidated financial statements. Revenue is generally recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when our performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment but which can occur over time for certain of our systems contracts. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer, but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. With the acquisition of Genesis in December 2018, we enter into contracts to sell customized robotic systems, for which revenue is generally recognized over time, depending on the terms of the contract. Recognizing revenue over time for these contracts is based on our judgment that the customized robotic system does not have an alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.  Recognizing revenue over time also estimation of the progress towards completion based on the projected costs for the contract.
Inventory — Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value. Inventory includes parts and components that may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence. We maintain a reserve for excess or obsolete inventory items. The reserve is based upon a review of inventory materials on hand, which we compare with historic usage, estimated future usage and age. In addition, we review the inventory and compare recorded costs with estimates of current market value. Write-downs are recorded to reduce the carrying value to the net realizable value with respect to any part with costs in excess of current market value. Estimating demand and current market values is inherently difficult, particularly given that we make highly specialized components and products. We determine the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory by making our best estimate considering the current quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for this inventory to support future sales of our products. We often have limited information on which to base our forecasts. If future sales differ from these forecasts, the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory may change and additional inventory provisions may be required. Because of our vertical integration, a significant or sudden decrease in sales could result in a significant change in the estimates of excess or obsolete inventory valuation.
Warranty — We maintain an accrual for warranty claims for units sold that are subject to warranty. We estimate this accrual considering past claims experience, the number of units still carrying warranty coverage and the average life of the remaining warranty period. A change in the rate of warranty repairs or when warranty is generally incurred during the warranty period could change our estimated warranty accrual and associated warranty expense.
Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes — Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and tax returns in numerous international jurisdictions. We must estimate our income tax expense after considering, among other factors, if inter-company transactions have been made on an arm’s length basis, differing tax rates between jurisdictions, allocation factors, tax credits, nondeductible items and changes in enacted tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. As we continue to expand globally, there

 is a risk that, due to complexity within and diversity among the various jurisdictions in which we do business, a governmental agency may disagree with the manner in which we have computed our taxes. Additionally, due to the lack of uniformity among all of the foreign and domestic taxing authorities, there may be situations where the tax treatment of an item in one jurisdiction is different from the tax treatment in another jurisdiction or that the transaction causes a tax liability to arise in another jurisdiction.
We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. Reserves recorded are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is "more likely than not" to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2018, we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $11.2 million that, if recognized, would be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense.

Sales for materials processing applications increased due to higher sales of high power and pulsed lasers and laser systems, partially offset by a decrease in sales of medium and low power lasers and QCW lasers.
•High power laser sales increased primarily due to growth in sales for cutting applications offset by declines in sales in welding applications. Within cutting applications, we continue to see a migration to lasers with higher output powers which improve processing speeds and enable processing of thicker materials. The shift towards lasers with higher output powers has also benefited sales due to their higher average selling prices.
•Medium and low power sales decreased due to lower sales for cutting and laser sintering applications partially offset by higher sales for welding applications. The decline in sales for cutting applications is largely due to the use of high power lasers instead of medium power lasers for these applications as the low cost cutting systems market has gravitated to higher power lasers as their selling price per watt has decreased.
•Pulsed laser sales increased due to growth in sales of high power pulsed lasers used for cutting, marking and engraving and cleaning applications partially offset by decreases in pulsed lasers used for ablation.
•QCW laser sales decreased due to lower sales for welding applications. Welding applications for QCW lasers are largely related to consumer electronics manufacturing and the investment cycle for this application was weaker in 2018 and 2017.
•Laser systems sales increased due to increases in sales for cutting systems, as well as incremental sales from the acquisition of ILT in July 2017 and the acquisition of Genesis in December 2018.
Sales for other applications increased due to higher sales of high power lasers and high power amplifiers used for advanced applications as well as increased sales of telecommunication components, including pluggable transceivers used in data transmission.

Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales increased by $47.6 million, or 7.8%, to $659.6 million in 2018 from $612.0 million in 2017. Our gross margin decreased to 54.8% in 2018 from 56.6% in 2017. Gross margin decreased due to lower absorption of manufacturing costs, decreases in average selling prices and changes in product sales mix. The impact to gross margin primarily occurred in the second half of the year in conjunction with the slowdown in sales and increased competition for certain products in China. Expenses related to provisions for excess or obsolete inventory and other valuation adjustments decreased by $3.9 million to $13.0 million, or 0.9% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $16.9 million, or 1.2% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $8.0 million, or 16.1%, to $57.8 million in 2018 from $49.8 million in 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, depreciation, trade show and exhibitions, and travel expense. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 4.0% in 2018 from 3.5% in 2017. As we continue to expand our worldwide sales organization, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the aggregate.
Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $21.9 million, or 21.7%, to $122.8 million in 2018 from $100.9 million in 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, materials, contractors, consultants, depreciation and other research and development expense. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes and developing manufacturing of new components such as crystals and refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields and productivity. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as UV, visible and mid-IR, lasers with ultrafast pulses, laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding and cutting heads and components such as ASICs used in pluggable transceivers in the telecom industry. In addition to new products research and development is focused on enhancing the performance of our existing products by improving their electrical efficiency and increasing their average power. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 8.4% in 2018 from 7.2% in 2017. We expect to continue to invest in research and development and that research and development expense will increase in the aggregate.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $21.7 million, or 26.9%, to $102.4 million in 2018 from $80.7 million in 2017, primarily as a result of increased expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation, professional services expenses related to acquisitions, accounting legal and information technology expenses, and depreciation expense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 7.0% in 2018 from 5.7% in 2017. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we invest to support the expected growth in net sales.
Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating expenses. We estimate that if exchange rates had been the same as one year ago, sales in 2018 would have been $35.8 million lower, gross margin would have been $23.3 million lower and operating expenses in total would have been $1.3 million higher. These estimates assume constant exchange rates between fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017 and are calculated using the average exchange rates for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 for the respective currencies, which were US$1=Euro 0.89, US$1=Japanese Yen 112, US$1=Chinese Yuan 6.76 and US$1=Russian Ruble 58.
Loss (gain) on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange gain of $6.2 million in 2018 as compared to a loss of $14.5 million in 2017. The change was primarily attributable to the depreciation of the Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar, which was partially offset by depreciation of the Chinese Yuan as compared to the U.S. Dollar.

Interest income (expense), net. Interest income (expense), net increased to $9.1 million of income in 2018 compared to $0.7 million of income in 2017. The increase of interest income was the result of the repatriation of $522 million of cash during the year from Germany to the United States and improved rate of return on U.S. Dollar denominated investments as compared to Euro denominated investments.
Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net increased to approximately $2 million in 2018 while in 2017 it was an insignificant amount.
Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $130.2 million in 2018 compared to $204.3 million in 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 24.4% in 2018 and 37.0% in 2017. The decreased effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in the statutory tax rate in the United States from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). Discrete adjustments in 2018 include (i) a decrease to tax expense of $13.3 million related to equity based compensation deductions for tax in excess of the deductions reflected in book income; (ii) an increase to tax expense of $6.6 million related to U.S. tax on profits earned in 2017 calculated at the prior year federal rate of 35% flowing through consolidated income in 2018; and, (iii) an increase in the valuation allowance of $7.4 million primarily for state credits. Discrete adjustments in 2017 include (i) a decrease to tax expense of $14.0 million related to equity based compensation deductions for tax in excess of the deductions reflected in book income and (ii) an increase to tax expense of $48.1 million for a U.S. tax on cumulative foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Act.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (iii) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (iv) providing an incentive benefit for U.S. income from intangibles (Foreign Derived Intangible Income); (v) increasing U.S. taxable income to include all income earned by foreign subsidiaries in excess of ten percent of the fixed assets in those entities (Global Intangible Low-taxed Income) and (vi) providing for bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property.
Our final calculation of the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax ("Transition Tax") element of the Tax Act is a $43.4 million increase to the tax expense. At December 31, 2017, we calculated a provisional amount of tax for this at $48.1 million and have included a benefit of $4.7 million in 2018 income tax expense to reflect the impact of the decrease in liability. The federal Transition Tax is payable over eight years and $30.3 million of the liability is included in other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2018.
Net income. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation increased by $56.4 million to $404.0 million in 2018 from $347.6 million in 2017. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales increased by 3.0% to 27.7% in 2018 from 24.7% in 2017 due to the factors described above.

Sales for materials processing applications increased due to higher sales of high power lasers, medium power lasers, pulsed lasers, QCW lasers and laser systems.
•The increase in high power laser sales related to growth in cutting and welding. High power lasers continue to displace CO2 lasers. We believe our revenue growth has benefited from an accelerated replacement cycle for older CO2 based cutting systems and also from displacement of non-laser technologies, which has resulted in higher demand for the fiber based cutting and welding systems sold by our OEM customers. Within cutting applications, we continue to see a migration to lasers with higher output powers which improve processing speeds and enable processing of thicker materials. The shift towards lasers with higher output powers has also benefited sales due to their higher average selling prices.
•Medium and low power sales increased due to growth in laser sintering and fine welding applications, which was partially offset by decreases in sales for fine cutting applications because fine cutting systems using medium power lasers migrated to using high power 1 to 2 kilowatt lasers. Average selling prices for medium power lasers also declined.
•Pulsed laser sales increased due to growth in marking and engraving, cleaning and stripping, solar cell manufacturing and cutting applications. Within the pulsed laser category, the rate of sales increases was larger for high power pulsed lasers than for pulsed lasers with lower average power.
•The increase in laser systems sales was mainly driven by the July 2017 acquisition of ILT.
•QCW laser sales increased due to the demand for welding and drilling applications. Welding applications for QCW lasers are primarily related to consumer electronics.
•Materials processing sales also increased as a result of parts and service sales, which are included in Other Revenue in the Sales by Product chart above.
Sales for other applications increased due to higher sales for telecom and advanced applications. Telecom sales benefited from an increase in sales of pluggable transceivers used in data transmission and an increase in amplifier sales used for last mile fiber access to the home applications. For 2017, the rate of growth of telecom sales benefited from the contribution of sales by Menara, which we acquired in May 2016. Sales of telecom products are included in Other Revenue in the Sales by Product chart above. Advanced application sales are typically uneven from quarter to quarter. The increase in advanced applications sales was driven by increase in demand from defense, semiconductor and scientific applications across various product lines.

1.The substantial majority of sales in North America are to customers in the United States.

Sales for China increased year over year driven by high power CW lasers for cutting and welding (including electric vehicle battery welding) and QCW lasers for consumer electronics. China cutting sales were also driven by strong growth in the ultra high power market at 6 kilowatts or greater power and the lower cost cutting market for power levels at 1 to 3 kilowatts.
Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales increased by $158.0 million, or 34.8%, to $612.0 million in 2017 from $453.9 million in 2016. Our gross margin increased to 56.6% in 2017 from 54.9% in 2016. Gross margin increased due to a decrease in the cost of internally manufactured components, increased manufacturing efficiency and product mix which included increased sales of high power, QCW and pulsed lasers with higher average powers. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by lower average selling prices. Expenses related to provisions for excess or obsolete inventory and other valuation adjustments decreased by $5.9 million to $16.9 million, or 1.2% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $22.8 million, or 2.3% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $11.4 million, or 29.7%, to $49.8 million in 2017 from $38.4 million in 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, trade show and exhibitions, travel and depreciation expense. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense decreased to 3.5% in 2017 from 3.8% in 2016. As we continue to expand our worldwide sales organization, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the aggregate.
Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $22.3 million, or 28.4%, to $100.9 million in 2017 from $78.6 million in 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, contractors, consultants, materials, depreciation and other research and development expense. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes and developing manufacturing of new components such as crystals and refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields and productivity. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as UV, visible and mid-IR, lasers with ultrafast pulses, laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding and cutting heads. In addition to new products research and development is focused on enhancing the performance of our existing products by improving their electrical efficiency and increasing their average power. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense decreased to 7.2% in 2017 from 7.8% in 2016. We expect to continue to invest in research and development and that research and development expense will increase in the aggregate.
General and administrative expense.  General and administrative expense increased by $14.2 million, or 21.3%, to $80.7 million in 2017 from $66.5 million in 2016, primarily as a result of increased expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation, accounting, subscription fees, recruitment, information technology, travel and depreciation expense. In 2016, general and administrative expense also includes a non-cash impairment charge of $2.9 million related to our corporate aircraft. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense decreased to 5.7% in 2017 from 6.6% in 2016. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we invest to support the expected growth in net sales.
Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating expenses. We estimate that if exchange rates had been the same as one year ago, sales in 2017 would have been $2.0 million higher, gross margin would have been $4.3 million higher and operating expenses in total would have been $3.7 million lower. These estimates assume constant exchange rates between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016 and are calculated using the average exchange rates for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 for the respective currencies, which were US$1=Euro 0.90, US$1=Japanese Yen 109, US$1=Chinese Yuan 6.65 and US$1=Russian Ruble 67.

Table of Contents
Loss (gain) on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange loss of $14.5 million in 2017 as compared to a loss of $4.5 million in 2016. The change was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Euro and Russian Ruble as compared to the U.S. Dollar, which was partially offset by appreciation of the Chinese Yuan as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
Interest income (expense), net. Interest income (expense), net decreased to $0.7 million of income in 2017 compared to $1.3 million of income in 2016.
Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net decreased to approximately $0 in 2017 compared to $0.9 million of income in 2016 as a result of the loss incurred upon sale of available-for-sale-securities being partially offset by increases in net rental income from a building in the United States purchased in the second quarter of 2016 that is partially leased to third parties.
Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $204.3 million in 2017 compared to $105.8 million in 2016, representing an effective tax rate of 37.0% in 2017 and 28.9% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the amounts recorded upon adoption of the Tax Act including $47.0 million of accrued federal Transition Taxes for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries with an associated $1.1 million state tax liability and a $1.3 million write down of deferred tax assets as a result of the rate reductions in the Tax Act. In addition, the provision for income taxes includes a $4.4 million provision for uncertain tax positions. These increases in the provision for income taxes were partially offset by $14.6 million of excess tax benefits related to exercise of stock options and release of restricted stock units which vested during the period.
Effective as of the beginning of 2017, the accounting standard related to excess tax benefits and deficits changed, and these items are now recognized in the provision for income taxes whereas previously they were accounted for within additional paid-in capital. The tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the benefits taken on our tax return which will depend upon the quantity and intrinsic value of RSUs that vest and options that are exercised in the period. Additionally, we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and we anticipate that our effective rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the factors described above.
Net income. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation increased by $86.8 million to $347.6 million in 2017 from $260.8 million in 2016. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales decreased by 1.2% to 24.7% in 2017 from 25.9% in 2016 due to the factors described above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2018 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $544.4 million, short-term investments of $500.4 million, unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of $107.4 million and working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) of $514.9 million . This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $909.9 million, short-term investments of $206.3 million, unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of $111.0 million and working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) of $439.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $71.4 million from $1,116.2 million to $1,044.8 million relates primarily to cash provided by operating activities in 2018 of $393.3 million, which was offset by cash used in investing activities of $563.0 million and cash used in financing activities of $166.6 million.
Short-term investments at December 31, 2018, consist of liquid investments including U.S. government and government agency notes, corporate notes, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year. We also hold long-term investments, included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, which consist of the corporate bonds detailed above with maturities of less than two years and auction rate securities totaling $4.7 million.
Our long-term debt consists of two long-term notes with a combined total outstanding balance at December 31, 2018 of $45.4 million of which $3.7 million is the current portion. We have an unsecured note with an outstanding balance at December 31, 2018 of $20.8 million of which $1.2 million is the current portion. The interest on this unsecured note is variable at 1.20% above LIBOR and is fixed using an interest rate swap at 2.85% per annum. The unsecured note matures in May 2023, at which time the outstanding debt balance will be $15.4 million. We have another note that is secured by our corporate aircraft. The outstanding balance on this secured note at December 31, 2018 was $24.6 million of which $2.5 million is the current portion. The interest rate on this secured note is fixed at 2.74% per annum and it matures in July 2022, at which time the outstanding debt balance will be $15.4 million.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit provide us with the financial flexibility to meet our liquidity and capital needs, as well as to complete

 certain acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities based upon market conditions and the strategic importance and valuation of the target company. We may consider issuing debt to finance acquisitions depending on the timing and size of the acquisition among other reasons. Our future long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors including our level of sales, the impact of economic environment on our sales levels, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of the global sales and marketing activities, government regulation including trade sanctions, the timing and introduction of new products, the need to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products.
The following table details our line-of-credit facilities as of December 31, 2018:

---------------------------------- --------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------- ---------- -------------------------------------------------------------

1.This facility is available to certain foreign subsidiaries in their respective local currencies. At December 31, 2018, there were no amounts drawn on this line, however, there were $0.9 million of guarantees issued against the line which reduces total availability.
2.This facility is available to certain foreign subsidiaries in their respective local currencies. At December 31, 2018, there were no drawings, however, there were $1.2 million of guarantees issued against the line which reduces total availability.
3.At December 31, 2018, there were no drawings.
Our largest committed credit lines are with Bank of America N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG in the amounts of $50.0 million and $57.2 million (or 50 million Euro as described above), respectively, and neither of them is syndicated.
We are required to meet certain financial covenants associated with our U.S. revolving line of credit and long-term debt facilities. These covenants, tested quarterly, include a debt service coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio. The debt service coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as required principal and interest payments during the period. Debt service in the calculation is decreased by our cash held in the U.S.A. in excess of $50 million up to a maximum of $250 million. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than two times our trailing twelve months EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2018.
The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to not take or to delay investments and actions that we might otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt or a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
Operating activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $12.1 million to $393.3 million in 2018 from $405.4 million in 2017. In 2018, net sales and net income grew by 4% and 16%, respectively. As the business and net income has grown, cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges has increased. This increase has been partially offset by continued increases in working capital to support the growth of the business. Our largest working capital items are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory because of the amount of value added within IPG due to our vertically integrated structure. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes payable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. The increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2018 primarily resulted from:

48

Table of Contents
•An increase in cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges of $540.5 million in 2018 as compared to $512.0 million in 2017; and
•An increase in cash due to an increase in income and other taxes payable of $35.2 million in 2018 compared with a decrease of $16.7 million in 2017; and
•A decrease in cash used by accounts receivable of $18.8 million in 2018 as compared to $63.2 million in 2017; and
•An increase in cash used by inventory of $135.4 million in 2018 as compared to $71.1 million in 2017 due to an increase in inventory.
Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming testing procedures for both internally manufactured and externally purchased components and the lead time required to manufacture components used in our finished products, the rate at which we turn inventory has historically been comparatively low when compared to our cost of sales. Also, our historic growth rates required investment in inventories to support future sales and enable us to quote short delivery times to our customers, providing what we believe is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, if there was a disruption to the manufacturing capacity of any of our key technologies, our inventories of components should enable us to continue to build finished products for a reasonable period of time. We believe that we will continue to maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result, we expect to have a significant amount of working capital invested in inventory. A reduction in our level of net sales or the rate of growth of our net sales from their current levels would mean that the rate at which we are able to convert our inventory into cash would decrease.
Investing activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $563.0 million and $170.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in 2018 related to $295.0 million of net purchases of investments after the repatriation of cash from our German subsidiary, $160.3 million for property, plant and equipment and $109.1 million for the acquisition of three businesses during 2018, net of cash acquired. The cash used in investing activities in 2017 related to $126.5 million for property, plant and equipment, including the purchase of a new corporate aircraft, and $60.5 million for the acquisition of two businesses, net of cash acquired. These cash uses were partially offset by $15.9 million of cash generated by the sale of fixed assets, primarily the previous corporate aircraft.
In 2019, we expect to incur approximately $170 million to $180 million in capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. Capital expenditures include investments in property, facilities and equipment to add capacity worldwide to support anticipated revenue growth. The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. If we obtain financing for certain projects, our cash expenditures would be reduced in the year of expenditure. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period.
Financing activities.    Net cash used in financing activities was $166.6 million and $3.4 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cash used in financing activities in 2018 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $176.1 million and payments on our long-term borrowings of $3.6 million. These cash uses were partially offset by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan of $12.2 million. The cash used in financing activities in 2017 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $40.0 million and payments on our long-term borrowings of $19.8 million, the majority of which related to repayment of the long-term note secured by our previous corporate aircraft. These cash uses were partially offset by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan of $28.7 million and proceeds of debt issued to fund the new corporate aircraft purchase of $28.0 million.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2  For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 8

[") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, which may materially affect our operating results and financial position. We have identified the following items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, inventory valuation, warranty, and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue Recognition — Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer occurs in an amount reflecting the consideration that we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve this core principle, we apply the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.
We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price, as more fully described in Note 1, "]:

[") ratio. The debt service coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as required principal and interest payments during the period. Debt service in the calculation is decreased by our cash held in the U.S.A. in excess of $50 million up to a maximum of $250 million. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than two times our trailing twelve months EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2018.
The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to not take or to delay investments and actions that we might otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt or a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
Operating activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $12.1 million to $393.3 million in 2018 from $405.4 million in 2017. In 2018, net sales and net income grew by 4% and 16%, respectively. As the business and net income has grown, cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges has increased. This increase has been partially offset by continued increases in working capital to support the growth of the business. Our largest working capital items are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory because of the amount of value added within IPG due to our vertically integrated structure. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes payable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. The increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2018 primarily resulted from:

Table of Contents
•An increase in cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges of $540.5 million in 2018 as compared to $512.0 million in 2017; and
•An increase in cash due to an increase in income and other taxes payable of $35.2 million in 2018 compared with a decrease of $16.7 million in 2017; and
•A decrease in cash used by accounts receivable of $18.8 million in 2018 as compared to $63.2 million in 2017; and
•An increase in cash used by inventory of $135.4 million in 2018 as compared to $71.1 million in 2017 due to an increase in inventory.
Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming testing procedures for both internally manufactured and externally purchased components and the lead time required to manufacture components used in our finished products, the rate at which we turn inventory has historically been comparatively low when compared to our cost of sales. Also, our historic growth rates required investment in inventories to support future sales and enable us to quote short delivery times to our customers, providing what we believe is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, if there was a disruption to the manufacturing capacity of any of our key technologies, our inventories of components should enable us to continue to build finished products for a reasonable period of time. We believe that we will continue to maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result, we expect to have a significant amount of working capital invested in inventory. A reduction in our level of net sales or the rate of growth of our net sales from their current levels would mean that the rate at which we are able to convert our inventory into cash would decrease.
Investing activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $563.0 million and $170.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in 2018 related to $295.0 million of net purchases of investments after the repatriation of cash from our German subsidiary, $160.3 million for property, plant and equipment and $109.1 million for the acquisition of three businesses during 2018, net of cash acquired. The cash used in investing activities in 2017 related to $126.5 million for property, plant and equipment, including the purchase of a new corporate aircraft, and $60.5 million for the acquisition of two businesses, net of cash acquired. These cash uses were partially offset by $15.9 million of cash generated by the sale of fixed assets, primarily the previous corporate aircraft.
In 2019, we expect to incur approximately $170 million to $180 million in capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. Capital expenditures include investments in property, facilities and equipment to add capacity worldwide to support anticipated revenue growth. The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. If we obtain financing for certain projects, our cash expenditures would be reduced in the year of expenditure. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period.
Financing activities.    Net cash used in financing activities was $166.6 million and $3.4 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cash used in financing activities in 2018 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $176.1 million and payments on our long-term borrowings of $3.6 million. These cash uses were partially offset by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan of $12.2 million. The cash used in financing activities in 2017 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $40.0 million and payments on our long-term borrowings of $19.8 million, the majority of which related to repayment of the long-term note secured by our previous corporate aircraft. These cash uses were partially offset by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan of $28.7 million and proceeds of debt issued to fund the new corporate aircraft purchase of $28.0 million.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. The following summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands):
