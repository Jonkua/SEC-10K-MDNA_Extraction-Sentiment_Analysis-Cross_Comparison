ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our “Selected Financial Data” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read “Part I, Item 1.A Risk Factors” in this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.

Overview

We are a leading provider of temporary mechanical circulatory support devices, and we offer a continuum of care to heart failure patients. We develop, manufacture and market proprietary products that are designed to enable the heart to rest, heal and recover by improving blood flow to the coronary arteries and end-organs and/or temporarily assisting the pumping function of the heart. Our products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab, or cath lab, by interventional cardiologists, the electrophysiology lab, the hybrid lab and in the heart surgery suite by cardiac surgeons. A physician may use our devices for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support prophylactically, urgently or emergently before, during or after angioplasty or heart surgery procedures. We believe that heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome for a patient experiencing heart failure because it enhances the potential for the patient to go home with their own heart, facilitating the restoration of quality of life. In addition, we believe that, for the care of such patients, heart recovery is often the most cost-effective solution for the healthcare system.

Our strategic focus and the driver of our revenue growth is the market penetration of our family of Impella® heart pumps. The Impella device portfolio, which includes the Impella 2.5®, Impella CP®, Impella RP®, Impella LD® and Impella 5.0® devices, has supported numerous patients worldwide. We expect that all of our product and service revenue in the near future will be from our Impella devices.

Our Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella CP and Impella RP devices have FDA, CE Mark and Health Canada approval, which allows us to market these devices in the U.S., European Union and Canada. Our Impella 2.5, Impella 5.0 and Impella CP devices have regulatory approval from the MHLW. We expect to continue to make additional PMA supplement submissions for our Impella portfolio of devices for additional indications.

In July 2017, we received approval from the MHLW for reimbursement for the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 heart pumps in Japan. Reimbursement in Japan for the Impella 2.5 and 5.0 is equivalent to our average Impella sales price in the U.S. We continue to focus on our controlled commercial launch of Impella devices in Japan.

In September 2017, we received a PMA from the FDA for the Impella RP heart pump. The Impella RP heart pump is indicated for providing temporary right ventricular support for up to 14 days in patients with a body surface area ≥1.5 m², who develop acute right heart failure or decompensation following left ventricular assist device implantation, myocardial infarction, heart transplant, or open-heart surgery. With this approval, the Impella RP heart pump is the only percutaneous temporary ventricular support device that is FDA-approved as safe and effective for right heart failure.

In February 2018, we received two expanded PMAs from the FDA for our Impella heart pumps. The first expanded approval is for use of Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD heart pumps on patients with cardiogenic shock associated with cardiomyopathy, including peripartum and postpartum cardiomyopathy.  The second expanded PMA is for use of the Impella 2.5 and Impella CP heart pumps during elective and high-risk PCI procedures.  This expanded PMA confirms Impella support as appropriate in patients with severe coronary artery disease, complex anatomy and extensive comorbidities, with or without depressed ejection fraction.

In April 2018, we received FDA approval for our Impella CP SmartAssistTM platform. The SmartAssist platform includes optical sensor technology for improved positioning, the use of algorithms that enable improved native heart assessment during the weaning process and cloud-based technology that enables secure, real-time, remote viewing of the Impella console for physicians and hospital staff from anywhere with internet connectivity. The platform is intended to provide enhanced monitoring capability, reduce setup time and improve ease of use for physicians. The SmartAssist platform is also approved under CE Mark in the European Union and other countries that require a CE Mark approval.  We have begun a controlled roll-out of the SmartAssist platform at certain hospital sites.

In November 2018, we announced the results of our FDA-approved prospective multi-center feasibility study, “STEMI Door to Unloading with Impella CP system in acute myocardial infarction” (STEMI DTU).  The trial focused on the feasibility and safety of unloading the left ventricle using the Impella CP heart pump prior to primary PCI in patients presenting with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, or STEMI, without cardiogenic shock with the hypothesis that this will potentially reduce infarct size. The study, which received FDA investigational device approval to proceed in October 2016, enrolled 50 patients at 10 sites. The hypothesis of this novel approach to treating STEMI patients, based on extensive mechanistic research, is that unloading the left ventricle prior to PCI reduces myocardial work load, oxygen demand and initiates a cardio-protective effect at the myocardial cell level, which may alleviate myocardial damage caused by reperfusion injury at the time of revascularization. The intent of this study was to help refine the protocol and lay the groundwork for a future pivotal study with more sites and patients and will be designed for statistical significance.

In April 2019, the FDA approved the initiation of the STEMI DTU pivotal randomized controlled trial. The prospective, multi-center, two-arm trial plans to enroll 668 patients undergoing treatment for a STEMI heart attack. Half the patients will be randomized to receive delayed reperfusion after 30 minutes of left ventricular unloading with the Impella CP. The other half will receive immediate reperfusion, the current standard of care. The trial will test the hypothesis that unloading the left ventricle for 30 minutes prior to reperfusion will reduce myocardial damage from a heart attack and lead to a reduction in future heart failure related events. We expect this trial to begin in October 2019 and we estimate that it will take three to four years to complete enrollment. The trial allows for an adaptive design, which permits adjustments to the study sample size after an interim analysis.

In January 2019, we proactively sent physicians who use Impella RP post-approval study data that provides additional evidence of the benefits of following proper protocols for placement of Impella RP such as early placement and following proper inclusion and exclusion criteria when selecting patients for Impella RP. In February 2019, the FDA released a letter to health care providers on the Impella RP heart pump reiterating to physicians to follow proper protocols for the use of Impella RP. In March 2019, we presented survival data from the 18-month post-approval study of 42 Impella RP patients at the American College of Cardiology’s Annual Scientific Session. This interim post-approval study data showed an improved survival rate for cardiogenic shock patients who followed the Recover Right protocol, which are patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the Recover Right FDA PMA trial, when compared to salvage patients outside the Recover Right protocol (>48 hours in cardiogenic shock from right side failure). In May 2019, the FDA issued an update to its February 2019 letter to inform the health care community of these interim post-approval study results which validated that the Impella RP heart pump is safe and effective for the treatment of right heart failure. The data showed a 64% survival rate and 90% heart recovery for the subgroup of PAS patients who met the enrollment criteria of Impella RP’s premarket clinical studies. Impella RP is the most studied right-sided device and the only percutaneous technology with FDA approval designating it as safe and effective for right heart support.

In March 2019, we received PMDA approval from MHLW for our Impella CP heart pump in Japan.  We expect to start selling the Impella CP heart pump as an additional product offering in Japan later in calendar year 2019.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The accounting policies we believe are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements relate to revenue recognition and income taxes. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in “Note 2. Basis of Preparation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements in this report.

38

Revenue Recognition

Effective April 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2014-09 (“Topic 606”), “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. For a discussion on the impact of this accounting policy adoption, including key accounting policy elections, see “Note 3. Revenue Recognition” to our consolidated financial statements in this report.

Revenue is recognized when, or as, obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers.  Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer.

Product revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract.

Service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are rendered to the customer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We recognize service revenue over the term of the service contract. Services are expected to be transferred to the customer throughout the term of the contract and we believe recognizing revenue ratably over the term of the contract best depicts the transfer of value to the customer. Revenue generated from preventative maintenance calls is recognized at a point in time when the services are provided to the customer.

Revenue from the sale of products and services are evidenced by either a contract with the customer or a valid purchase order or an invoice which includes all relevant terms of sale. We perform a review of each specific customer's credit worthiness and ability to pay prior to acceptance as a customer. Further, we perform periodic reviews of customers' creditworthiness.

Income Taxes

Our provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years as the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to impact taxable income.

We regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. We consider whether a valuation allowance is needed on our deferred tax assets by evaluating all positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results.

We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit at the largest amount that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis, when applicable. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, new information and technical insights, and changes in tax laws. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. When applicable, we accrue for the effects of uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest through income tax expense.

Effective April 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, recognition of stock compensation award forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, the calculation of diluted shares outstanding and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The effects of this impact will be hard to predict and variable moving forward as such effects are dependent upon actual stock option exercises.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is included in “Note 2. Basis of Preparation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements in this report.

Revenue

The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by products and services:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
------------------------- ---------------------------- ------- - -------
 2019 2018
 (in $000's)
Impella product revenue $ 741,699 $ 570,870
Service and other revenue 27,733 22,879
Total revenue $ 769,432 $ 593,749

The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by geographical location:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
--------------------- ---------------------------- ------- - -------
 2019 2018
 (in $000's)
U.S. revenue $ 665,082 $ 526,685
International revenue 104,350 67,064
Total revenue $ 769,432 $ 593,749

Impella product revenue encompasses Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella RP and Impella AIC console sales. Service and other revenue represents revenue earned on service maintenance contracts and preventative maintenance calls.

Total revenue for fiscal 2019 increased $175.7 million, or 30%, to $769.4 million from $593.7 million for fiscal 2018. Impella product revenue for fiscal 2019 increased by $170.8 million, or 30%, to $741.7 million from $570.9 million for fiscal 2018. Most of the increase in Impella product revenue was from increased device sales in the U.S., as we focus on increasing utilization of our disposable catheter products through continued investment in our field organization and physician training programs. Impella product revenue outside of the U.S. also increased primarily due to higher utilization in Germany and our controlled launch of Impella 2.5 and Impella 5.0 in Japan.

Service and other revenue for fiscal 2019 increased by $4.8 million, or 21%, to $27.7 million from $22.9 million for fiscal 2018. The increase in service and other revenue was primarily due to an increase in preventative maintenance service contracts. We expect growth for service and other revenue to be slower than our Impella product revenue in the near future as most of our U.S. customers have service contracts with three-year terms.

40

Costs and Expenses

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue for fiscal 2019 increased by $31.0 million, or 31%, to $129.6 million from $98.6 million for fiscal 2018. Gross margin was 83% for each of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. The increase in cost of product revenue was related to higher demand for our Impella devices and higher production volume and costs to support growing demand for our Impella devices. There was a minimal difference in gross margin as the increased investment in manufacturing capacity was at a pace consistent with our revenue growth.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses for fiscal 2019 increased by $18.2 million, or 24%, to $93.5 million from $75.3 million for fiscal 2018. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to product development initiatives relating to our existing products, such as optical sensor technology, the development of Impella 5.5TM and Impella ECPTM devices and related product accessories, increased clinical spending primarily related to our cVAD Study and our continued focus on quality and regulatory initiatives for our Impella devices.

We expect research and development expenses to continue to increase as we continue to increase clinical spending related to our cVAD Study and launch the STEMI pivotal study and incur additional costs as we continue to focus on engineering initiatives to improve our existing products and develop new technologies.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2019 increased by $58.9 million, or 22%, to $321.6 million from $262.7 million for fiscal 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the hiring of additional field sales and clinical personnel in the U.S. and Germany, the commercial launch in Japan, increased spending on marketing initiatives as we continue to educate physicians on the benefits of hemodynamic support after receiving PMAs in the U.S. for our Impella products, higher stock-based compensation expense and higher legal expenses related to ongoing patent litigation and other legal matters discussed in “Note 12. Commitment and Contingencies – Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements in this report.

We expect to continue to increase our expenditures on sales and marketing activities, with particular investments in field sales and clinical personnel with cath lab expertise to drive recovery awareness for acute heart failure patients. We plan to increase our marketing, service and training investments as a result of recent PMAs in the U.S. for our Impella devices and as we continue our expansion in Japan and other new markets outside of the U.S. We expect to have sizable stock-based compensation expense in the future. We also expect to continue to incur significant legal expenses in the foreseeable future related to ongoing patent litigation and other legal matters discussed in “Note 12. Commitment and Contingencies – Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements in this report.

Other Income

Other income increased by $35.2 million, to $38.5 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $3.3 million for fiscal 2018. This increase was primarily due to the recognition of a $31.2 million gain from our investment in Shockwave Medical.

Income Tax Provision

The income tax provision decreased by $44.0 million, or 91%, to $4.3 million for fiscal 2019, compared to $48.3 million for fiscal 2018. Our effective income tax rate was 1.6% in fiscal 2019, and 30.1% in fiscal 2018. The decrease in the income tax provision and the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 were primarily driven by $69.3 million in excess tax benefits in fiscal 2019, compared to $31.0 million in fiscal 2018. These excess tax benefits are related to the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation on April 1, 2017, which requires restricted stock units that vested or stock options that were exercised during the year to be recorded in the statement of operations. The decrease in income tax provision was also due to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Reform Act, which resulted in a decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate applied of 21% in fiscal 2019 from a blended rate of 31.5% in fiscal 2018.

Net Income

In fiscal 2019, we recognized net income of $259.0 million, or $5.77 per basic share and $5.61 per diluted share. Net income in fiscal 2019 included excess tax benefits related to stock-based awards of $69.3 million, or $1.54 per basic share and $1.50 per diluted share, and a $23.6 million gain, net of tax, related to our investment in Shockwave Medical.

41

In fiscal 2018, we recognized net income of $112.2 million, or $2.54 per basic share and $2.45 per diluted share. Net income in fiscal 2018 included excess tax benefits related to stock-based awards of $31.0 million, or $0.70 per basic share and $0.68 per diluted share, and income tax expense of $21.4 million, or $0.48 per basic share and $0.47 per diluted share due to the effect of implementing the Tax Reform Act.

The increase in our net income for fiscal 2019 was also driven primarily by higher Impella product revenue due to greater utilization of our Impella devices in the U.S., Germany and Japan.

Results of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017

For a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on May 24, 2018.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At March 31, 2019, our total cash, cash equivalents, and short and long-term marketable securities totaled $513.4 million, an increase of $113.6 million compared to $399.8 million at March 31, 2018. The increase in our cash, cash equivalents, and short and long-term marketable securities was primarily due to positive cash flows from operations, offset by cash used for investments in property, equipment and other investments, and cash used for financing activities related to equity activity.

A summary of our cash flow activities is as follows:

 For the Year Ended March 31,
----------------------------------------- ---------------------------- -------- - ---- - -------- -
 2019 2018
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 252,197 $ 192,546
Net cash used for investing activities (116,455 ) (180,762 )
Net cash used for financing activities (55,775 ) (9,137 )
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (1,921 ) 1,288
Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 78,046 $ 3,935

For a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources as of and our cash flow activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on May 24, 2018.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

For the year ended March 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $259.0 million as discussed above, adjusted for non-cash items of $32.0 million less cash used in working capital of $38.8 million. Adjustments for non-cash items consisted primarily of $54.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, a change in fair value of our investments in medical technology companies of $30.2 million, a $7.7 million change in our deferred tax provision, $14.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $4.3 million in inventory and other write-downs and a change in fair value of contingent consideration of $0.9 million. The decrease in cash from changes in working capital included a $22.0 million increase in accounts receivable associated with higher revenues and a $37.2 million increase in inventory to support growing demand for our Impella devices offset by a $21.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $1.5 million increase in deferred revenue.

For the year ended March 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities consisted of net income of $112.2 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $99.3 million less used in working capital of $18.9 million. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher revenue from increased utilization of our Impella devices.  Adjustments for non-cash items consisted primarily of $40.4 million of stock-based compensation expense, a $42.6 million change in deferred tax provision, $11.0 million of depreciation of property and equipment, $3.9 million in inventory and other write-downs and $1.3 million of changes in fair value of consideration. The decrease in cash from changes in working capital included a $15.3 million increase in accounts receivable associated with higher revenues and a $15.7 million increase in inventory to support growing demand for our Impella devices offset by a $12.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $4.4 million increase in deferred revenue.

42

Cash Used for Investing Activities

For the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash used for investing activities included $29.7 million in purchases (net of maturities) of marketable securities and other and $44.0 million for the purchase of property and equipment mostly related to the continued expansion of manufacturing capacity, investments in enhancing information systems, and construction and renovation of office space and research and development facilities in Danvers and Aachen. We also made $42.7 million of investments in medical technology companies and intangible assets during fiscal 2019.

For the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash used for investing activities included $118.5 million in purchases (net of maturities) of marketable securities and $55.9 million for the purchase of property and equipment mostly related to the purchase of our corporate headquarters building in Danvers, the continued expansion of manufacturing capacity, office space and research and development facilities in Danvers and Aachen, and investments in information systems. We also made $6.4 million of investments in medical technology companies during fiscal 2018.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 are estimated to range from $50 million to $60 million, including additional capital expenditures for manufacturing capacity expansions in our Danvers and Aachen facilities, additional office space, building and leasehold improvements and information systems development projects.

Cash Used for Financing Activities

For the year ended March 31, 2019, net cash used for financing activities included $71.8 million in payments in lieu of issuance of common stock for payroll withholding taxes upon vesting of certain equity awards offset by $12.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $3.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

For the year ended March 31, 2018, net cash used for financing activities included $20.3 million in payments in lieu of issuance of common stock for payroll withholding taxes upon vesting of certain equity awards offset by $9.3 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $2.4 million in proceeds from the issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan.

Operating Capital and Liquidity Requirements

We believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months, exclusive of activities involving any future acquisitions of products or companies that complement or augment our existing line of products.

Our primary liquidity requirements are to fund the expansion of our commercial and operational infrastructures, increase our manufacturing capacity, pay for additional capital expenditures as we expand our office space and manufacturing capacity in Danvers and Aachen, increase our inventory levels in order to meet growing customer demand for our Impella devices, fund new product and business development initiatives, continue our commercial launch in Japan and expand to potential new markets, increase clinical spending, cover legal expenses related to ongoing patent litigation and other legal matters, cover payments in lieu of issuance of common stock for payroll withholding taxes upon vesting of certain equity awards and provide for general working capital needs. To date, we have primarily funded our operations through product sales and the sale of equity securities.

Our liquidity is influenced by our ability to sell our products in a competitive industry and our customers’ ability to pay for our products. Factors that may affect liquidity include our ability to penetrate the market for our products, our ability to maintain or reduce the length of the selling cycle for our products, our capital expenditures, investments in collaborative arrangements with other partners, and our ability to collect cash from customers after our products are sold. We also expect to continue to incur legal expenses for the foreseeable future related to ongoing patent litigation and other legal matters. We continue to review our short-term and long-term cash needs on a regular basis. At March 31, 2019, we had no long-term debt outstanding.

Marketable securities at March 31, 2019 consisted of $392.4 million held in funds that invest in U.S. Treasury, commercial paper, government-backed securities and corporate debt securities. We are not a party to any interest rate swaps, currency hedges or derivative contracts of any type and we currently have no exposure to auction rate securities markets.

Cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $25.2 million and $13.3 million at March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, respectively. Our operating income outside the U.S. is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. The recently enacted Tax Reform Act allows for a 100% deduction for the repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings with minimal U.S. income tax consequences other than the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. Since most of our cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries which are disregarded entities for domestic tax purposes, any repatriation of such funds to the U.S. would likely have a nominal tax impact, if any.

43

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third-party obligations during the periods presented. An “off-balance sheet arrangement” generally entails a transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us, is a party under which we have any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest or a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at March 31, 2019 and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

 Maturities of Payments Due (in $000’s)
------------------------------- -------------------------------------- ------ ---------------- ----- --------- --------- ----------------- ----- -----
 Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years

[Part I, Item 1]:
ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, India, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. In August 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million. The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The results of RB Foods' operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition. Business Segments We operate in two business segments, consumer and flavor solutions. Demand for flavor is growing globally, and across both segments we have the customer base and product breadth to participate in all types of eating occasions. Our products deliver flavor when cooking at home, dining out, purchasing a quick service meal or enjoying a snack. We o...

Income Taxes

Our provision for income taxes is composed of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years as the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to impact taxable income.

We regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. We consider whether a valuation allowance is needed on our deferred tax assets by evaluating all positive and negative evidence relative to our ability to recover deferred tax assets, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results.

We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit at the largest amount that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis, when applicable. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, new information and technical insights, and changes in tax laws. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. When applicable, we accrue for the effects of uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest through income tax expense.

Effective April 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, recognition of stock compensation award forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, the calculation of diluted shares outstanding and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The effects of this impact will be hard to predict and variable moving forward as such effects are dependent upon actual stock option exercises.

(1) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of NES and Neff in April 2017 and October 2017, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of NES and Neff. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 does not include BakerCorp and BlueLine because we had not acquired them as of December 31, 2017. If the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine were included for the year ended December 31, 2017, estimated market share as of December 31, 2017 would have been 12.9 percent. Strategy 2  For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2019, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------...
