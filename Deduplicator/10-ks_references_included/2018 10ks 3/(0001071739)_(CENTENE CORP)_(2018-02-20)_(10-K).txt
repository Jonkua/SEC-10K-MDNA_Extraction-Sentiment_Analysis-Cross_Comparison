ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A.“Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

General

We are a diversified, multi-national healthcare enterprise that provides services to government sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. We provide member-focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions.

Results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits (including estimated costs incurred) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs. We measure operating performance based upon two key ratios. The health benefits ratio (HBR) represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed, and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided. The SG&A expense ratio represents SG&A costs as a percentage of premium and service revenues, excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues that are separately billed.

In 2013, we classified the operations for Kentucky Spirit as discontinued operations for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements. Management's discussion and analysis, with the exception of cash flow information, is presented in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified.

Fidelis Care Transaction

In September 2017, we signed a definitive agreement under which New York State Catholic Health Plan, Inc., d/b/a Fidelis Care New York (Fidelis Care), will become our health plan in New York State upon closing. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire substantially all of the assets of Fidelis Care for $3.75 billion, subject to certain adjustments. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to various closing conditions and receipt of New York regulatory approvals, including approvals under the New York Not-for-Profit Corporation Law. In October 2017, we announced the early termination of the waiting period required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Subject to market conditions, we expect to fund the transaction with approximately $2.3 billion of new equity, including share consideration, and approximately $1.6 billion of new long-term debt.

Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties

In October 2017, the President signed an executive order allowing trade associations and other groups to establish health plans exempt from certain ACA requirements, which may be sold across state lines. Also, in October 2017, the Trump Administration announced that the federal government would stop funding cost sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies. Additionally, a deal was subsequently reached by bipartisan Senators to restore CSR payments for two years in exchange for more ACA state flexibility. There are no guarantees the deal will reach the Senate floor for vote. The lack of CSR payments from the Federal Government for the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted in expense of $0.08 per diluted share included in our 2017 earnings. The limited impact is the result of payments received through September 30, 2017 in our various states being nearly sufficient to cover our full year CSR expectations. For 2018, all of our states have approved premium rates that assumed no CSR funding. Despite the removal of the CSRs, individuals below 400% of the federal poverty level (our target market) will still have access to subsidies through the Advance Premium Tax Credit (APTC). We continue to believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Income Tax Reform) was signed into law by the President. The modified tax code includes a lower corporate tax rate and changes to certain credits and deductions, including the limitations to the deductibility of interest expense. The enactment of Income Tax Reform resulted in a benefit of $0.71 per diluted share to our 2017 earnings related to the adjustment of the income tax rate on our net deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the Income Tax Reform bill repealed the individual mandate requirement of the ACA beginning in 2019.

2017 Highlights

Our financial performance for 2017 is summarized as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Year-end managed care membership of 12.2 million, an increase of 765,300 members, or 7% over 2016.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total revenues of $48.4 billion, representing 19% growth year-over-year.

- --------------------------------------------------

On March 24, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Health Net, a publicly traded managed care organization that delivers healthcare services through health plans and government-sponsored managed care plans. Due to the size of this acquisition, one of the primary drivers of the year-over-year variances discussed throughout this section is related to the acquisition of Health Net.

A reconciliation from GAAP diluted EPS to Adjusted Diluted EPS is highlighted below, and additional detail is provided above under the heading "Non-GAAP Financial Presentation":

The following items contributed to our revenue and membership growth:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Arizona. In January 2017, we continued our participation as a qualified health plan issuer in the Arizona Health Insurance Marketplace and exited the Health Net preferred provider organization offerings in Arizona.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Centurion. In April 2016, Centurion began providing correctional healthcare services for the Florida Department of Corrections in three regions. In June 2016, Centurion began operating under two new contracts with the State of New Mexico Corrections Department to provide correctional medical healthcare services and pharmacy services. In June 2017, Centurion began operating under an expanded contract to provide correctional healthcare services for the Florida Department of Corrections in South Florida, expanding our services statewide.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Health Net. On March 24, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Health Net for approximately $6.0 billion, including the assumption of debt. This strategic acquisition broadened our service offerings, providing expansion in both Medicaid and Medicare programs. This acquisition provided further diversification across our markets and products through the addition of commercial products and government-sponsored care under federal contracts with the Department of Defense (DoD) and the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA), as well as Medicare Advantage. Health Net's operations are primarily concentrated in the states of California, Arizona, Oregon, and Washington.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Louisiana. In July 2016, Louisiana Healthcare Connections began serving Medicaid expansion members.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maryland. In July 2017, our specialty solutions subsidiary, Envolve, Inc., began providing health plan management services for Medicaid operations in Maryland.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Nebraska. In January 2017, our Nebraska subsidiary, Nebraska Total Care, began operating under a contract with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Medicaid and Long-Term Care as one of three managed care organizations to administer its new Heritage Health Program for Medicaid, ABD, CHIP, Foster Care and LTSS enrollees.

• Washington. In April 2016, our Washington subsidiary, Coordinated Care of Washington, began operating as the sole contractor with the Washington State Health Care Authority to provide foster care services through the Apple Health Foster Care contract.

The growth items listed above are partially offset by the following items:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In Georgia and Indiana, we were recently successful in reprocuring contracts. However, the Medicaid programs were expanded to include additional insurers, which has reduced our market share. In addition, we are no longer serving LTSS members in Arizona.

We expect the following items to contribute to our revenue or future growth potential:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We expect to realize the full year benefit in 2018 of business commenced during 2017 in Florida, Maryland, Missouri and Nevada, as discussed above.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In February 2018, our Arkansas subsidiary, Arkansas Total Care began managing a Medicaid special needs population comprised of people with high behavioral health needs and individuals with developmental/intellectual disabilities. Arkansas Total Care will assume full-risk on this population beginning in January 2019.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In January 2018, our New Mexico subsidiary, Western Sky Community Care, was awarded a statewide contract in New Mexico for the Centennial Care 2.0 Program. The new contract is expected to commence membership operations in January 2019.

In October 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published updated Medicare Star quality ratings for the 2018 ratings year. The 2018 ratings year will affect quality bonus payments for Medicare Advantage plans in 2019. The results indicate that one of Health Net of California, Inc.'s Medicare Advantage plans (H0562) will move to a 3.5 Star rating from a 4.0 Star rating for the 2018 ratings year. The effect of this Star rating change would lower our parent Star rating for the 2018 ratings year from 4.0 Stars to 3.5 Stars. The reduction in the Star rating for Health Net California is the result of a 2015 program audit. Health Net California's underlying rating reflects 4.0 Star performance; however, CMS lowered a single measure (BAPP – Beneficiary Access and Performance Problem) because of a penalty associated with a plan audit in 2015, which caused a decline in the overall score to 3.5 Stars. While overall quality measures improved on a year-over-year basis, such improvement was insufficient to compensate for the lower BAPP measure. The penalty related to the 2015 program audit will only impact the 2018 ratings year and will not have a continuing impact on the Star ratings in future rating years. We are currently appealing. Our commitment to quality remains as strong as ever. We are working to evaluate and mitigate the potential impact on our revenues in 2019 as a result of the lowered 2018 rating and working to implement year-over-year quality improvements. We believe we will return to a 4.0 Star parent rating in future periods.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased 19% in the year ended December 31, 2017, over the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of Health Net's results, as well as the impact of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017. This was partially offset by the moratorium of the health insurer fee in 2017, lower membership in the commercial business in California as a result of margin improvement actions taken in 2016, and lower specialty pharmacy revenues. As a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee revenue in 2017, compared to $531 million recognized in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received Medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded an approximate net 1% composite change across all of our markets.

Operating Expenses

Medical Costs

Results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately estimate costs incurred. The HBR represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues (excluding premium tax and health insurer fee revenues) and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided.

The HBR for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 87.3%, an increase of 80 basis points over the comparable period in 2016. The increase compared to last year was primarily a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum MLR change in California, which reduced the 2016 HBR by 50 basis points, a premium rate reduction for California Medicaid Expansion effective July 1, 2017, an increase in flu related costs over 2016, and the impact of new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR. These increases were partially offset by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, which operates at a lower HBR.

Cost of Services

Cost of services decreased by $17 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This was primarily due to lower specialty pharmacy sales and decreased costs associated with our federal services business, partially offset by growth in our correctional business. The cost of service ratio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 81.5%, compared to 85.5% in 2016. The decrease in the cost of service ratio is primarily due to decreased costs associated with our federal services business and the results of the shared savings programs in our home-based primary care business.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A increased by $770 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This was primarily a result of:

- -----------------------------------------------------------
• a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• the impact of new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017;

- --------------------------------
• higher business expansion costs;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• additional expense recognized for our estimated share of the undiscounted guaranty association assessment resulting from the liquidation of Penn Treaty; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher variable compensation expenses based on the performance of the business in 2017.

The increases above are partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related expenses of $214 million.

The SG&A expense ratio was 9.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in the SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to lower acquisition related expenses, partially offset by higher business expansion costs over 2016, the Penn Treaty assessment and our results including a full year of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business.

The Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was primarily attributable to higher business expansion costs over 2016 and a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a greater mix of commercial and Medicare business.

Health Insurer Fee Expense

As a result of the health insurer fee moratorium, which suspended the health insurance provider fee for the 2017 calendar year, we did not recognize health insurer fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $461 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Other Income (Expense)

The following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):

--------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- ---- - ---- -

 2017 2016
Investment income $ 187 $ 109
Earnings from equity method investments 3 5
Interest expense (255 ) (217 )
Other income (expense), net $ (65 ) $ (103 )

The increase in investment income in 2017 reflects higher interest rates and investment balances over 2016, as well as interest income from the State of Illinois related to capitation payment delays. Interest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 by $38 million due to an increase in net borrowings, primarily related to the issuance of an additional $2.4 billion in Senior Notes in February 2016 in connection with the financing of the Health Net transaction.

Income Tax Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $326 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.1 billion, or an effective tax rate of 28.7%. The effective tax rate reflects the effect of Income Tax Reform and the health insurer fee moratorium. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded lower income tax expense of $125 million related to the provisional effect of the income tax rate reduction, primarily represented as a reduction to our deferred income tax liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $599 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion, or an effective tax rate of 51.8%, which reflects the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee expense as well as the non-deductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the closing of our acquisition of Health Net.

In January 2017, we reclassified Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona, LLC and the related Cenpatico Integrated Care health plan from the Specialty Services segment to the Managed Care segment due to a reorganization of the Arizona management structure following the Health Net integration. As a result, the financial results of Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona, LLC and the related Cenpatico Integrated Care health plan have been reclassified from the Specialty Services segment to the Managed Care segment for all periods presented.

Table of Contents

Managed Care

Total revenues increased 19% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, primarily as a result of a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results and growth, expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas, partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium. Earnings from operations decreased $160 million between years primarily as a result of the $195 million of revenue recognized in 2016 relating to the minimum MLR change in California, the health insurer fee moratorium in 2017, and new or expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR and incur start-up costs. These drivers were partially offset by $214 million of lower acquisition related expenses and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business.

Specialty Services

Total revenues increased 44% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the corresponding period in 2016, resulting primarily from the a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results, the continued integration of Health Net into our specialty services, increased services associated with membership growth in the Managed Care segment, and growth in our correctional services and home-based primary care businesses. Earnings from operations increased $99 million between years primarily due to a full year of the Health Net business in our 2017 results.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015

Total Revenues

Total revenues increased 78% in the year ended December 31, 2016, over the corresponding period in 2015, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Health Net, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, and the impact from expansions, acquisitions or new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received Medicaid premium rate adjustments which yielded a net 1% composite rate change across all of our markets.

Operating Expenses

Medical Costs

The HBR for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 86.5%, a decrease of 240 basis points over the comparable period in 2015. The decrease compared to last year is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Health Net, membership growth in Medicaid Expansion and Health Insurance Marketplace products, and improvement in HBR in the higher acuity populations. Also, in the fourth quarter, we recognized additional revenue relating to the retroactive contract amendment that changed the minimum MLR calculation under California's Medicaid expansion program, which reduced our 2016 HBR by 50 basis points.

Cost of Services

Cost of services increased by $243 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Health Net and growth in our correctional business, partially offset by lower pharmacy costs to external customers. The cost of service ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 85.5%, compared to 86.4% in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to the acquisition of Health Net, which operates at a lower cost of service ratio.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A increased by $1.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the corresponding period in 2015. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Health Net, acquisition related expenses, restructuring and integration costs, and the impact from expansions, acquisitions, or new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded approximately $234 million of Health Net acquisition related expenses, which reduced our diluted earnings per share by $0.98. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded approximately $27 million of Health Net acquisition related expenses, which reduced our diluted earnings per share by $0.14. We also recorded expense of $50 million in 2016 for contribution commitments to our charitable foundation.

The SG&A expense ratio was 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 8.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the SG&A expense ratio is primarily attributable to the addition of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio due to a higher mix of commercial and Medicare business.

Other Income (Expense)

The following table summarizes the components of other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, ($ in millions):

Investment income $ 109 $ 27
Earnings from equity method investments 5 8
Interest expense (217 ) (43 )
Other income (expense), net $ (103 ) $ (8 )

The increase in investment income in 2016 reflects an increase in investment balances over 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of Health Net. Interest expense increased during the year ended December 31, 2016 by $174 million primarily reflecting the issuance of an additional $2,400 million in Senior Notes in February 2016 in connection with the financing of the Health Net transaction. Interest expense also increased due to the issuance of an additional $500 million in Senior Notes in June 2016, the assumption of Health Net's $400 million in Senior Notes, and the issuance of the $1,200 million in Senior Notes in November 2016. These increases were partially offset by the redemption of the Centene $425 million 5.75% Senior Notes and the Health Net $400 million 6.375% Senior Notes in November 2016 and December 2016, respectively. In addition, we incurred $11 million associated with the early redemption of the Centene 5.75% Senior Notes due 2017 and the Health Net 6.375% Senior Notes due 2017, which was recorded in interest expense.

Income Tax Expense

For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded income tax expense of $599 million on pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion, or an effective tax rate of 51.8%. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded income tax expense of $339 million on pre-tax earnings of $697 million, or an effective tax rate of 48.6%. The effective tax rate is higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily as a result of the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee expense, limitations on the deductibility of compensation, and the non-deductibility of certain acquisition related costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Health Net.

Segment Results

As previously discussed, Cenpatico Behavioral Health of Arizona, LLC and the related Cenpatico Integrated Care health plan were reclassified to the Managed Care segment in January 2017.

Managed Care

Total revenues increased 83% in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Health Net and expansions or new programs in many of our states, particularly California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon, Texas, and Washington. Earnings from operations increased $546 million between years primarily reflecting the acquisition of Health Net and product and geographical expansions in many of our states.

Specialty Services

Total revenues increased 24% in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, resulting primarily from the acquisition of Health Net, growth in our behavioral health and correctional services businesses, and increased services associated with membership growth in the Managed Care segment. Earnings from operations increased $9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in earnings related to our pharmacy benefits management and correctional services businesses and the Health Net acquisition, partially offset by lower earnings in our specialty pharmacy and home-based primary care businesses, as well as increased utilization in several specialty services businesses.

Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents — (1 ) —
Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 142 $ 2,170 $ 150

Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities

Normal operations are funded primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2017 were $1.5 billion, or 1.8 times net earnings, compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. The cash provided by operations in 2017 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and the commencement of the Nebraska and Nevada health plans.

Cash flows from operating activities for 2016 was $1.9 billion, compared to $658 million in 2015. Cash provided by operations in 2016 was primarily due to net earnings, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and medical claims liabilities, and a decrease in other assets and premium and trade receivables. Additionally, cash provided by operations in 2016 was increased by approximately $445 million due to the timing of cash receipts shortly following the acquisition date. The cash provided by operations in 2015 was primarily related to net earnings and an increase in medical claims liabilities resulting from growth in the business, partially offset by increases in premium and trade receivables.

Cash flows from operations in each year were impacted by the timing of payments we received from our states. States may prepay the following month premium payment, which we record as unearned revenue, or they may delay our premium payment, which we record as a receivable. We typically receive capitation payments monthly; however, the states in which we operate may decide to adjust their payment schedules which could positively or negatively impact our reported cash flows from operating activities in any given period.

Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities

Investing activities used cash of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, $2.4 billion in 2016, and $813 million in 2015. Cash flows used in investing activities in 2017 primarily consisted of net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures.

We spent $422 million and $306 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on capital expenditures for system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions.

As of December 31, 2017, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed-income securities with a weighted average duration of 3.3 years. We had unregulated cash and investments of $310 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $264 million at December 31, 2016. Unregulated cash and investments include equity method investments and company owned life insurance contracts.

Table of Contents

Cash flows used in investing activities in 2016 primarily consisted of our acquisition of Health Net, net additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments, and capital expenditures. In March 2016, we acquired Health Net for approximately $5,990 million, including the assumption of $703 million of debt. The total consideration for the acquisition was $5,287 million, consisting of Centene common shares valued at $3,038 million, $2,247 million in cash, and $2 million related to the fair value adjustment to stock based compensation associated with pre-combination service.

Cash flows used in investing activities in 2015 primarily consisted of additions to the investment portfolio of our regulated subsidiaries, including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long-term investments and capital expenditures.

Cash Flows (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities

Our financing activities used cash of $82 million in 2017, compared to providing cash of $2.7 billion and $305 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Financing activities in 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed below.

2017

During 2017, our net financing activities primarily related to common stock repurchases resulting from stock relinquished to us by employees for payment of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock units and the purchase of noncontrolling interest, partially offset by increased borrowings on our revolving credit agreement. In December 2017, we amended and increased our $1,000 million unsecured revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) to $1,500 million.

2016

During 2016, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes in February 2016 associated with the Health Net acquisition, the issuance of additional Senior Notes in June 2016 and November 2016, partially offset by the redemption of our 5.75% Senior Notes due 2017, the redemption of our 6.375% Senior Notes due 2017, and the repayment of amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.

In February 2016, our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary (Escrow Issuer) issued $1,400 million of 5.625% Senior Notes ($1,400 Million Notes) at par due 2021 and $1,000 million of 6.125% Senior Notes ($1,000 Million Notes) at par due 2024. We used the net proceeds of the offering, together with borrowings under the our new $1,000 million revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the cash consideration for the Health Net acquisition and to pay acquisition and offering related fees and expenses. In connection with the February 2016 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for notional amounts of $600 million and $1,000 million, at floating rates of interest based on the three month LIBOR plus 4.22% and the three month LIBOR plus 4.44%, respectively. Gains and losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and are recorded as an adjustment to the $1,400 Million Notes and $1,000 Million Notes.

In connection with the closing of the Health Net acquisition on March 24, 2016, our then-existing unsecured $500 million revolving credit facility was terminated and simultaneously replaced with the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon LIBOR rates, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate.

In June 2016, we issued an additional $500 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2022 at a premium to yield 4.41% ($500 Million Add-on Notes). The $500 Million Add-on Notes were offered as additional debt securities under the indenture governing the $500 million of 4.75% Senior Notes issued April 2014. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and to pay offering related fees and expenses.

In November 2016, we issued $1,200 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2025 ($1,200 Million Notes). We used the net proceeds to redeem our $425 million of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2017 and Health Net's $400 million of 6.375% Senior Notes due 2017, to repay amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, to pay related fees and expenses and for general purposes.

Table of Contents

2015

During 2015, our financing activities primarily related to the proceeds from the issuance of Senior Debt and an additional $150 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. In January 2015, we issued an additional $200 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due May 15, 2022 at par (Add on Notes). In connection with the January 2015 issuance, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $200 million (2015 Swap Agreements) that are scheduled to expire on May 15, 2022. Under the 2015 Swap Agreements, we receive a fixed rate of 4.75% and pay a variable rate of LIBOR plus a spread adjusted quarterly, which allows us to adjust the $200 million Notes to a floating rate. We do not hold or issue any derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes.

Liquidity Metrics

In December 2017, we amended and increased our $1,000 million revolving credit facility to $1,500 million. The agreement has a maturity date of December 14, 2022. Borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon LIBOR rates, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate. The credit agreement underlying our Revolving Credit Facility contains non-financial and financial covenants, including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratios. We are required to not exceed a maximum debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2017, we had $150 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and we were in compliance with all covenants. As of December 31, 2017, there were no limitations on the availability under the revolving credit agreement as a result of the debt-to-EBITDA ratio.

We had outstanding letters of credit of $77 million as of December 31, 2017, which were not part of our revolving credit facility. We also had letters of credit for $45 million (valued at the December 31, 2017 conversion rate), or €38 million, representing our proportional share of the letters of credit issued to support Ribera Salud's outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility. Collectively, the letters of credit bore weighted interest of 1.31% as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $404 million as of December 31, 2017.

The indentures governing our various maturities of senior notes contain non-financial and financial covenants of Centene Corporation, including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.

In October 2017, we executed a $200 million non-recourse construction loan to fund the expansion of our corporate headquarters. The loan bears interest based on the one month LIBOR plus 2.70% and matures in April 2021 with an optional one-year extension. The agreement contains financial and non-financial covenants aligning with our revolving credit agreement. We have guaranteed completion of the construction project associated with the loan. As of December 31, 2017, we had no borrowing outstanding under the loan. We expect to begin drawing on the construction loan in 2018.

In February 2017 and in connection with the November 2016 issuance of $1,200 Million Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $600 million, at floating rates of interest based on the one month LIBOR plus 2.53%. Gains and losses due to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and are recorded as an adjustment to the $1,200 Million Notes.

At December 31, 2017, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of a negative $629 million, compared to a negative $258 million at December 31, 2016. We manage our short-term and long-term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short-term requirements as needed.

At December 31, 2017, our debt to capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 40.6%, compared to 44.1% at December 31, 2016. Excluding the $61 million non-recourse mortgage note, our debt to capital ratio was 40.3% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 43.7% at December 31, 2016. We utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.

We have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 8 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We have 3 million available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of December 31, 2017. No duration has been placed on the repurchase program. We reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. We did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2017, 2016 or 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we received dividends of $312 million, $121 million, and $11 million, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.

2018 Expectations

In the second quarter of 2018, we expect to complete the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition, for approximately $3.75 billion. In connection with the upcoming closing of the acquisition, we expect to issue approximately $2.3 billion of new equity and approximately $1.6 billion of new debt. The proceeds of the debt issuance will be held in escrow until the closing of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition.

During 2018, we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $325 million associated with our growth and spend approximately $706 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions. These amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation and borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. However, from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes, either through issuance of debt or equity, the sale of investment securities or otherwise, as appropriate. Also, we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities and/or improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us.

Based on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes future contractual obligations. These obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances. Our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes, Revolving Credit Facility, mortgages and capital leases. The purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts. The contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows ($ in millions):

------------------------------- ---------------------- ------ --------------- --- -------- ----- -------- ---------------- ----- ----- ----- - -----

(1) Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017, includes $952 million of other long-term liabilities. This consists primarily of long-term deferred income taxes, liabilities under our deferred compensation plan, reserves for uncertain tax positions and retirement benefit obligations. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain.

Commitments

In addition, in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of the Health Net acquisition from the California Department of Insurance and the California Department of Managed Health Care, we committed to certain undertakings (the Undertakings). The Undertakings included, among other items, operational commitments around premiums, dividend restrictions, minimum Risk Based Capital (RBC) levels, local offices, growth, accreditation, HEDIS scores and other quality measures, network adequacy, certifications, investments and capital expenditures. Specifically, we agreed to, among other things:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• invest an additional $30 million through the California Organized Investment Network over the five years following completion of the acquisition;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• build a service center in an economically distressed community in California, investing $200 million over 10 years and employing at least 300 people;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• contribute $65 million to improve enrollee health outcomes ($10 million over five years), support locally-based consumer assistance programs ($5 million over five years) and strengthen the healthcare delivery system ($50 million over five years), of which the present value of $61 million was expensed in the year ended December 31, 2016 and classified as SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations; and

• invest $75 million of its investment portfolio in vehicles supporting California’s healthcare infrastructure.

The undertakings require significant investments by us, may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future obligations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies, and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms.

Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As managed care organizations, most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.

Our regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate. As of December 31, 2017, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $5,153 million, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of $2,251 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we contributed $26 million of net statutory capital to our subsidiaries. For our subsidiaries that file with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), we estimate our RBC percentage to be in excess of 350% of the Authorized Control Level.

Under the California Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, as amended (“Knox-Keene”), certain of our California subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity (TNE) requirements. Under these Knox-Keene TNE requirements, actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of (i) a fixed minimum amount, (ii) a minimum amount based on premiums or (iii) a minimum amount based on healthcare expenditures, excluding capitated amounts. In addition, certain of our California subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the DMHC to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates, to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities' TNE below the required amount as specified in the undertaking.

The NAIC has adopted rules which set minimum risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies, managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. As of December 31, 2017, each of our health plans was in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements enacted in those states.

As a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments, loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies. Such restrictions, unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted, limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations. The maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus, statutory income and unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was $2,251 million in the aggregate.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

For this information, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our accounting policies regarding intangible assets, medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets. These intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased contract rights, provider contracts, trade names and goodwill. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. At December 31, 2017, we had $4,749 million of goodwill and $1,398 million of other intangible assets.

Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the following periods:

------------------------- -------------------

Intangible Asset Amortization Period
Purchased contract rights 5 - 15 years
Provider contracts 4 - 15 years
Customer relationships 3 - 15 years
Trade names 7 - 20 years
Developed technologies 5 years

Our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. If the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired, the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset. Our management must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor, future utility and other internal and external factors, in determining the estimated fair values. While we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results.

Goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment. In addition, an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors. These factors include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks and contracts.

We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. However, in certain circumstances, such as recent acquisitions, we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors. The fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date.

Medical Claims Liability

Our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid, or inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, or IBNR, and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period. We estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. These actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors.

Actuarial Standards of Practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions. Moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate. In many situations, the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the Actuarial Standards of Practice. We include in our IBNR an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving.

58

Table of Contents

We use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates. The assumptions we consider when estimating IBNR include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims.

We apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated. For more recent periods, incurred non-inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors. Incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors. For older periods, we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop IBNR estimates. The completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs. When we commence operations in a new state or region, we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability. See “Risk Factors - Failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.” These approaches are consistently applied to each period presented.

Additionally, we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis. The independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability. We do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability. We utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information, together with management's judgment, to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims.

Our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available. As more complete claims information becomes available, we adjust the amount of the estimates, and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified. In every reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods. We consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period. As additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our actuarial models accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates.

The paid and received completion factors, claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the IBNR estimate. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on December 31, 2017 data:

While we believe our estimates are appropriate, it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates. For example, a 1% increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, excluding the effect of any return of premium, risk corridor, or minimum MLR programs. The estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources.

The change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows (in millions):

Days in claims payable (1) 41 42 44

(1) Days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year.

Medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider. As a result, the liability generally is described as having a “short-tail,” which causes less than 5% of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year. We believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of December 31, 2017 will be known by the end of 2018.

Changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions. Additionally, as a result of minimum HBR and other return of premium programs, approximately $1 million, $39 million and $47 million of the “Incurred related to: Prior years” was recorded as a reduction to premium revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Further, claims processing initiatives yielded increased claim payment recoveries and coordination of benefits related to prior year dates of service. Changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates. While we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis, medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim. Accordingly, any change in behavior, leveling of care, or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result, the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us. Additionally, certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member's acuity. In these cases, determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined. Because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the volume of claims that we process, we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of IBNR.

The following are examples of medical management initiatives that may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit hospital admissions, other inpatient hospital admissions, and observation admissions, in accordance with Interqual or other criteria.

• Increased emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patient's specific healthcare needs.

• Incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma.

• Prenatal and infant health programs utilized in our Start Smart For Your Baby outreach service.

Revenue Recognition

Our health plans generate revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans. We generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts and recognize premium revenues during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members at the amount reasonably estimable. In some instances, our base premiums are subject to an adjustment, or risk score, based on the acuity of its membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the State analyzing submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's Medicaid membership. We estimate the amount of risk adjustment based upon the processed claims data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis. Some contracts allow for additional premiums related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries.

Our contracts with states may require us to maintain a minimum HBR or may require us to share profits in excess of certain levels. In certain circumstances, our plans may be required to return premium to the state in the event profits exceed established levels. We estimate the effect of these programs and recognize reductions in revenue in the current period. Other states may require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive additional or full contractual revenue. For performance-based contracts, we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance.

Revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states, which is adjusted on a monthly basis by the states for retroactive additions or deletions to membership data. These eligibility adjustments are estimated monthly and subsequent adjustments are made in the period known. We continuously review and updates those estimates as new information becomes available. It is possible that new information could require us to make additional adjustments, which could be significant, to these estimates.

Our Medicare Advantage contracts are with CMS. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, physician treatment settings as well as prescription drug events. We and the healthcare providers collect, compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS and record revenues on a risk adjusted basis.

Our specialty services generate revenues under contracts with state and federal programs, healthcare organizations and other commercial organizations, as well as from our own subsidiaries. Revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services. We recognize revenue related to administrative services under the TRICARE government-sponsored managed care support contract on a straight-line basis over the option period, when the fees become fixed and determinable. The TRICARE contract includes various performance-based incentives and penalties. For each of the incentives or penalties, we adjust revenue accordingly based on the amount that it has earned or incurred at each interim date and are legally entitled to in the event of a contract termination.

Some states enact premium taxes, similar assessments and provider pass-through payments, collectively premium taxes, and these taxes are recorded as a separate component of both revenues and operating expenses. Additionally, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the Affordable Care Act annual HIF. If we are able to negotiate reimbursement of portions of these premium taxes or the HIF, we recognize revenue associated with the HIF on a straight-line basis when we have binding agreements for such reimbursements, including the “gross-up” to reflect the HIFs non-tax deductible nature. Collectively, this revenue is recorded as premium tax and health insurer fee revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fidelis Care Transaction

In September 2017, we signed a definitive agreement under which New York State Catholic Health Plan, Inc., d/b/a Fidelis Care New York (Fidelis Care), will become our health plan in New York State upon closing. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire substantially all of the assets of Fidelis Care for $3.75 billion, subject to certain adjustments. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to various closing conditions and receipt of New York regulatory approvals, including approvals under the New York Not-for-Profit Corporation Law. In October 2017, we announced the early termination of the waiting period required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. Subject to market conditions, we expect to fund the transaction with approximately $2.3 billion of new equity, including share consideration, and approximately $1.6 billion of new long-term debt.

Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties

In October 2017, the President signed an executive order allowing trade associations and other groups to establish health plans exempt from certain ACA requirements, which may be sold across state lines. Also, in October 2017, the Trump Administration announced that the federal government would stop funding cost sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies. Additionally, a deal was subsequently reached by bipartisan Senators to restore CSR payments for two years in exchange for more ACA state flexibility. There are no guarantees the deal will reach the Senate floor for vote. The lack of CSR payments from the Federal Government for the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted in expense of $0.08 per diluted share included in our 2017 earnings. The limited impact is the result of payments received through September 30, 2017 in our various states being nearly sufficient to cover our full year CSR expectations. For 2018, all of our states have approved premium rates that assumed no CSR funding. Despite the removal of the CSRs, individuals below 400% of the federal poverty level (our target market) will still have access to subsidies through the Advance Premium Tax Credit (APTC). We continue to believe we have both the capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Income Tax Reform) was signed into law by the President. The modified tax code includes a lower corporate tax rate and changes to certain credits and deductions, including the limitations to the deductibility of interest expense. The enactment of Income Tax Reform resulted in a benefit of $0.71 per diluted share to our 2017 earnings related to the adjustment of the income tax rate on our net deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the Income Tax Reform bill repealed the individual mandate requirement of the ACA beginning in 2019.

['s outstanding debt which are a part of the revolving credit facility. Collectively, the letters of credit bore weighted interest of 1.31% as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we had outstanding surety bonds of $404 million as of December 31, 2017.

The indentures governing our various maturities of senior notes contain non-financial and financial covenants of Centene Corporation, including requirements of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants.

In October 2017, we executed a $200 million non-recourse construction loan to fund the expansion of our corporate headquarters. The loan bears interest based on the one month LIBOR plus 2.70% and matures in April 2021 with an optional one-year extension. The agreement contains financial and non-financial covenants aligning with our revolving credit agreement. We have guaranteed completion of the construction project associated with the loan. As of December 31, 2017, we had no borrowing outstanding under the loan. We expect to begin drawing on the construction loan in 2018.

In February 2017 and in connection with the November 2016 issuance of $1,200 Million Notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of $600 million, at floating rates of interest based on the one month LIBOR plus 2.53%. Gains and losses due to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps completely offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt and are recorded as an adjustment to the $1,200 Million Notes.

At December 31, 2017, we had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of a negative $629 million, compared to a negative $258 million at December 31, 2016. We manage our short-term and long-term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short-term requirements as needed.

At December 31, 2017, our debt to capital ratio, defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and total equity, was 40.6%, compared to 44.1% at December 31, 2016. Excluding the $61 million non-recourse mortgage note, our debt to capital ratio was 40.3% as of December 31, 2017, compared to 43.7% at December 31, 2016. We utilize the debt to capital ratio as a measure, among others, of our leverage and financial flexibility.

We have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to 8 million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. We have 3 million available shares remaining under the program for repurchases as of December 31, 2017. No duration has been placed on the repurchase program. We reserve the right to discontinue the repurchase program at any time. We did not make any repurchases under this plan during 2017, 2016 or 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we received dividends of $312 million, $121 million, and $11 million, respectively, from our regulated subsidiaries.

2018 Expectations

In the second quarter of 2018, we expect to complete the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition, for approximately $3.75 billion. In connection with the upcoming closing of the acquisition, we expect to issue approximately $2.3 billion of new equity and approximately $1.6 billion of new debt. The proceeds of the debt issuance will be held in escrow until the closing of the Proposed Fidelis Acquisition.

During 2018, we expect to make net capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries of approximately $325 million associated with our growth and spend approximately $706 million in additional capital expenditures primarily associated with system enhancements and market and corporate headquarters expansions. These amounts are expected to be funded by unregulated cash flow generation and borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. However, from time to time we may elect to raise additional funds for these and other purposes, either through issuance of debt or equity, the sale of investment securities or otherwise, as appropriate. Also, we may strategically pursue refinancing opportunities to extend maturities and/or improve terms of our indebtedness if we believe such opportunities are favorable to us.

Based on our operating plan, we expect that our available cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our general operations and capital expenditures for at least 12 months from the date of this filing.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes future contractual obligations. These obligations contain estimates and are subject to revision under a number of circumstances. Our debt consists of borrowings from our senior notes, Revolving Credit Facility, mortgages and capital leases. The purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchases and maintenance contracts. The contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows ($ in millions):

------------------------------- ---------------------- ------ --------------- --- -------- ----- -------- ---------------- ----- ----- ----- - -----

 Payments Due by Period
 Total Less Than1 Year 1-3Years 3-5Years More Than5 Years
Medical claims liability $ 4,286 $ 4,286 $ — $ — $ —

Other long-term liabilities (1) — — — — —
Total $ 11,542 $ 4,879 $ 900 $ 3,177 $ 2,586

(1) Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017, includes $952 million of other long-term liabilities. This consists primarily of long-term deferred income taxes, liabilities under our deferred compensation plan, reserves for uncertain tax positions and retirement benefit obligations. These liabilities have been excluded from the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain.

Commitments

In addition, in connection with obtaining regulatory approval of the Health Net acquisition from the California Department of Insurance and the California Department of Managed Health Care, we committed to certain undertakings (the Undertakings). The Undertakings included, among other items, operational commitments around premiums, dividend restrictions, minimum Risk Based Capital (RBC) levels, local offices, growth, accreditation, HEDIS scores and other quality measures, network adequacy, certifications, investments and capital expenditures. Specifically, we agreed to, among other things:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• invest an additional $30 million through the California Organized Investment Network over the five years following completion of the acquisition;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• build a service center in an economically distressed community in California, investing $200 million over 10 years and employing at least 300 people;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• contribute $65 million to improve enrollee health outcomes ($10 million over five years), support locally-based consumer assistance programs ($5 million over five years) and strengthen the healthcare delivery system ($50 million over five years), of which the present value of $61 million was expensed in the year ended December 31, 2016 and classified as SG&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• invest $75 million of its investment portfolio in vehicles supporting California’s healthcare infrastructure.

The undertakings require significant investments by us, may restrict or impose additional material costs on our future obligations and strategic initiatives in certain geographies, and subject us to various enforcement mechanisms.

REGULATORY CAPITAL AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As managed care organizations, most of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations and other requirements that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by each state, and restrict the timing, payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us. Generally, the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus.

Our regulated subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate. As of December 31, 2017, our subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $5,153 million, compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of $2,251 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we contributed $26 million of net statutory capital to our subsidiaries. For our subsidiaries that file with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), we estimate our RBC percentage to be in excess of 350% of the Authorized Control Level.

Under the California Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, as amended (“Knox-Keene”), certain of our California subsidiaries must comply with tangible net equity (TNE) requirements. Under these Knox-Keene TNE requirements, actual net worth less unsecured receivables and intangible assets must be more than the greater of (i) a fixed minimum amount, (ii) a minimum amount based on premiums or (iii) a minimum amount based on healthcare expenditures, excluding capitated amounts. In addition, certain of our California subsidiaries have made certain undertakings to the DMHC to restrict dividends and loans to affiliates, to the extent that the payment of such would reduce such entities']:

[' TNE below the required amount as specified in the undertaking.

The NAIC has adopted rules which set minimum risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies, managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage. As of December 31, 2017, each of our health plans was in compliance with the risk-based capital requirements enacted in those states.

As a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments, loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies. Such restrictions, unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted, limit the use of any cash generated by these subsidiaries to pay our obligations. The maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus, statutory income and unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of capital and surplus or net worth that was unavailable for the payment of dividends or return of capital to us was $2,251 million in the aggregate.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

For this information, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein. Our accounting policies regarding intangible assets, medical claims liability and revenue recognition are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

We have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets. These intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased contract rights, provider contracts, trade names and goodwill. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is generally attributable to the value of the synergies between the combined companies and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. At December 31, 2017, we had $4,749 million of goodwill and $1,398 million of other intangible assets.

Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the following periods:

------------------------- -------------------

Intangible Asset Amortization Period
Purchased contract rights 5 - 15 years
Provider contracts 4 - 15 years
Customer relationships 3 - 15 years
Trade names 7 - 20 years
Developed technologies 5 years

Our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. If the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired, the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset. Our management must make assumptions and estimates, such as the discount factor, future utility and other internal and external factors, in determining the estimated fair values. While we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results.

Goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment. In addition, an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors. These factors include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks and contracts.

We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We generally do not calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. However, in certain circumstances, such as recent acquisitions, we may elect to perform a quantitative assessment without first assessing qualitative factors. The fair value of all reporting units with material amounts of goodwill was substantially in excess of the carrying value as of our annual impairment testing date.

Medical Claims Liability

Our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid, or inventory, estimates for claims incurred but not reported, or IBNR, and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period. We estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. These actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors.

Actuarial Standards of Practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions. Moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate. In many situations, the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the Actuarial Standards of Practice. We include in our IBNR an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving.

Table of Contents

We use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates. The assumptions we consider when estimating IBNR include, without limitation, claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, healthcare service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims.

We apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated. For more recent periods, incurred non-inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors. Incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors. For older periods, we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop IBNR estimates. The completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs. When we commence operations in a new state or region, we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability. See “Risk Factors - Failure to accurately estimate and price our medical expenses or effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.” These approaches are consistently applied to each period presented.

Additionally, we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis. The independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability. We do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability. We utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information, together with management']:
