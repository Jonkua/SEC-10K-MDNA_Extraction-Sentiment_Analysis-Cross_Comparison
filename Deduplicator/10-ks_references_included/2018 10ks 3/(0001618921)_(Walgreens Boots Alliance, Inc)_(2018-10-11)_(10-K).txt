Item 7.  Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Company’s business and reportable segments in item 1 above. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements below and in risk factors in part I, item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor Walgreen Co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.

INTRODUCTION
Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (“Walgreens Boots Alliance”) and its subsidiaries are a global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments:

- --------------------
• Retail Pharmacy USA;

- ----------------------------------
• Retail Pharmacy International; and

- ------------------------
• Pharmaceutical Wholesale

See note 16, segment reporting, for further information.

Acquisition of certain Rite Aid Corporation (“Rite Aid”) assets
On September 19, 2017, the Company announced that it had secured regulatory clearance for an amended and restated asset purchase agreement to purchase 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for $4.375 billion in cash and other consideration. The Company has completed the acquisition of all 1,932 Rite Aid stores. The transition of the first distribution center and related inventory occurred in September 2018 and the transition of the remaining two distribution centers and related inventory remains subject to closing conditions set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement.

The Company continues to expect to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets by the end of fiscal 2020, at an estimated total cost of approximately $750 million, which is reported as acquisition-related costs. During fiscal 2018, the Company recognized pre-tax charges to its financial results of $221 million related to integration of the acquired stores and related assets. In addition, the Company continues to expect to spend approximately $500 million of capital on store conversions and related activities. The Company expects annual synergies from the transaction of more than $325 million, compared to the Company’s previously stated expectation of $300 million, which are expected to be fully realized within four years of the initial closing of this transaction and derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.

The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See “cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements” below.

Comparability
The influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms, strategic transactions including acquisitions, for example the acquisition of stores and other assets from Rite Aid, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations, changes in laws, for example the U.S. tax law changes, the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates and other factors on the Company’s operations and net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Premise Health
On June 28, 2018, Premise Health Holding Corp. and OMERS, a Canadian pension fund, announced that an affiliate of OMERS would acquire control of Premise Health, an entity in which the Company indirectly held a minority equity interest. In July 2018, the Company completed the sale of its minority equity interest in Premise Health, resulting in an after-tax gain on disposition of $245 million. The Company treated this transaction as a special item, which is reported as a gain on sale of equity method investment impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures for fiscal 2018.

Investment in Chinese Pharmacy Chain GuoDa

- 34 -

Table of Contents

On December 6, 2017 the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with China National Accord Medicines Corporation Ltd. to become an investor in its subsidiary Sinopharm Holding Guoda Drugstores Co., Ltd. (“GuoDa”), a leading retail pharmacy chain in China.

Following a public tender process, the Company’s bid met all the requirements set by the seller to acquire a 40 percent equity interest in GuoDa for approximately $416 million. On July 5, 2018, the Company acquired its 40 percent equity interest and began to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. See note 5, equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.

U.S. tax law changes
The United States government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in December 2017. The U.S. tax law changes include broad and complex changes affecting the Company's fiscal 2018 and future results. Among other things, the U.S. tax law changes reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and require companies to immediately accrue for a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over an eight year period. The U.S. tax law changes modify the taxation of foreign earnings, repeal the deduction for domestic production activities, limit interest deductibility and establish a global intangible low tax income (GILTI) regime.

In connection with the Company’s ongoing analysis of the impact of the U.S. tax law changes, which is provisional and subject to change, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of $125 million during fiscal 2018. This provisional net tax benefit arises from a benefit of $648 million from re-measuring the Company’s net U.S. deferred tax liabilities, partly offset by the Company’s accrual for the transition tax and other U.S. tax law changes of $523 million. As of August 31, 2018, while the Company made reasonable estimates of the impact of the U.S. tax law changes, the final impact may differ from these estimates, due to, among other things, changes in its interpretations and assumptions, technical clarifications from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS and actions the Company may take.

In addition, the Company’s results for fiscal 2018 also include a net reduction to the effective tax rate for the current year as a result of the U.S. tax law changes. The lower corporate income tax rate of 21% became effective January 1, 2018, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 26% for fiscal 2018 and 21% for subsequent fiscal years, which provided a benefit to the fiscal 2018 tax provision of approximately $307 million.

EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES
Store Optimization Program
On October 24, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a program (the “Store Optimization Program”) to optimize store locations through the planned closure of approximately 600 stores and related assets within the Company’s Retail Pharmacy USA segment upon completion of the acquisition of certain stores and related assets from Rite Aid. The actions under the Store Optimization Program commenced in March 2018 and are expected to take place over an 18 month period. The Store Optimization Program is expected to result in cost savings of approximately $325 million per year, compared to the Company’s previously stated expectation of $300 million, to be fully delivered by the end of fiscal 2020.

The Company currently estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $450 million, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate costs, employee severance and other exit costs. The Company expects to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $270 million for lease obligations and other real estate costs and approximately $180 million for employee severance and other exit costs. The Company estimates that substantially all of these cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures.

The Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") of $100 million, which were recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. These charges included $19 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs and $81 million in employee severance and other exit costs.

Store Optimization Program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company treats charges related to the Store Optimization Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures.

The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See “cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements” below.

Cost Transformation Program

- 35 -

Table of Contents

On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a restructuring program (the “Cost Transformation Program”) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program implemented and built on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by Walgreens on August 6, 2014 and included a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. In April 2015, the Company announced that it had identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increased the total expected cost savings of the Cost Transformation Program by $500 million to a targeted $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017, with significant areas of focus including plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focused primarily on the Company’s Retail Pharmacy USA segment. The Company achieved the targeted $1.5 billion in savings from the Cost Transformation Program ahead of schedule. As announced in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company closed a total of approximately 260 stores.

The Company completed the Cost Transformation Program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and over the duration of the program, 255 stores were closed. Full program benefits will be recognized in subsequent periods. The Company recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its fiscal 2017 financial results in accordance with GAAP of $1.8 billion. These charges included $743 million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; $665 million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); and $393 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. The Company estimates that approximately 60% of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures over time, primarily related to historical and future lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. See note 3, exit and disposal activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION RELATIONSHIP
In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the United States and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through WBAD. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.

In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergen’s Board of Directors in certain circumstances. Please refer to the Company’s Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements.

On March 18, 2016, the Company exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, the Company exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. As of August 31, 2018, the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 26% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. As of August 31, 2018, the Company can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.

Effective March 18, 2016, the Company began accounting for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to the investment being classified within the operating income of the Company’s Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. See note 5, equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, the Company’s results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to its investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2017 include approximately ten and a half months of equity income reflecting the Company’s increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.

WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
Fiscal 2018 net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance increased 23.2 percent to $5.0 billion, while diluted net earnings per share increased 33.6 percent to $5.05 compared with the prior year. The increases primarily reflect the Company’s Cost Transformation Program in prior year, operating performance and the gain on sale of the Company’s equity interest in Premise Health, partially offset by certain legal and regulatory accruals and an impairment of the Company’s equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation. Diluted net earnings per share was also positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year.

Other income for fiscal 2018 was $177 million compared to an expense of $11 million for fiscal 2017. Other income for fiscal 2018 includes the gain on sale of the Company’s equity interest Premise Health, partially offset by the impairment of the Company’s equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation.

Interest was a net expense of $616 million and $693 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Table of Contents

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 and 2017 was 16.7% and 15.7%, respectively. The net increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings, partly offset by a provisional net tax benefit of $125 million as a result of U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017. In addition, the Company’s results for fiscal 2018 also include a net reduction to the effective tax rate for the current year as a result of the U.S. tax law changes.

Adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2018 increased 8.8 percent to $6.0 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2018 increased 18.0 percent to $6.02 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were positively impacted by 0.8 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation.

Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2018 primarily reflect the impact of U.S. tax law changes and increased adjusted operating income. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was also positively affected by a lower number of shares outstanding compared with the prior year. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
Fiscal 2017 net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance decreased 2.3 percent to $4.1 billion, while diluted net earnings per share decreased 1.0 percent to $3.78 compared with the prior year. The decreases reflect Rite Aid related costs, the phasing of the Company’s Cost Transformation Program and the impact in the prior year of the change in accounting method for the Company’s investment in AmerisourceBergen, largely offset by the reduction in the fair value of the Company’s AmerisourceBergen warrants, improvements in selling, general and administration expenses before cost transformation expenses and a lower effective tax rate.

Other expense for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was $11 million and $261 million, respectively. In fiscal 2016, the change in fair value of the Company’s AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in a loss of $517 million, and additionally, the Company recognized income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for its investment in AmerisourceBergen.

Interest was a net expense of $693 million and $596 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase mainly reflects the prefunded acquisition financing costs relating to the Rite Aid transaction.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was 15.7% and 19.4%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings, favorable changes in permanent differences between the Company’s financial statement earnings and taxable profits as well as incremental discrete tax benefits. The mix of pre-tax earnings was notably impacted by the Cost Transformation Program and costs associated with the termination of the Rite Aid Merger Agreement, both of which reduced the Company’s U.S. pre-tax earnings. For fiscal 2017, net discrete tax benefits resulted primarily from deferred tax benefits related to a change in the U.K. tax rate, adopting ASU 2016-09 and net tax benefits associated with prior tax years.

Adjusted diluted net earnings per share (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance in fiscal 2017 increased 9.9 percent to $5.5 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2017 increased 11.1 percent to $5.10 compared with the prior year. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by 1.7 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points, respectively, as a result of currency translation.

Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen and a lower effective tax rate. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

4 Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or subject to a natural disaster in the past twelve months. Relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, the Company’s method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. The fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2016 results due to the leap year.

Sales fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
The Retail Pharmacy USA division’s sales for fiscal 2018 increased by 12.7% to $98.4 billion. Sales in comparable stores were up 1.5% in fiscal 2018. The Company operated 9,569 locations (9,560 retail stores) as of August 31, 2018, compared to 8,109 locations (8,100 retail stores) a year earlier.

Pharmacy sales increased by 17.2% in fiscal 2018 and represented 72.2% of the division’s sales. The increase in fiscal 2018 is due to higher prescription volumes, including central specialty and mail following the formation of AllianceRx Walgreens

Prime and from the acquisition of Rite Aid stores. This increase was partially offset by reimbursement pressure and the impact of generics. In fiscal 2017, pharmacy sales increased 7.3% and represented 69.4% of the division’s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 3.4% in fiscal 2018 compared to an increase of 4.7% in fiscal 2017. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.4% in fiscal 2018 compared to a reduction of 2.4% in fiscal 2017. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 0.9% in fiscal 2018 compared to a reduction of 1.5% for fiscal 2017. Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 98.3% of prescription sales for fiscal 2018 compared to 97.7% for fiscal 2017. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2018 was 823.1 million compared to 764.4 million in fiscal 2017. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,094.4 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 989.7 million in fiscal 2017. The increase in prescription volume was primarily driven by the acquisition of Rite Aid stores and from strategic pharmacy partnerships.

Retail sales increased 2.4% in fiscal 2018 and were 27.8% of the division’s sales. In comparison, fiscal 2017 retail sales decreased 2.4% and comprised 30.6% of the division’s sales. Comparable retail sales decreased 2.4% in fiscal 2018 compared to a decrease of 1.0% in fiscal 2017. The decrease in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, which were partially offset by growth in the health and wellness category and in the beauty category.

Operating income fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
Retail Pharmacy USA division’s operating income for fiscal 2018 increased 16.7% to $4.9 billion. The increase was primarily due to reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and higher sales, partially offset by lower gross margin.

Gross margin was 24.1% in fiscal 2018 compared to 25.7% in fiscal 2017. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by a higher mix of specialty sales and by lower third-party reimbursements. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies. Retail margins were positively impacted in the current fiscal year primarily due to underlying margin improvement from changes in promotional plans.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.2% in fiscal 2018 compared to 20.9% in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of sales, expenses were lower primarily due to sales mix in the current period and costs from the Cost Transformation Program in the year ago period, partially offset by certain legal and regulatory accruals in the current period.

Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017
Retail Pharmacy USA division’s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2018 increased 3.8% to $5.9 billion. The increase was primarily due to a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales and higher sales, partially offset by lower gross margin. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Sales fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
The Retail Pharmacy USA division’s sales for fiscal 2017 increased by 4.2% to $87.3 billion. Sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 2.8% in fiscal 2017 driven by growth in Medicare Part D prescriptions and strategic partnerships. Sales were also higher due to the inclusion of five months of results for AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, the Company’s recently formed central specialty and mail services business. The Company operated 8,109 locations (8,100 retail stores) as of August 31, 2017, compared to 8,184 locations (8,175 retail stores) a year earlier.

Pharmacy sales increased by 7.3% in fiscal 2017 and represented 69.4% of the division’s sales. The increase in fiscal 2017 is due to higher prescription volumes, including central specialty and mail following the formation of AllianceRx Walgreens Prime in March 2017. This increase was partially offset by the impact of generics and reimbursement pressure. In fiscal 2016, pharmacy sales increased 5.5% and represented 67.4% of the division’s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 4.7% in fiscal 2017 compared to an increase of 6.0% in fiscal 2016. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 2.4% in fiscal 2017 compared to a reduction of 1.9% in fiscal 2016. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.5% in fiscal 2017 compared to a reduction of 1.1% for fiscal 2016.

Retail sales decreased 2.4% in fiscal 2017 and were 30.6% of the division’s sales. In comparison, fiscal 2016 retail sales decreased 0.3% and comprised 32.6% of the division’s sales. Comparable retail sales decreased 1.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to a decrease of 0.3% in fiscal 2016. The decrease in comparable retail sales growth in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category, which were partially offset by growth in the health and wellness category and in the beauty category.

Operating income fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
Retail Pharmacy USA division’s operating income for fiscal 2017 decreased 4.8% to $4.2 billion. The decrease was primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Rite Aid transaction and the Cost Transformation Program, partially offset by an increase in gross profit.

Gross margin was 25.7% in fiscal 2017 compared to 26.6% in fiscal 2016. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements and a higher mix of specialty sales. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies. Retail margins were positively impacted in the current fiscal year primarily due to underlying margin improvement from actions taken the prior year, changes in promotional plans and sales mix.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 20.9% in fiscal 2017 compared to 21.4% in fiscal 2016. As a percentage of sales, expenses in the current fiscal year were lower primarily due to higher sales, sales mix and increased efficiencies from the Cost Transformation Program.

Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016
Retail Pharmacy USA division’s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2017 increased 6.5% to $5.7 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher pharmacy volume, lower selling, general and administrative expenses and improved retail margins. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

2 Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or a natural disaster in the past twelve months. Relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, the Company’s method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods. The fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 comparable sales figures include an adjustment to remove February 29, 2016 results due to the leap year.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash and cash equivalents were $0.8 billion (including $0.2 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2018, compared to $3.3 billion (including $1.8 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) at August 31, 2017. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds and AAA-rated money market funds.

The Company’s long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in its core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce those core strategies and meet return requirements and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company’s dividend policy to set forth the Company’s current intention to increase its dividend each year.

Cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.3 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $7.3 billion in fiscal 2017 and $7.8 billion in fiscal 2016. The $1.0 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities includes lower income taxes paid and lower cash outflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by higher cash outflows from trade accounts payable and other non-current liabilities. Changes in income taxes paid are mainly due to the impact of the U.S. tax law changes. Changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities, trade accounts payable and other non-current liabilities are mainly driven by the timing of accruals and payments including cash inflows post acquisition of Rite Aid assets in fiscal 2018 and cash inflows from term changes on pharmaceutical related purchases in fiscal 2017.

Net cash used for investing activities was $5.5 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $0.8 billion in fiscal 2017 and $3.5 billion in fiscal 2016. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2018 were $4.8 billion compared to $0.1 billion for the year-ago period. Business, investment and asset acquisitions in fiscal 2018 include the acquisition of Rite Aid assets and the investment in GuoDa. Fiscal 2016 included the acquisition of an international beauty brand and prescription files, as well as an investment in AmerisourceBergen of $2.4 billion as a result of the exercise of warrants.

Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2018 were $1.4 billion compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2017 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016. Capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows:

----------------------------- ---- ----- ---- --- ---- ----- --- - -----

Additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2018 did not include any proceeds related to sale leaseback transactions, compared to $444 million in the comparable prior year period.

Net cash used for financing activities in fiscal 2018 was $5.3 billion compared to net cash used for financing activities of $12.9 billion in fiscal 2017 and net cash provided by financing activities of $2.6 billion in fiscal 2016. The Company repurchased shares as part of the stock repurchase programs described below and to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $5.2 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $5.2 billion in fiscal 2017 and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2016. Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $174 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $217 million in fiscal 2017 and $235 million in fiscal 2016. Cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. In fiscal 2018 there were $5.9 billion in proceeds primarily from revolving facilities described below and commercial paper debt compared to no proceeds in 2017 and $6.0 billion in proceeds received from U.S. dollar denominated debt offerings in fiscal 2016 (a portion of which was redeemed in fiscal 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes, as described below).

The Company believes that cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and the ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for the Company’s foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. The Company’s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements.

See item 7A, qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk, below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.

Stock repurchase programs
In April 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a stock repurchase program (the “April 2017 stock repurchase program”), which authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the program’s expiration on December 31, 2017. In May 2017, the Company completed the April 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing 11.8 million shares. In June 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock prior to the program’s expiration on August 31, 2018, which authorization was increased by an additional $1.0 billion in October 2017 (as expanded, the “June 2017 stock repurchase program”). In October 2017, the Company completed the June 2017 stock repurchase program, purchasing 77.4 million shares. In June 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance authorized a new stock repurchase program (the “June 2018 stock repurchase program”), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock of which the Company had repurchased $2.7 billion as of August 31, 2018. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date.

The Company purchased 72 million and 59 million shares under stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2018 and 2017 at a cost of $4.9 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.

Commercial paper
The Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may continue to borrow under it in future periods. The Company had $430 million commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of August 31, 2018 and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of August 31, 2017. The Company had average daily short-term borrowings of $1.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 2.11% for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 and no activity under its commercial paper program for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017.

Financing actions
On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a term loan credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the “2014 Term Loan Agreement”), which provided Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens with the ability to borrow up to £1.45 billion on an unsecured basis. On August 30, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance used available cash to repay in full all outstanding loans and obligations under the 2014 Term Loan Agreement, which, as of such date, consisted of the remaining unamortized amount of £1.41 billion ($1.83 billion at the August 31, 2017 spot rate of $1.295 to £1) aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans together with accrued interest thereon through, but excluding, the payment date, and the 2014 Term Loan Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms.

On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a five-year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the “2014 Revolving Credit Agreement”), which had available credit of $3.0 billion, of which $500 million was available for the issuance of letters of credit. The 2014 Revolving Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms and conditions as of August 29, 2018, and as of that date, there were no borrowings outstanding. The 2014 Revolving Credit Facility was terminated concurrently with the execution of the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement described below.

On November 18, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued several series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes totaling $8.0 billion, with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2044. All such notes have fixed interest rates, with the exception of the $750 million floating rate notes due 2016, which were repaid in full in May 2016 and which had a floating rate based on the three month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 45 basis points. On August 28, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance redeemed in full its $750 million 1.750% notes due 2017 at a make-whole redemption price.

On June 1, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued in an underwritten public offering $1.2 billion of 1.750% notes due 2018 (the “2018 notes”), $1.5 billion of 2.600% notes due 2021 (the “2021 notes”), $0.8 billion of 3.100% notes due 2023 (the “2023 notes”), $1.9 billion of 3.450% notes due 2026 (the “2026 notes”) and $0.6 billion of 4.650% notes due 2046 (the “2046 notes”). Because the merger with Rite Aid was not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017, the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes were redeemed on June 5, 2017 under the special mandatory redemption terms of the indenture governing such notes. The 2026 notes and 2046 notes remain outstanding in accordance with their respective terms.

On February 1, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, the “February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement”) with the lenders from time to time party thereto and, on August 1, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into an amendment agreement thereto. The terms and conditions of the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement were unchanged by the amendment other than the extension of the facility termination date to the earlier of (a) January 31, 2019 and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. Borrowings under the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliance’s option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliance’s credit ratings. As of August 31, 2018, there were no borrowings under the February 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement.

On August 24, 2017, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with the lenders from time to time party thereto (the “August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement”) and a $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (the “2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement” and together with the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement, the “August 2017 Credit Agreements”). The August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility with a facility termination date of the earlier of (a) January 31, 2019, subject to any extension thereof pursuant to the terms of the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate commitments provided by the lenders thereunder. As of August 31, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under the August 2017 Revolving Credit Agreement. The 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement is an unsecured “multi-draw” term loan facility maturing on March 30, 2019. As of August 31, 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance had $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the 2017 Term Loan Credit Agreement and no additional commitments were available. Borrowings under the August 2017 Credit Agreements will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliance’s option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliance’s credit ratings.

On August 29, 2018, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a revolving credit agreement (the “2018 Revolving Credit Agreement”) with the lenders and letter of credit issuers from time to time party thereto. The 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement is an unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate commitment in the amount of $3.5 billion, with a letter of credit subfacility commitment amount of $500 million. The facility termination date is the earlier of (a) August 29, 2023, subject to the extension thereof pursuant to the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement and (b) the date of termination in whole of the aggregate amount of the revolving commitments pursuant to the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the 2018 Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliance’s option, the alternate base rate or the Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliance’s credit ratings.

From time to time, the Company may also enter into other credit facilities, including in March 2018, a $350 million short-term unsecured revolving credit facility which was undrawn as of August 31, 2018 and which was terminated in accordance with its terms and conditions in September 2018.

----------------- --------------------- ---------------------- -------

Rating Agency Long-Term Debt Rating CommercialPaper Rating Outlook
Fitch BBB F2 Stable
Moody’s Baa2 P-2 Stable
Standard & Poor’s BBB A-2 Stable

In assessing the Company’s credit strength, each rating agency considers various factors including the Company’s business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. The Company’s credit ratings impact its borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company’s debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

AmerisourceBergen relationship
Pursuant to arrangements with AmerisourceBergen, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time as described under “--AmerisourceBergen Corporation relationship” above. Subject to applicable legal and contractual requirements, share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1.

See note 5, equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The information set forth in note 10, commitments and contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in part II, item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. We use the following methods to determine our estimates:

Business combinations – We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.

For intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.

Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.

- 52 -

Table of Contents

Judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment – Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.

The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.

We also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the Company’s fair value as implied by the market value of the Company’s equity securities. This comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. However, future declines in the overall market value of the Company’s equity securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

The fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately 11% to approximately 312%. The fair value of our Boots reporting unit, within our Retail Pharmacy International division, is in excess of its carrying value by approximately 11%. We will continue to monitor the U.K. industry and market trends and the impact it may have on the Boots reporting unit. See note 6, goodwill and other intangible assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability.

Cost of sales and inventory – Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and primarily on a first-in first-out (“FIFO”) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments.

Equity method investments – We use the equity method of accounting for equity investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions.

We evaluate equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.

Pension and postretirement benefits – We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our non-U.S. employees. We also have a postretirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status, date of hire and or length of service. Our pension and postretirement plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. In determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $354 million to our pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $21 million.

Our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. Our postretirement healthcare plan is not funded.

Income taxes – We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 Amounts do not include provisional one-time transition tax liability as a result of the U.S. tax law changes. The Company recorded a provisional one-time transition tax expense of $750 million during the fiscal year 2018. The Company will make an election to pay the transition tax liability in installments over eight years and, therefore, $682 million of the resulting income taxes liability was recorded as noncurrent income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of August 31, 2018.

The information in the foregoing table is presented as of August 31, 2018 and accordingly does not reflect obligations under agreements the Company entered into after that date.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company does not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities and, except as described herein, the Company does not have significant exposure to any off-balance sheet arrangements. The term “off-balance sheet arrangement” generally means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the Company is a party, under which the Company has: (i) any obligation arising under a guarantee contract, derivative instrument or variable interest; or (ii) a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support for such assets.

At August 31, 2018, the Company has issued $218 million in letters of credit, primarily related to insurance obligations. The Company also had $45 million of guarantees outstanding at August 31, 2018. The Company remains secondarily liable on 16 leases. The maximum potential undiscounted future payments related to these leases was $22 million at August 31, 2018.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
