The Centers consist of consolidated Centers (“Consolidated Centers”) and unconsolidated joint venture Centers (“Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers”) as set forth in “Item 2. Properties,” unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Management Companies.
The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

On November 1, 2017, the Company paid off in full the $95.0 million mortgage loan payable on Stonewood Center. The Company funded the repayment of the mortgage loan payable from borrowings under its line of credit.
On December 4, 2017, the Company replaced the existing loan on Santa Monica Place with a new $300.0 million loan that bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.35% and matures on December 9, 2022, including three one-year extension options. The loan is covered by an interest rate cap agreement that effectively prevents LIBOR from exceeding 4.00%. The Company used the net proceeds to pay down its line of credit and for general corporate purposes.
On January 22, 2018, the Company's joint venture in Fashion District Philadelphia obtained a $250.0 million term loan that bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.0% and matures on January 22, 2023. Concurrent with the loan closing, the joint venture borrowed $150.0 million on the term loan and expects to borrow the remaining $100.0 million in the first quarter of 2018. The Company used its share of the proceeds to pay down its line of credit and for general corporate purposes.
On February 5, 2018, the Company's joint venture in Broadway Plaza received a loan commitment for $450.0 million on the property at a fixed rate of 4.18% for twelve years. The loan is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018. The Company plans to use its share of the loan proceeds to pay down its line of credit.
Redevelopment and Development Activity:
The Company's joint venture is proceeding with the development of Fashion District Philadelphia, a redevelopment of an 850,000 square foot shopping center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The project is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. The total cost of the project is estimated to be between $305.0 million and $365.0 million, with $152.5 million to $182.5 million estimated to be the Company's pro rata share. The Company has funded $127.2 million of the total $254.4 million incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2017.
The Company is currently in the process of redeveloping a 250,000 square foot former Sears store at Kings Plaza Shopping Center.  The Company expects to complete the project in the second quarter of 2018.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company has incurred $63.6 million in costs and anticipates the total cost of the project to be between $95.0 million and $100.0 million.
Other Transactions and Events:
On March 9, 2015, the Company received an unsolicited, conditional proposal from Simon Property Group, Inc. (“Simon”) to acquire the Company. The Company’s Board of Directors, after consulting with its financial, real estate and legal advisors, unanimously determined that the Simon proposal substantially undervalued the Company and was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. On March 20, 2015, the Company received a revised, unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company from Simon, which Simon described as its best and final proposal. The Company’s Board of Directors carefully reviewed the revised proposal with the assistance of its financial, real estate and legal advisors, and determined that the revised proposal continued to substantially undervalue the Company and that pursuing the proposed transaction at that time was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
On June 30, 2015, the Company conveyed Great Northern Mall, an 895,000 square foot regional shopping center in Clay, New York, to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and was discharged from the mortgage note payable. The mortgage note payable was a non-recourse loan. As a result, the Company recognized a loss of $1.6 million on the extinguishment of debt.

On September 30, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of the Company's outstanding common shares over the period ending September 30, 2017, as market conditions warranted (the "2015 Stock Buyback Program"). On November 12, 2015, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program ("ASR") to repurchase $400.0 million of the Company's common stock. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of $400.0 million and received an initial share delivery of 4,140,788 shares. On January 19, 2016, the ASR was completed and the Company received an additional delivery of 970,609 shares. The average price of the 5,111,397 shares repurchased under the ASR was $78.26 per share. The ASR was funded from proceeds in connection with the financing and sale of the ownership interest in the PPR Portfolio (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity").
On October 30, 2015, the Company declared two special dividends/distributions ("Special Dividend"), each of $2.00 per share of common stock and per OP Unit. The first Special Dividend was paid on December 8, 2015 to stockholders and OP Unit holders of record on November 12, 2015.  The second Special Dividend was paid on January 6, 2016 to common stockholders and OP Unit holders of record on November 12, 2015. The Special Dividends were funded from proceeds in connection with the financing and sale of ownership interests in the PPR Portfolio and Arrowhead Towne Center (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity").
On February 17, 2016, the Company entered into an ASR to repurchase $400.0 million of the Company's common stock. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of $400.0 million and received an initial share delivery of 4,222,193 shares. On April 19, 2016, the ASR was completed and the Company received delivery of an additional 861,235 shares. The average price of the 5,083,428 shares repurchased under the ASR was $78.69 per share. The ASR was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, which had been paid down from the proceeds from the recently completed Joint Venture Transactions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity").
On May 9, 2016, the Company entered into an ASR to repurchase the remaining $400.0 million of the Company's common stock authorized for repurchase. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of $400.0 million and received an initial share delivery of 3,964,812 shares. On July 11, 2016, the ASR was completed and the Company received delivery of an additional 1,104,162 shares. The average price of the 5,068,974 shares repurchased under the ASR was $78.91 per share. The ASR was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, which had been recently paid down from the proceeds from the recently completed Joint Venture Transactions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity"). The total number of shares repurchased under the 2015 Stock Buyback Program was 15,263,799 at an average price of $78.62.
On July 15, 2016, the Company conveyed Flagstaff Mall, a 347,000 square foot regional shopping center in Flagstaff, Arizona, to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and was discharged from the mortgage note payable. The mortgage note payable was a non-recourse loan. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of $5.3 million on the extinguishment of debt.
On February 12, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common shares as market conditions and the Company’s liquidity warrant. Repurchases may be made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, structured or derivative transactions, including ASR transactions, or other methods of acquiring shares and pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Act of 1934, from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. During the period from February 12, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 3,627,390 of its common shares for $221.4 million, representing an average price of $61.01 per share. The Company funded the repurchases from the net proceeds of the sale of Cascade Mall and Northgate Mall (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions"), its share of the proceeds from the sale of office buildings at Fashion District Philadelphia and Country Club Plaza (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions") and from borrowings under its line of credit.
On February 1 and 2, 2018, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 10 percent. The Company expects to incur total one-time charges of approximately $12 million in connection with this workforce reduction and will recognize all of these charges in the first quarter of 2018.  As a result of this workforce reduction, based on currently budgeted amounts, the Company anticipates expenses, exclusive of one-time charges, will be reduced by approximately $10 million for 2018.
Inflation:
In the last five years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically throughout the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, approximately 5% to 15% of the leases for spaces 10,000 square feet and under expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. The Company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses,

46

generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center, which places the burden of cost control on the Company. Additionally, certain leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses.
Seasonality:
The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter.

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, capitalization of costs and fair value measurements. The Company's significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical.
Revenue Recognition:
Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight line rent adjustment." Currently, 48% of the leases contain provisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. Estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases.
Property:
Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings.
Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

-------------------------- ------------

Buildings and improvements 5 - 40 years
Tenant improvements 5 - 7 years
Equipment and furnishings 5 - 7 years

Capitalization of Costs:
The Company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment, development, renovation and improvement of properties. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. These capitalized costs include direct and certain indirect costs clearly associated with the project. Indirect costs include real estate taxes, insurance and certain shared administrative costs. In assessing the amounts of direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made to projects based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent on each activity. Indirect costs not clearly associated with specific projects are expensed as period costs. Capitalized indirect costs are allocated to development and redevelopment activities based on the square footage of the portion of the building not held available for immediate occupancy. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. For projects with extended lease-up periods, the Company ends the capitalization when significant activities have

47

ceased, which does not exceed the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the construction is substantially complete.
Acquisitions:
The Company allocates the estimated fair value of acquisitions to land, building, tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. In addition, any assumed mortgage notes payable are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of the land and buildings is determined utilizing an “as if vacant” methodology. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with “cost avoidance” of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the “assumed vacant” property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below-market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus any below-market fixed rate renewal options. Above or below-market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below-market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases. The remaining lease terms of below-market leases may include certain below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. In considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below-market fixed-rate lease renewal option, the Company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the Center, the Company's relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space. The initial allocation of purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may change when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which does not exceed one year. The purchase price allocation is described as preliminary if it is not yet final. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenues and expenses.
The Company immediately expenses costs associated with business combinations as period costs.
Remeasurement gains are recognized when the Company obtains control of an existing equity method investment to the extent that the fair value of the existing equity investment exceeds the carrying value of the investment.
Asset Impairment:
The Company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include projected rental revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as well as estimated holding periods and capitalization rates. If an impairment indicator exists, the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets. The Company generally holds and operates its properties long-term, which decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable. Properties classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically, and as deemed necessary, for recoverability and valuation declines that are other-than-temporary.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions.
Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and

48

yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made.
Deferred Charges:
Costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. As these deferred leasing costs represent productive assets incurred in connection with the Company's provision of leasing arrangements at the Centers, the related cash flows are classified as investing activities within the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows:

------------------------ ------------

Deferred lease costs 1 - 15 years
Deferred financing costs 1 - 15 years

Results of Operations
Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred because of the transactions affecting the Company's properties described above, including those related to the Redevelopment Properties, the Joint Venture Centers and the Disposition Properties (as defined below).
For purposes of the discussion below, the Company defines "Same Centers" as those Centers that are substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Non-Same Centers for comparison purposes include those Centers or properties that are going through a substantial redevelopment often resulting in the closing of a portion of the Center (“Redevelopment Properties”), those properties that have recently transitioned to or from equity method joint ventures to consolidated assets ("Joint Venture Centers") and properties that have been disposed of ("Disposition Properties"). The Company moves a Center in and out of Same Centers based on whether the Center is substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Accordingly, the Same Centers consist of all consolidated Centers, excluding the Redevelopment Properties, the Joint Venture Centers and the Disposition Properties for the periods of comparison.
For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016 and the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015, the Redevelopment Properties are the expansion portion of Green Acres Mall, Paradise Valley Mall and Westside Pavilion.
For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016, the Joint Venture Centers are Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015, the Joint Venture Centers are Inland Center, the PPR Portfolio, Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio. The change in revenues and expenses at the Joint Venture Centers for the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the conversion of Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from Consolidated Centers to Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers. The change in revenues and expenses at the Joint Venture Centers for the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the conversion of the PPR Portfolio, Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from Consolidated Centers to Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers.
For comparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016, the Disposition Properties are 500 North Michigan Avenue, Cascade Mall, Northgate Mall, Flagstaff Mall and Capitola Mall. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December 31, 2015, the Disposition Properties are Flagstaff Mall, Capitola Mall, Panorama Mall and Great Northern Mall.

49

Unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures.
The Company considers tenant annual sales per square foot (for tenants in place for a minimum of 12 months or longer and 10,000 square feet and under) for regional shopping centers, occupancy rates (excluding large retail stores or "Anchors") for the Centers and releasing spreads (i.e. a comparison of initial average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the trailing twelve months to average base rent per square foot at expiration for the leases expiring during the year based on the spaces 10,000 square feet and under) to be key performance indicators of the Company's internal growth.
Tenant sales per square foot increased from $630 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to $660 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Occupancy rate decreased from 95.4% at December 31, 2016 to 95.0% at December 31, 2017. Releasing spreads increased 15.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. These calculations exclude Centers under development or redevelopment and property dispositions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Releasing spreads remained positive as the Company was able to lease available space at average higher rents than the expiring rental rates, resulting in a releasing spread of $7.81 per square foot ($59.20 on new and renewal leases executed compared to $51.39 on leases expiring), representing a 15.2% increase for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company expects that releasing spreads will continue to be positive for 2018 as it renews or relets leases that are scheduled to expire. These leases that are scheduled to expire represent approximately 982,000 square feet of the Centers, accounting for 13.1% of the GLA of mall stores and freestanding stores, for spaces 10,000 square feet and under, as of December 31, 2017.
During the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company signed 229 new leases and 382 renewal leases comprising approximately 1.0 million square feet of GLA, of which 0.7 million square feet related to the consolidated Centers. The annual initial average base rent for new and renewal leases was $59.20 per square foot for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2017 with an average tenant allowance of $23.24 per square foot.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016
Revenues:
Minimum and percentage rents (collectively referred to as "rental revenue") decreased by $26.0 million, or 4.1%, from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in rental revenue is attributed to a decrease of $18.3 million from the Disposition Properties, $17.7 million from the Redevelopment Properties and $3.3 million from the Joint Venture Centers offset in part by an increase of $13.3 million from the Same Centers. The increase in rental revenue at the Same Centers is primarily due to an increase in lease termination income and an increase in leasing spreads.
Rental revenue includes the amortization of above and below-market leases, the amortization of straight-line rents and lease termination income. The amortization of above and below-market leases decreased from $12.8 million in 2016 to $1.0 million in 2017. The decrease in amortization of above and below-market leases is primarily due to the early termination of tenant leases in 2016. The amortization of straight-line rents increased from $5.2 million in 2016 to $8.6 million in 2017. Lease termination income decreased from $19.2 million in 2016 to $18.1 million in 2017.
Tenant recoveries decreased $22.0 million, or 7.2%, from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in tenant recoveries is attributed to a decrease of $9.3 million from the Same Centers, $8.3 million from the Disposition Properties, $2.8 million from the Redevelopment Properties and $1.6 million from the Joint Venture Centers. The decrease in tenant recoveries from the Same Centers is primarily due to a decrease in property tax expense and utility cost.
Management Companies' revenue increased from $39.5 million in 2016 to $43.4 million in 2017. The increase in Management Companies' revenue is due to an increase in development and leasing fees from joint ventures.
 Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:
Shopping center and operating expenses decreased $12.4 million, or 4.0%, from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses is attributed to a decrease of $11.5 million from the Disposition Properties, $1.3 million from the Redevelopment Properties and $0.8 million from the Joint Venture Centers offset in part by an increase of $1.2 million from the Same Centers.
Management Companies' Operating Expenses:
Management Companies' operating expenses increased $1.8 million from 2016 to 2017.

50

REIT General and Administrative Expenses:
REIT general and administrative expenses were $28.2 million for 2016 and 2017.
Depreciation and Amortization:
Depreciation and amortization decreased $13.1 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to a decrease of $10.5 million from the Disposition Properties, $4.4 million from the Same Centers and $1.5 million from the Joint Venture Centers offset in part by an increase of $3.3 million from the Redevelopment Properties.
Interest Expense:
Interest expense increased $8.1 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributed to an increase of $6.8 million from borrowings under the line of credit, $5.4 million from the Same Centers and $0.2 million from the Redevelopment Properties offset in part by a decrease of $3.4 million from the Disposition Properties and $0.9 million from the Joint Venture Centers. The increase in interest expense at the Same Centers is primarily due to a new loan on Fresno Fashion Fair in 2016 (See "Financing Activity" in Management's Overview and Summary).
The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which increased from $10.3 million in 2016 to $13.2 million in 2017.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt, net:
Gain on extinguishment of debt, net decreased $1.7 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in gain on extinguishment of debt is due to the gain of $5.3 million on the settlement of the mortgage note payable on Flagstaff Mall by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in 2016 (See “Other Transactions and Events” in Management’s Overview and Summary) offset in part by a loss of $3.6 million on the early extinguishment of debt on Arrowhead Towne Center in 2016 (See “Financing Activities” in Management’s Overview and Summary).
Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:
Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $28.6 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase is primarily due to the conversion of Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from Consolidated Centers to Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers in 2016 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), the Company's share of the gain on the sales of office buildings at Fashion District Philadelphia and Country Club Plaza in 2017 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and the Company's shares of the gain on land sales at other joint ventures in 2017.
Gain on Sale or Write down of Assets, net:
Gain on sale or write down of assets, net decreased $372.9 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease is primarily due to the gain of $467.2 million on the sales of ownership interests in Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio in 2016 and the sale of Capitola Mall in 2016 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by the gain of $74.2 million on the sales of Cascade Mall, Northgate Mall and 500 North Michigan Avenue in 2017 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Net Income:
Net income decreased $393.2 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in net income is primarily attributed to a decrease of $372.9 million from gain on sale or write down of assets, net as discussed above.
Funds From Operations ("FFO"):
Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFO—diluted decreased 9.3% from $642.3 million in 2016 to $582.9 million 2017. For a reconciliation of FFO and FFO—diluted to net income available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see "Funds From Operations ("FFO")" below.
Operating Activities:
Cash provided by operating activities decreased from $429.5 million in 2016 to $386.4 million in 2017. The decrease is primarily due to changes in assets and liabilities and the results as discussed above.

51

Investing Activities:
Cash provided by investing activities decreased $266.2 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets of $469.0 million and a decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $176.1 million offset in part by a decrease in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures of $312.9 million and a decrease in development, redevelopment and renovations of $51.3 million.
The decrease in cash proceeds from the sale of assets is attributed to the sales of ownership interests in Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio in 2016 and the sale of Capitola Mall in 2016 offset in part by the sale of Cascade Mall, Northgate Mall and 500 North Michigan Avenue in 2017 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). The decrease in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in Country Club Plaza in 2016 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Financing Activities:
Cash used in financing activities decreased $298.8 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to a decrease in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $1.2 billion, a decrease in the repurchases of the Company's common stock of $578.6 million (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) and a decrease in cash dividends and distributions of $335.5 million offset in part by a decrease in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $1.8 billion and an increase in distributions to co-venture partner of $85.6 million.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015
Revenues:
Rental revenue decreased by $148.1 million, or 18.9%, from 2015 to 2016. The decrease in rental revenue is attributed to a decrease of $179.3 million from the Joint Venture Centers and $15.4 million from the Disposition Properties offset in part by an increase of $44.9 million from the Same Centers and $1.7 million from the Redevelopment Properties. The increase in rental revenue as the Same Centers is primarily due to an increase in lease termination income, as provided below, and an increase in leasing spreads.
The amortization of above and below-market leases decreased from $16.5 million in 2015 to $12.8 million in 2016 primarily due to the Joint Venture Centers. The amortization of straight-line rents decreased from $7.2 million in 2015 to $5.2 million in 2016. Lease termination income increased from $9.7 million in 2015 to $19.2 million in 2016.
Tenant recoveries decreased $109.8 million, or 26.5%, from 2015 to 2016. The decrease in tenant recoveries is attributed to a decrease of $88.5 million from the Joint Venture Centers, $13.6 million from the Same Centers, $6.8 million from the Disposition Properties and $0.9 million from the Redevelopment Properties.
Management Companies' revenue increased from $26.3 million in 2015 to $39.5 million in 2016. The increase in Management Companies' revenue is due to an increase in management fees as a result of the conversion of the PPR Portfolio, Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and an increase in development and leasing fees from other joint ventures.
Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:
Shopping center and operating expenses decreased $72.2 million, or 19.0%, from 2015 to 2016. The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses is attributed to a decrease of $69.5 million from the Joint Venture Centers and $8.1 million from the Disposition Properties offset in part by an increase of $5.1 million from the Same Centers and $0.3 million from the Redevelopment Properties. The increase in shopping center and operating expenses at the Same Centers is primarily due to an increase in property tax expense.
Management Companies' Operating Expenses:
Management Companies' operating expenses increased $6.0 million from 2015 to 2016 due to the conversion of the PPR Portfolio, Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and an increase in share and unit-based compensation costs.

52

REIT General and Administrative Expenses:
REIT general and administrative expenses decreased by $1.7 million from 2015 to 2016.
Costs related to Unsolicited Takeover Offer:
The Company incurred $25.2 million in costs in 2015 related to evaluating and responding to an unsolicited takeover offer (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Depreciation and Amortization:
Depreciation and amortization decreased $116.0 million from 2015 to 2016. The decrease in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to a decrease of $116.8 million from the Joint Venture Centers and $5.5 million from the Disposition Properties offset in part by an increase of $4.3 million from the Same Centers and $2.0 million from the Redevelopment Properties.
Interest Expense:
Interest expense decreased $48.3 million from 2015 to 2016. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributed to a decrease of $34.9 million from the Joint Venture Centers, $9.3 million from the Same Centers, $2.3 million from a term loan, $1.9 million from the Disposition Properties and $1.0 million from the Redevelopment Properties offset in part by an increase of $1.1 million from borrowings under the line of credit. The decrease in interest expense at the Same Centers is primarily due to the payoff of the mortgage notes payable on Eastland Mall, Valley Mall and Valley River Center in 2015 offset in part by a new loan on Fresno Fashion Fair in 2016 (See "Financing Activity" in Management's Overview and Summary).
The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which decreased from $13.1 million in 2015 to $10.3 million in 2016.
Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:
Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $11.8 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase is primarily due to the opening of the Hyatt Regency Tysons Corner Center and VITA Tysons Corner Center in 2015 and the conversion of the PPR Portfolio, Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Gain on Sale or Write down of Assets, net:
Gain on sale or write down of assets, net increased $37.1 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase in gain on sale of assets is primarily due to the increase in gain of $82.4 million on the Joint Venture Transactions and the sale of properties (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by an increase in impairment loss of $29.7 million and a charge of $12.2 million from the settlement of a contingent consideration obligation in 2016.
Gain on Remeasurement of Assets:
The gain on remeasurement of assets of $22.1 million in 2015 is attributed to the purchase of the remaining 50% ownership interest in Inland Center that the Company did not previously own (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Net Income:
Net income increased $31.9 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to an increase of $37.1 million from gain on sale or write down of assets as discussed above.
Funds From Operations:
Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFO—diluted was $642.3 million in 2015 and 2016. For a reconciliation of FFO and FFO—diluted to net income available to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see "Funds From Operations ("FFO")" below.
Operating Activities:
Cash provided by operating activities decreased from $555.0 million in 2015 to $429.5 million in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to the conversion of the PPR Portfolio, Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), changes in assets and liabilities and the results as discussed above.

53

Investing Activities:
Cash provided by investing activities increased $544.1 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $338.5 million, an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets of $77.4 million, a decrease in development, redevelopment and renovations of $60.7 million, a decrease in acquisition of property of $26.3 million and a decrease in restricted cash of $19.9 million.
The increase in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the receipt of the Company's share of the net proceeds from the loans placed on Country Club Plaza, The Shops at North Bridge and The Village at Corte Madera in 2016 (See "Financing Activity" in Management's Overview and Summary).
Financing Activities:
Cash used in financing activities increased $412.8 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $879.5 million and an increase in the repurchases of the Company's common stock of $399.9 million (See "Other Transactions" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by a decrease in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $846.3 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses and debt service and dividend requirements for the next twelve months through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its unsecured line of credit.
The following tables summarize capital expenditures and lease acquisition costs incurred at the Centers (at the Company's pro rata share) for the years ended December 31:

--------------------------------------------------------------- ------- ------- ---- ------- ---- ------- ------- - -------

(Dollars in thousands) 2017 2016 2015
Consolidated Centers:
Acquisitions of property and equipment $ 38,153 $ 56,759 $ 79,753
Development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of Centers 152,095 183,220 218,741
Tenant allowances 11,484 19,229 30,368
Deferred leasing charges 26,526 24,845 26,835
 $ 228,258 $ 284,053 $ 355,697
Joint Venture Centers (at Company's pro rata share):
Acquisitions of property and equipment $ 16,069 $ 349,819 $ 160,001
Development, redevelopment, expansion and renovation of Centers 121,787 101,124 132,924
Tenant allowances 6,779 11,271 6,285
Deferred leasing charges 6,154 7,070 3,348
 $ 150,789 $ 469,284 $ 302,558

The Company expects amounts to be incurred during the next twelve months for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable or less than 2017 and that capital for those expenditures will be available from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings on property specific debt or unsecured corporate borrowings. The Company expects to incur between $200 million and $300 million during the next twelve months for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these major expenditures, developments and/or redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from a combination of debt or equity financings, which are expected to include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans.
The Company has also generated liquidity in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, through equity offerings and issuances, property refinancings, joint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets. For example, the Company's recently completed sale of Cascade Mall, Northgate Mall and 500 North Michigan Avenue (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), sales of office buildings at Fashion District Philadelphia and Country Club Plaza in 2017 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and the Joint Venture Transactions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), which included new debt or refinancings of existing debt on the properties (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary). The Company used these proceeds to pay down its line of credit, fund the Special Dividend (See "Other Transactions and Events" in

54

Management's Overview and Summary) and for other general corporate purposes, which included the repurchases of the Company's common stock under the 2015 Stock Buyback Program, which was completed in May 2016, and the 2017 Stock Buyback Program (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary). Furthermore, the Company has filed a shelf registration statement, which registered an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights, stock purchase contracts and units that may be sold from time to time by the Company. The Company expects any additional repurchases of the Company's common stock under the 2017 Stock Buyback Program to be funded by future sales of non-core assets, borrowings under its line of credit and/or refinancing transactions.
The capital and credit markets can fluctuate and, at times, limit access to debt and equity financing for companies. As demonstrated by the Company's recent activity as discussed below, the Company has been able to access capital; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. In the event that the Company has significant tenant defaults as a result of the overall economy and general market conditions, the Company could have a decrease in cash flow from operations, which could result in increased borrowings under its line of credit. These events could result in an increase in the Company's proportion of floating rate debt, which would cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future.
The Company had an equity distribution agreement with a number of sales agents (the "ATM Program") to issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million. The ATM Program expired by its terms in August 2017. The Company did not sell any shares under the ATM Program.
The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at December 31, 2017 was $7.7 billion (consisting of $5.2 billion of consolidated debt, less $319.6 million of noncontrolling interests, plus $2.8 billion of its pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgage notes collateralized by individual properties. The Company expects that all of the maturities during the next twelve months will be refinanced, restructured, extended and/or paid off from the Company's line of credit or cash on hand.
The Company believes that the pro rata debt provides useful information to investors regarding its financial condition because it includes the Company’s share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and, for consolidated debt, excludes the Company’s partners’ share from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. The Company has several significant joint ventures and presenting its pro rata share of debt in this manner can help investors better understand the Company’s financial condition after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures. The Company’s pro rata share of debt should not be considered as a substitute for the Company’s total consolidated debt determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit facility that bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 1.30% to 1.90%, depending on the Company's overall leverage level, and matures on July 6, 2020 with a one-year extension option. The line of credit can be expanded, depending on certain conditions, up to a total facility of $2.0 billion. All obligations under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed only by the Company. Based on the Company's leverage level as of December 31, 2017, the borrowing rate on the facility was LIBOR plus 1.45%. At December 31, 2017, total borrowings under the line of credit were $935.0 million less unamortized deferred finance costs of $7.5 million with a total interest rate of 3.13%.
Cash dividends and distributions for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $443.8 million. A total of $386.4 million was funded by operations. The remaining $57.5 million was funded from distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, which were included in the cash flows from investing activities section of the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants under its agreements.
At December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $91.0 million.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:
The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, the Company is contingently liable for $60.6 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relating to the Centers. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company.

Funds From Operations ("FFO")
The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company also presents FFO excluding early extinguishment of debt, net and costs related to unsolicited takeover offer.
FFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a more meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. The Company believes that FFO excluding extinguishment of debt, net and costs related to unsolicited take over offer provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance as it shows a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company's operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company's results. The Company believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities.
The Company believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts.
Management compensates for the limitations of FFO by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and a reconciliation of FFO and FFO-diluted to net income available to common stockholders. Management believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be compared with the Company's reported net income as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The following reconciles net income attributable to the Company to FFO and FFO-diluted for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars and shares in thousands):

NOTE 25. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Spin-Off of Delphi Technologies On December 4, 2017, the Company completed the Separation of its former Powertrain Systems segment by distributing to Aptiv shareholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies PLC ("Delphi Technologies"), a public limited company formed to hold the spun-off business. To effect the Separation, the Company distributed to its shareholders one ordinary share of Delphi Technologies for every three Aptiv ordinary shares outstanding as of November 22, 2017, the record date for the distribution. Shareholders received cash in lieu of any fractional ordinary shares of Delphi Technologies. Following the Separation, Delphi Technologies is now an independent public company. Aptiv did not retain any equity or other interests in Delphi Technologies. On December 4, 2017, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Company transferred to Delphi Technologies the assets and liabilities that comprised Delphi Technologies' business. The Company received a dividend of approximately $1,148 million from Delphi Technologies in connection with the Separation. Delphi Technologies financed this dividend through the issuance of approximately $1.55 billion of debt, consisting of a senior secured five-year $750 million term loan facility that was issued upon the spin-off and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior unsecured notes due 2025 that were issued in September 2017 (collectively, the "Delphi Technologies Debt"). In connection with the Separation, the Delphi Technologies Debt was transferred to Delphi Technologies and is no longer reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Also in connection with the Separation, the Company received $180 million in cash from Delphi Technologies pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement.

The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which increased from $10.3 million in 2016 to $13.2 million in 2017.
Gain on Extinguishment of Debt, net:
Gain on extinguishment of debt, net decreased $1.7 million from 2016 to 2017. The decrease in gain on extinguishment of debt is due to the gain of $5.3 million on the settlement of the mortgage note payable on Flagstaff Mall by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in 2016 (See “Other Transactions and Events” in Management’s Overview and Summary) offset in part by a loss of $3.6 million on the early extinguishment of debt on Arrowhead Towne Center in 2016 (See “Financing Activities” in Management’s Overview and Summary).

Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures increased $28.6 million from 2016 to 2017. The increase is primarily due to the conversion of Arrowhead Towne Center and the MAC Heitman Portfolio from Consolidated Centers to Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers in 2016 (See "]:
