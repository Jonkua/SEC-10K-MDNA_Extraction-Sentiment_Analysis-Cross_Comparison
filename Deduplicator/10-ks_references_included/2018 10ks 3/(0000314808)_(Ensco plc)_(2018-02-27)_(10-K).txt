In October 2017, as a result of the Merger, we issued 132.2 million of our Class A Ordinary shares, representing total equity consideration of $770.7 million based on a closing price of $5.83 per Class A ordinary share on October 5, 2017, the last trading day before the Merger Date.

In April, 2016, we closed an underwritten public offering of 65,550,000 Class A ordinary shares at $9.25 per share. We received net proceeds from the offering of $585.5 million.

In October 2016, we entered into a privately-negotiated exchange agreement whereby we issued 1,822,432 Class A ordinary shares, representing less than one percent of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares, in exchange for $24.5 million principal amount of our 2044 Notes, resulting in a pre-tax gain from debt extinguishment of $8.8 million.

As a U.K. company governed in part by the Companies Act, we cannot issue new shares (other than in limited circumstances) without being authorized by our shareholders. At our last annual general meeting, our shareholders authorized the allotment of 101.1 million Class A ordinary shares (or 202.2 million Class A ordinary shares in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue or other similar issue). On October 5, 2017, at our general shareholders meeting, our shareholders approved an increase to our allotment in the amount of 45.3 million Class A ordinary shares (or 90.2 million Class A ordinary shares in connection with an offer by way of rights issue or other similar issuance) to reflect the expected enlarged share capital of Ensco immediately following the completion of the Merger. The total allotment of 146.4 million Class A ordinary shares (or 292.4 million Class A ordinary shares in connection with an offer by way of rights issue or similar issuance) is authorized for a period up to the conclusion of our 2018 annual general meeting (or, if earlier, at the close of business on August 22, 2018).

Under English law, we are only able to declare dividends and return funds to our shareholders out of the accumulated distributable reserves on our statutory balance sheet. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our profitability, liquidity, financial condition, market outlook, reinvestment opportunities, capital requirements and other factors and restrictions our Board of Directors deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.
 During 2013, our shareholders approved a share repurchase program. Subject to certain provisions under English law, including the requirement of Ensco plc to have sufficient distributable reserves, we may repurchase up to a maximum of $2.0 billion in the aggregate under the program, but in no case more than 35.0 million shares. The program terminates during 2018. As of December 31, 2017, there had been no share repurchases under this program.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Information

Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations attributable to the net change in operating assets and liabilities for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 was as follows (in millions):

----------------------------------- ----- ---- ---- ------ ---- ----- ------ - - -----

 2017 2016 2015
Decrease in accounts receivable $ 83.2 $ 222.4 $ 246.1

Decrease in liabilities (3.8 ) (125.8 ) (158.3 )
 $ 65.4 $ 140.6 $ 113.5

During 2017, the net change in operating assets and liabilities declined by $75.2 million as compared to the prior year. The net change during 2017 was primarily due to a decline in accounts receivable due to lower revenues from contract drilling services, partially offset by an increase in prepaid taxes primarily due to the U.S. tax reform and a decline in liabilities related to lower operating levels across the fleet.

During 2016, the net change in operating assets and liabilities increased by $27.1 million as compared to the prior year. The net change during 2016 was primarily due to a decline in accounts receivable related to lower revenues from contract drilling services and a decline in prepaid taxes and other assets due to collections during the year, partially offset by a decline in liabilities related to lower operating levels across the fleet.

Cash paid for interest and income taxes for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 was as follows (in millions):

------------------------------------ ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - -----

 2017 2016 2015
Interest, net of amounts capitalized $ 199.8 $ 264.8 $ 249.3
Income taxes 62.8 56.4 97.3

Capitalized interest totaled $72.5 million, $45.7 million and $87.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capital expenditure accruals totaling $234.3 million, $11.5 million and $60.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were excluded from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In January 2018, we paid $207.4 million of the $218.3 million unpaid balance for ENSCO 123. The $207.4 million milestone payment was invoiced and included in accounts payable - trade as of December 31, 2017 on our consolidated balance sheet.

Amortization, net, includes amortization of deferred mobilization revenues and costs, deferred capital upgrade revenues, intangible amortization and other amortization.

Other includes amortization of debt discounts and premiums, deferred financing costs, deferred charges for income taxes incurred on intercompany transfers of drilling rigs and other items.

Concentration of Risk

We are exposed to credit risk relating to our receivables from customers, our cash and cash equivalents and investments and our use of derivatives in connection with the management of foreign currency exchange rate risk. We mitigate our credit risk relating to receivables from customers, which consist primarily of major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies, by performing ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain reserves for potential credit losses, which generally have been within our expectations. We mitigate our credit risk relating to cash and investments by focusing on diversification and quality of instruments. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of a portfolio of high-grade instruments. Custody of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is maintained at several well-capitalized financial institutions, and we monitor the financial condition of those financial institutions.

We mitigate our credit risk relating to counterparties of our derivatives through a variety of techniques, including transacting with multiple, high-quality financial institutions, thereby limiting our exposure to individual counterparties and by entering into ISDA Master Agreements, which include provisions for a legally enforceable master netting agreement, with our derivative counterparties. See "Note 6 - Derivative Instruments" for additional information on our derivative activity.

 The terms of the ISDA agreements may also include credit support requirements, cross default provisions, termination events or set-off provisions. Legally enforceable master netting agreements reduce credit risk by providing protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and generally permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.

Consolidated revenues by customer for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

As a result, we will not proceed with the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. 77 Share Repurchase Program In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 b...

In October 2017, as a result of the Merger, we issued 132.2 million of our Class A Ordinary shares, representing total equity consideration of $770.7 million based on a closing price of $5.83 per Class A ordinary share on October 5, 2017, the last trading day before the Merger Date.

In April, 2016, we closed an underwritten public offering of 65,550,000 Class A ordinary shares at $9.25 per share. We received net proceeds from the offering of $585.5 million.

In October 2016, we entered into a privately-negotiated exchange agreement whereby we issued 1,822,432 Class A ordinary shares, representing less than one percent of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares, in exchange for $24.5 million principal amount of our 2044 Notes, resulting in a pre-tax gain from debt extinguishment of $8.8 million.

As a U.K. company governed in part by the Companies Act, we cannot issue new shares (other than in limited circumstances) without being authorized by our shareholders. At our last annual general meeting, our shareholders authorized the allotment of 101.1 million Class A ordinary shares (or 202.2 million Class A ordinary shares in connection with an offer by way of a rights issue or other similar issue). On October 5, 2017, at our general shareholders meeting, our shareholders approved an increase to our allotment in the amount of 45.3 million Class A ordinary shares (or 90.2 million Class A ordinary shares in connection with an offer by way of rights issue or other similar issuance) to reflect the expected enlarged share capital of Ensco immediately following the completion of the Merger. The total allotment of 146.4 million Class A ordinary shares (or 292.4 million Class A ordinary shares in connection with an offer by way of rights issue or similar issuance) is authorized for a period up to the conclusion of our 2018 annual general meeting (or, if earlier, at the close of business on August 22, 2018).

Under English law, we are only able to declare dividends and return funds to our shareholders out of the accumulated distributable reserves on our statutory balance sheet. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our profitability, liquidity, financial condition, market outlook, reinvestment opportunities, capital requirements and other factors and restrictions our Board of Directors deems relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.
 During 2013, our shareholders approved a share repurchase program. Subject to certain provisions under English law, including the requirement of Ensco plc to have sufficient distributable reserves, we may repurchase up to a maximum of $2.0 billion in the aggregate under the program, but in no case more than 35.0 million shares. The program terminates during 2018. As of December 31, 2017, there had been no share repurchases under this program.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Information

Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations attributable to the net change in operating assets and liabilities for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 was as follows (in millions):

----------------------------------- ----- ---- ---- ------ ---- ----- ------ - - -----

 2017 2016 2015
Decrease in accounts receivable $ 83.2 $ 222.4 $ 246.1
(Increase) decrease in other assets (14.0 ) 44.0 25.7
Decrease in liabilities (3.8 ) (125.8 ) (158.3 )
 $ 65.4 $ 140.6 $ 113.5

During 2017, the net change in operating assets and liabilities declined by $75.2 million as compared to the prior year. The net change during 2017 was primarily due to a decline in accounts receivable due to lower revenues from contract drilling services, partially offset by an increase in prepaid taxes primarily due to the U.S. tax reform and a decline in liabilities related to lower operating levels across the fleet.

During 2016, the net change in operating assets and liabilities increased by $27.1 million as compared to the prior year. The net change during 2016 was primarily due to a decline in accounts receivable related to lower revenues from contract drilling services and a decline in prepaid taxes and other assets due to collections during the year, partially offset by a decline in liabilities related to lower operating levels across the fleet.

Cash paid for interest and income taxes for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 was as follows (in millions):

------------------------------------ ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - -----

 2017 2016 2015
Interest, net of amounts capitalized $ 199.8 $ 264.8 $ 249.3
Income taxes 62.8 56.4 97.3

Capitalized interest totaled $72.5 million, $45.7 million and $87.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Capital expenditure accruals totaling $234.3 million, $11.5 million and $60.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were excluded from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In January 2018, we paid $207.4 million of the $218.3 million unpaid balance for ENSCO 123. The $207.4 million milestone payment was invoiced and included in accounts payable - trade as of December 31, 2017 on our consolidated balance sheet.

Amortization, net, includes amortization of deferred mobilization revenues and costs, deferred capital upgrade revenues, intangible amortization and other amortization.

Other includes amortization of debt discounts and premiums, deferred financing costs, deferred charges for income taxes incurred on intercompany transfers of drilling rigs and other items.

Concentration of Risk

We are exposed to credit risk relating to our receivables from customers, our cash and cash equivalents and investments and our use of derivatives in connection with the management of foreign currency exchange rate risk. We mitigate our credit risk relating to receivables from customers, which consist primarily of major international, government-owned and independent oil and gas companies, by performing ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain reserves for potential credit losses, which generally have been within our expectations. We mitigate our credit risk relating to cash and investments by focusing on diversification and quality of instruments. Cash equivalents and short-term investments consist of a portfolio of high-grade instruments. Custody of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments is maintained at several well-capitalized financial institutions, and we monitor the financial condition of those financial institutions.

We mitigate our credit risk relating to counterparties of our derivatives through a variety of techniques, including transacting with multiple, high-quality financial institutions, thereby limiting our exposure to individual counterparties and by entering into ISDA Master Agreements, which include provisions for a legally enforceable master netting agreement, with our derivative counterparties.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

[' operating results were reclassified to discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 and were previously included within the specified operating segment.

Losses on interest rate lock derivatives reclassified from AOCI into income (effective portion) were included in interest expense, net, in our consolidated statements of operations.

Cumulative paid represents the aggregate amount of contractual payments made from commencement of the construction agreement through December 31, 2017. Contractual payments made by Atwood prior to the Merger for ENSCO DS-13 (formerly Atwood Admiral) and ENSCO DS-14 (formerly Atwood Archer) are excluded.
