ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This Management Discussion and Analysis should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data included in this Form 10-K. Certain references to particular information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are made to assist readers.

OVERVIEW
Whirlpool Corporation delivered record revenues and the second highest year ever in terms of ongoing earnings per share in 2017. These results were solid, but we committed to delivering better results, and the challenges we faced caused us to revise our outlook throughout the year.
We experienced significant raw material inflation during the year, particularly resins, which turned into a $600 million challenge for 2017 and 2018 combined. Our results were also impacted by slow progress on European and China integration activities. These two combined factors led to a performance shortfall against our targets.
To offset these challenges, we have taken strong and decisive actions. We implemented cost-based price increases across the majority of our business effective early 2018, and have committed to a net fixed cost reduction of $150 million, which is already over 80 percent implemented. We firmly believe these are the right actions and that we have the right strategy to deliver improved performance in 2018 and our long-term goals.

nm: not meaningful
Consolidated net sales for 2017 increased 2.6% compared to 2016, primarily driven by favorable impacts from product price/mix and foreign currency. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, consolidated net sales for 2017 increased 1.5% compared to 2016. Consolidated net sales for 2016 decreased 0.8% compared to 2015 primarily driven by unfavorable impacts from foreign currency and product price/mix, partially offset by higher unit volumes. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, consolidated net sales for 2016 increased 1.6% compared to 2015.
For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures including net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
The chart below summarizes the balance of net sales by operating segments for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2017 decreased to 16.9% compared to 17.8% in 2016, primarily driven by unfavorable impacts from raw material inflation across all regions and product price/mix in the EMEA region, partially offset by cost productivity and restructuring benefits. The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2016 increased to 17.8% compared to 17.5% in 2015, primarily due to ongoing cost productivity and acquisition synergies, unit volume growth, and benefits from cost and capacity-reduction initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from product price/mix and foreign currency.

Selling, General and Administrative
The following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by operating segment:

------------------- ------------ ----- ------------------ ---- ---- - ------------------ - ----- ---- ------------------ ---- --- - ----- ---- -

 December 31,
Millions of dollars 2017 As a %of Net Sales 2016 As a %of Net Sales 2015 As a %of Net Sales
North America $ 795 6.8 % $ 783 7.0 % $ 780 7.3 %
EMEA 556 11.4 577 11.2 601 10.7
Latin America 331 9.7 304 9.5 314 9.4
Asia 240 16.3 216 15.2 226 16.0
Corporate/other 190 — 200 — 222 —
Consolidated $ 2,112 9.9 % $ 2,080 10.0 % $ 2,143 10.3 %

Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2017 remained flat compared to 2016. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2016 decreased compared to 2015, reflecting the favorable impact of acquisition synergies, partially offset by foreign currency.

Restructuring
We incurred restructuring charges of $275 million, $173 million and $201 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the full year 2018, we expect to incur up to $200 million of restructuring charges, which should result in ongoing substantial cost reductions.
For additional information about restructuring activities, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Interest and Sundry (Income) Expense
Interest and sundry (income) expenses were $87 million, $93 million and $46 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Interest and sundry (income) expense decreased $6 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a favorable impact from foreign currency. During 2016, interest and sundry (income) expense increased $47 million compared to 2015, primarily due to the reclassification of certain components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and postretirement benefits.
For additional information about the retrospective presentation and impact of net periodic benefit cost, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Interest Expense
Interest expenses were $162 million, $161 million and $165 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense increased by $1 million in 2017 compared to 2016. This was primarily due to higher average long-term debt balances. During 2016, interest expense decreased by $4 million compared to 2015. This was a result of lower average interest rates on long-term debt, offset by higher average long-term debt balances.
Income Taxes
Income tax expenses were $550 million, $186 million and $209 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in tax expense in 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to the one-time charge of approximately $420 million as result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the impact from a reduced tax rate on the valuations of deferred tax assets, the one-time deemed repatriation tax and other related items. Excluding the impact from tax reform, the decrease in tax expense compared to 2016 is primarily due to increased tax planning benefits. The decrease in tax expense in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to favorable audits and settlements and tax planning resulting in valuation allowance releases, partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings.
For additional information about our consolidated tax provision, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE
Earnings per diluted share presented below are net of tax, while each adjustment is presented on a pre-tax basis. The aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated 2018 full-year tax rate in the mid 20's. We currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2018 to be within the following ranges:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- - ------

 2018
 Current Outlook
Estimated earnings per diluted share, for the year ending December 31, 2018 $12.45 — $13.45
Including:
Restructuring Expense $(2.76)
Income Tax Impact $0.71

Industry demand
North America (1) 2% — 3%
EMEA 1% — 2%
Latin America (2) 1% — 2%
Asia 2% — 4%

(1) Reflects industry demand in the United States.
(2) Reflects industry demand in Brazil.
For the full-year 2018, we expect to generate cash from operating activities of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion and free cash flow of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion, including primarily acquisition related restructuring cash outlays of up to $300 million, pension contributions of $34 million and, with respect to free cash flow, capital expenditures of approximately $675 million.
The table below reconciles projected 2018 cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named non-GAAP measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations. We define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assets/businesses, and changes in restricted cash. The change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by Whirlpool to acquire majority control of Hefei Sanyo in 2014 and which are used to fund capital expenditures and technical resources to enhance Whirlpool China's research and development and working capital, as required by the terms of the Hefei Sanyo acquisition completed in October 2014. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- ----- - - -----

 2018
Millions of dollars Current Outlook
Cash provided by operating activities(1) $ 1,675 — $ 1,775
Capital expenditures, proceeds from sale of assets/businesses and changes in restricted cash ~ (675)
Free cash flow $ 1,000 — $ 1,100

(1) Financial guidance on a GAAP basis for cash provided by (used in) financing activities and cash provided by (used in) investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection, the Company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control.
The projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the Board of Directors of Whirlpool, and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as "ongoing" measures, including:

- -----------------------------------------
• Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)

- ------------
• Ongoing EBIT

- -------------------
• Ongoing EBIT margin

- ------------------------
• Sales excluding currency

- -----------------
• Ongoing net sales

- --------------
• Free cash flow

Ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Ongoing EBIT margin is calculated by dividing ongoing EBIT by ongoing net sales. Ongoing net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 excludes $32 million primarily related to an adjustment for trade promotion accruals in prior periods. Sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales, in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's exchange rate compared to the prior-year period net sales. Management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that free cash flow provides investors and stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the Company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. The Company provides free cash flow related metrics, such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales, as long-term management goals, not an element of its annual financial guidance, and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for these long-term goal metrics. Any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the Company's control.
We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These ongoing financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings available to Whirlpool, net sales, and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Please refer to a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt. We avoid concentrations of debt and reduce liquidity risk by diversifying the maturity structure. We have varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business. We regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities, which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives, funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities, providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions.
Our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending, restructuring activities, funding pension plans and returns to shareholders. We also have $376 million of term debt maturing in the next twelve months, and are currently evaluating our options, which may include repayment through refinancing, free cash flow generation, or cash on hand.
We monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending, depository, and derivative counterparty banks regularly, and take certain action to manage credit risk. We diversify our deposits and investments in short term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty.
As of December 31, 2017, we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in China and Brazil, which represented 2.7% and 1.1%, respectively. In addition, we did not have any third-party accounts receivable greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of North America. We continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017, of which substantially all was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States

taxes (if any) and withholding taxes payable to various countries. It is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation.
Sources and Uses of Cash
We met our cash needs during 2017 through cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and financing arrangements. Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 increased $111 million compared to the same period in 2016.
The following table summarizes the net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented. Significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2017 are discussed below:
Cash Flow Summary

---------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - - ----- -

Millions of dollars 2017 2016 2015
Cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 1,264 $ 1,203 $ 1,225
Investing activities (655 ) (588 ) (681 )
Financing activities (553 ) (278 ) (707 )
Effect of exchange rate changes 55 (24 ) (91 )
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 111 $ 313 $ (254 )

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
The increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2017 is primarily driven by effective credit management, improvement in working capital and lower cash expenditures related to legacy product corrective action, partially offset by lower net earnings.
The timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels, sales patterns, promotional programs, funding requirements, credit management, as well as receivable and payment terms. Depending on the timing of cash flows, the location of cash balances, as well as the liquidity requirements of each country, external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017 primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures, the net impact of purchases and proceeds related to held to maturity securities and investment in related businesses.
In June 2016, Whirlpool China Co., Ltd. ("Whirlpool China"), our majority-owned indirect subsidiary, entered into an agreement to return land use rights for land now occupied by two Whirlpool China plants in Hefei, China to a division of the Hefei municipal government.  The aggregate price for the return of land use rights was approximately RMB 687 million (approximately $103 million as of June 27, 2016). Whirlpool China received RMB 280 million (approximately $42 million) in 2016 and we received payments totaling RMB 280 million in 2017, with the remainder to be paid in 2018. The remaining balance is RMB 127 million (approximately $19 million as of December 31, 2017).
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 primarily reflects share repurchase activity, repayments of long-term debt and dividend payments, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term and short-term debt. Cash used in financing activities during 2016 primarily reflects share repurchase activity and repayments of long-term debt. Cash used in financing activities during 2015 primarily reflects share repurchase activity.

Whirlpool Subsidiary Share Repurchase

On July 12, 2016, Whirlpool S.A. ("WHR SA") and Brasmotor S.A. ("BMT"), both majority-owned indirect subsidiaries of Whirlpool Corporation, issued public announcements in Brazil reporting that Whirlpool do Brasil Ltda., the controlling shareholder of both WHR SA and BMT, intended to acquire the outstanding common and preferred shares of WHR SA and BMT by means of tender offers for the publicly-held shares. At that time, Whirlpool do Brasil Ltda. and other Whirlpool entities held 99.20% of the common and 95.68% of the preferred shares of WHR SA and 99.40% of the common and 93.55% of the preferred shares of BMT. The tender offers were launched in November 2016 and concluded in December 2016. The offer for BMT was successful and the squeeze-out was completed in January 2017 at a total cost of approximately $31 million. The WHR SA tender offer was abandoned because the minimum number of interested minority shareholders was not obtained.
Financing Arrangements
The Company had total committed credit facilities of approximately $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2017, which increased by $500 million from December 31, 2016 due primarily to an increase under the Amended Long-Term Facility entered into during the third quarter of 2017.  The facilities reflect the Company's growing global operations. The Company believes these facilities are sufficient to support its global operations. We had no borrowings outstanding under the committed credit facilities at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
For additional information about our financing arrangements, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Dividends
In April 2017, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.10 per share from $1 per share.
Repurchase Program
For additional information about our repurchase program, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds. These agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in Brazil, as is customary under local regulations, and other governmental obligations and debt agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately $407 million and $327 million outstanding under these agreements, respectively.
For additional information about our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee's expected period of employment. The determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions. Those key assumptions include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation, respectively. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense.
Our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2017 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2018 were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the sensitivity of our December 31, 2017 retirement obligations and 2018 retirement benefit costs of our United States plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results:

------------------------------------------------ ---------------- -------------------------------- -----------------

Health care cost trend rate +/-100bps – –

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for other postretirement benefit plans.

These sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years' financial results. Furthermore, the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results. For additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes
We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, general business credits and deductible temporary differences, that are expected to be realizable in future years. Realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and, where possible, considers projections of future profitability. If recovery is not more likely than not, we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. If future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had total deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $178 million and $150 million, respectively. Our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from $68 million in 2013 to $550 million in the current year. The tax expense has been influenced primarily by U.S. energy tax credits, foreign tax credits, audit settlements and adjustments, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income. Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including business profitability, tax planning strategies, and enacted tax laws.
In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 1, 5 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legacy Product Corrective Action Reserves
In the normal course of business, we engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues. As part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to consumers, we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues globally. As necessary, we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted.
As part of that process, in 2015, Whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with two of its dryer production platforms developed by Indesit. These dryer production platforms were developed prior to Whirlpool's acquisition of Indesit in October 2014. This led to Indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration. These discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required. Whirlpool has implemented modifications at the point of manufacture to ensure that dryers produced after October 2015 are not affected by this issue. An outreach and service campaign was undertaken to modify dryers that have already been sold. Such dryers were manufactured between April 2004 and October 2015 and sold in the UK and other countries in the EMEA region under the Hotpoint* and Indesit brand names, as well as various other brands owned by other manufacturers, distributors and retailers whose products Indesit produced.
During the third quarter of 2017, the corrective action was substantially complete and any remaining charges related to the action will be recorded under product warranty. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, Whirlpool had $61 million of cash settlements made related to the corrective action.
For additional information about the legacy product corrective action, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas.

Warranty Obligations
The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized. The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold. Warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations. For additional information about warranty obligations, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangibles
Certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, primarily trademark assets, which are not amortized. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had goodwill of approximately $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. We primarily have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets as of October 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible, including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible; actual and projected revenue and operating margin; relevant market data for both the Company and its peer companies; industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the Company's competitive position. Significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible is less than its carrying value.
In 2017, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and primarily perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, to evaluate goodwill and certain indefinite-life intangible assets.
Goodwill Valuations
In performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate each reporting unit's fair value under an income approach using a discounted cash flow model. The income approach uses each reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. The financial projections reflect management's best estimate of economic and market conditions over the projected period including forecasted revenue growth, operating margins, tax rate, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements. Other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values.
Additionally, we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the fair value estimate using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit's operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units. We consider the implied control premium and conclude whether it is reasonable based on other recent market transactions.
Based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment conducted on October 1, 2017, the fair values of our North America, Latin America and Asia reporting unit's exceeded their respective carrying values in a range of 72% to 183%.
Based on the quantitative assessment performed, the fair value of the EMEA reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 3%. The EMEA reporting unit has goodwill of $0.9 billion at December 31, 2017 primarily related to our acquisition of Indesit during the fourth quarter of 2014.
In evaluating the EMEA reporting unit, significant weight was provided to the forecasted operating margins and discount rate, as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit.

35

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Forecasted operating margins are expected to recover beginning in 2018 from the challenges associated with the integration beginning from the stabilization of operations, better supply chain effectiveness and commercial transformation efforts.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We used a discount rate of 11.75% based on market participant assumptions.

We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 5% reduction in the projected operating profit in each forecasted period would result in an impairment charge of approximately $86 million or $98 million, respectively.
If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment charge of our goodwill could occur, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.
Indefinite-Life Intangible Valuations
In performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite-life intangible assets other than goodwill, primarily trademarks, we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our long-range plans; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark; and a discount rate using a market based weighted-average cost of capital. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-life intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment loss.
Based on the quantitative assessment performed as of October 1, 2017, an impairment of our Diqua trademark was determined to exist, primarily driven by a significant decrease in the revenue projections due to a change in our brand strategy. This resulted in an impairment charge of $8 million which reduced the carrying value of this trademark to $31 million. There were no other impairments of indefinite-life intangible assets in 2017.
The fair value of the Indesit and Hotpoint* trademarks exceeded their carrying value by approximately 4% and 8%, respectively. For the Indesit and Hotpoint* trademarks, we expect revenue trends for these brands to improve as we continue to execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments.
The fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.
In performing the quantitative analysis on these trademark assets, significant assumptions used in our relief-from-royalty model included revenue growth rates, assumed royalty rates and the discount rate, which are discussed further below.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our long-range plans and vary from brand to brand. Adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the estimated fair values noting a 10% reduction of forecasted revenues to the Indesit and Hotpoint* trademark projections would result in an impairment charge of approximately $18 million and $5 million, respectively.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid for the use of the trademarks. The most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry, the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks, and the position of the trademarked products in the given market segment. Based on this analysis, we determined a royalty rate of 3% and 3.5% for our Indesit and Hotpoint* trademarks, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the estimated fair values for Indesit and Hotpoint* noting a 50 basis point reduction to the royalty rates would result in an impairment charge of approximately $42 million and $39 million, respectively.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we used the market based weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries, as applicable, as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets. Based on this analysis, we determined the discount rates to be 15.0% for Indesit and Hotpoint*. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the estimated fair values for Indesit and Hotpoint* noting a 100 basis point increase to the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $12 million and $3 million, respectively.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas.

OTHER MATTERS
For information regarding certain of our loss contingencies/litigation, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Grenfell Tower
On June 23, 2017, London's Metropolitan Police Service released a statement that it had identified a Hotpoint–branded refrigerator as the initial source of the Grenfell Tower fire in West London. U.K. authorities are conducting investigations, including regarding the cause and spread of the fire. The model in question was manufactured by Indesit Company between 2006 and 2009, prior to Whirlpool's acquisition of Indesit in 2014. We are fully cooperating with the investigating authorities and are in discussions with the U.K. regulator. As these matters are ongoing, we cannot speculate on their eventual outcomes or potential impact on our financial statements; accordingly, we have not recorded any significant charges in 2017. Claims may be filed related to this incident.
Antidumping and Safeguard Petition

As previously reported, in response to our December 2011 petition, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) issued a final determination in 2013 that Samsung and LG violated U.S. and international trade laws by dumping washers from South Korea and Mexico into the U.S., and antidumping duties are now imposed on certain washers imported from South Korea and Mexico. Rather than comply with the 2013 order, Samsung and LG moved their washer production to China. Samsung and LG resumed dumping washers into the U.S. and Whirlpool responded in 2015 by filing a new antidumping petition against their imports. The DOC issued a final determination in 2016 that Samsung and LG violated U.S. and international trade laws by dumping washers from China into the U.S. As a result of these decisions, certain washers imported from China are now subject to antidumping duties set by the DOC. As in the case of our December 2011 petition, the DOC and International Trade Commission (ITC) decisions could be followed by administrative review procedures and possible appeals over the next several years.

In May 2017, we filed a safeguard petition with the ITC to address our concerns that Samsung and LG are evading U.S. trade laws by moving production from countries (South Korea, Mexico and China) covered by existing DOC antidumping duties. In contrast to the country-specific antidumping remedy that the U.S. Government applied to Samsung and LG in South Korea, Mexico and China, a safeguard remedy can address imports from Samsung and LG from any country that causes injury to U.S. washer manufacturers. In October 2017, the ITC determined increased washer imports were a substantial cause of serious injury to the U.S. washer industry and made a remedy recommendation to the U.S. President to address past harm and prevent future injury. In January 2018, the President signed a remedy order that took effect on February 7, 2018, effective for three years. In the first year, the President's remedy order imposes a 20% tariff on the first 1.2 million large residential washing machines imported by Samsung and LG, and a 50% tariff on such imports in excess of 1.2 million. The President's remedy order also imposes a 50% tariff on washer tub, drum, and cabinet imports ("covered parts") in excess of 50,000 units annually. The tariff rates on washers and covered parts decline slightly during the second and third years of the remedy.
Post-Retirement Benefit Litigation
For information regarding post-retirement benefit litigation, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Customer Contracts
We regularly negotiate with trade customers, including Sears Holdings Corporation, regarding supply arrangements for future periods. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we were unable to reach agreement on terms with Sears regarding sales of our branded products, and consequently discontinued shipment of our branded products to Sears. These sales represented approximately 1% of our 2017 consolidated net sales. In the past, when faced with a potential volume reduction from any one particular segment of our trade distribution network, we generally have been able to offset such decline through increased sales throughout our broad distribution network.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. Certain statements contained in this annual report, including those within the forward-looking perspective section within this Management's Discussion and Analysis, and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us or on our behalf do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. As such, they are considered "forward-looking statements" which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as "may," "could," "will," "should," "possible," "plan," "predict," "forecast," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," and similar words or expressions. Our forward-looking statements generally relate to our growth strategies, financial results, product development, and sales efforts. These forward-looking statements should be considered with the understanding that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially.
This document contains forward-looking statements about Whirlpool Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Whirlpool") that speak only as of this date. Whirlpool disclaims any obligation to update these statements. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share, cash flow, productivity and raw material prices. Many risks, contingencies and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from Whirlpool's forward-looking statements. Among these factors are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers, and the impact of the changing retail environment; (2) Whirlpool's ability to maintain or increase sales to significant trade customers and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (3) Whirlpool's ability to maintain its reputation and brand image; (4) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, productivity improvements, and cost control objectives, and to leverage its global operating platform, and accelerate the rate of innovation; (5) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (6) acquisition and investment-related risks, including risks associated with our past acquisitions, and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets; (7) risks related to our international operations, including changes in foreign regulations, regulatory compliance and disruptions arising from political, legal and economic instability; (8) information technology system failures, data security breaches, network disruptions, and cybersecurity attacks; (9) product liability and product recall costs; (10) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (11) our ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees; (12) the impact of labor relations; (13) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel, resins, copper and aluminum) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (14) Whirlpool's ability to manage foreign currency fluctuations; (15) impacts from goodwill impairment and related charges; (16) triggering events or circumstances impacting the carrying value of our long-lived assets; (17) inventory and other asset risk; (18) the uncertain global economy and changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products; (19) health care cost trends, regulatory changes and variations between results and estimates that could increase future funding obligations for pension and postretirement benefit plans; (20) litigation, tax, and legal compliance risk and costs, especially if materially different from the amount we expect to incur or have accrued for, and any disruptions caused by the same; (21) the effects and costs of governmental investigations or related actions by third parties; and (22) changes in the legal and regulatory environment including environmental, health and safety regulations, and taxes and tariffs.

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value.

In connection with our entry into the agreement to acquire RB Foods, we entered into a commitment letter, dated July 18, 2017 (the "Commitment Letter"), under which certain banks agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") of up to $4.2 billion in the aggregate. On August 7, 2017, we entered into a Senior Unsecured Bridge Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions under which those financial institutions agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") for the purpose of providing the financing necessary to fund all or a portion of the consideration to be paid pursuant to the terms of the agreement related to the acquisition of RB Foods and related fees and expenses (the "Bridge Loan Commitment").

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions.

CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area.

The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

['S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This Management Discussion and Analysis should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data included in this Form 10-K. Certain references to particular information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are made to assist readers.

OVERVIEW
Whirlpool Corporation delivered record revenues and the second highest year ever in terms of ongoing earnings per share in 2017. These results were solid, but we committed to delivering better results, and the challenges we faced caused us to revise our outlook throughout the year.
We experienced significant raw material inflation during the year, particularly resins, which turned into a $600 million challenge for 2017 and 2018 combined. Our results were also impacted by slow progress on European and China integration activities. These two combined factors led to a performance shortfall against our targets.
To offset these challenges, we have taken strong and decisive actions. We implemented cost-based price increases across the majority of our business effective early 2018, and have committed to a net fixed cost reduction of $150 million, which is already over 80 percent implemented. We firmly believe these are the right actions and that we have the right strategy to deliver improved performance in 2018 and our long-term goals.

Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,397 million shares and 509 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification). As a result, we will not proceed with the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. 77 Share Repurchase Program In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 b...

Income Taxes
We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, general business credits and deductible temporary differences, that are expected to be realizable in future years. Realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and, where possible, considers projections of future profitability. If recovery is not more likely than not, we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. If future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had total deferred tax assets of $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $178 million and $150 million, respectively. Our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from $68 million in 2013 to $550 million in the current year. The tax expense has been influenced primarily by U.S. energy tax credits, foreign tax credits, audit settlements and adjustments, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income. Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including business profitability, tax planning strategies, and enacted tax laws.
In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 1, 5 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legacy Product Corrective Action Reserves
In the normal course of business, we engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues. As part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to consumers, we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues globally. As necessary, we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted.
As part of that process, in 2015, Whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with two of its dryer production platforms developed by Indesit. These dryer production platforms were developed prior to Whirlpool']:

Warranty Obligations
The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized. The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold. Warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations. For additional information about warranty obligations, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Life Intangibles
Certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, primarily trademark assets, which are not amortized. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had goodwill of approximately $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. We primarily have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets as of October 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible, including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-life intangible; actual and projected revenue and operating margin; relevant market data for both the Company and its peer companies; industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the Company']:
NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...
