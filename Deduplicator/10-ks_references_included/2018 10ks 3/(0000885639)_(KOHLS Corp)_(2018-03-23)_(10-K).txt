Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Executive Summary

As of February 3, 2018, we operated 1,158 Kohl's department stores, a website (www.Kohls.com), 12 FILA outlets, and four Off-Aisle clearance centers. Our Kohl's stores and website sell moderately priced proprietary and national brand apparel, footwear, accessories, beauty and home products. Our Kohl's stores generally carry a consistent merchandise assortment with some differences attributable to local preferences. Our website includes merchandise which is available in our stores, as well as merchandise that is available only online.

Sales increased 2.2% to $19.1 billion for 2017. We saw consistent improvement during the year in sales trends which culminated in a 6.3% increase in our 4th quarter comparable sales and contributed to a 1.5% increase in our comparable sales for the year.

Gross margin as a percentage of sales increased 15 basis points as effective inventory management contributed to fewer permanent and promotional markdowns. These increases were partially offset by higher shipping costs caused by online sales growth.

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") as a percentage of sales decreased 11 basis points as all areas effectively managed their expenses consistent with improving sales trends throughout the year.

For the year, net income on a GAAP basis was $859 million, or $5.12 per diluted share.

Tax reform and a favorable state tax settlement reduced our 2017 tax expense by $156 million and increased our diluted earnings per share by $0.93. The 53rd week in the 2017 retail calendar increased our diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.10.

Excluding the tax benefits, our net income was $703 million and our diluted earnings per share were $4.19, an increase of 11% over 2016, excluding $0.65 per diluted share of impairment, store closing and other costs in 2016.

See "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional details about our financial results, how we define comparable sales, the impact of the 53rd week and tax reform and the state tax settlement in 2017, and the impairment, store closing and other costs in 2016.

2018 Outlook

Our current expectations for 2018 are as follows:

-------------------------------------------- --------------------------
Net sales Decrease (1) - Increase 1%
Comparable sales Increase 0 - 2%
Gross margin as a percent of sales Increase 5 - 10 bps
Selling, general and administrative expenses Increase 1 - 2%
Depreciation and amortization $960 million
Interest expense, net $280 million
Effective tax rate 24 - 25%
Earnings per diluted share $4.95 - $5.45
Capital expenditures $700 million
Share repurchases $300 - $400 million

This guidance excludes the impact of the new revenue recognition standard which we are required to adopt in 2018.  For additional details on the standard, see Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results of Operations

53rd Week

The retail calendar for fiscal January 2018 included a fifth week, resulting in a 14-week fiscal fourth quarter and a 53-week year. During this 53rd week, net sales were approximately $170 million; selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $30 million; and interest was approximately $3 million. The 53rd week increased our net income by approximately $15 million and our diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.10 for the year.  Our comparable sales in 2017 exclude the impact of the 53rd week and compare the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2018 to the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2017.

Net Sales

As an omnichannel retailer, it is often difficult to distinguish between a "store" sale and a "digital" sale. Below is a list of some omnichannel examples:

 • Digital customers can chose to have most online orders either shipped to their home or picked up in any of our stores.

 • Approximately 75% of our digital customers also shop in our stores.

 • Digital orders may be shipped from a dedicated E-Commerce fulfillment center, a store, a retail distribution center, direct ship vendors or any combination of the above.

 • Stores increase digital sales by providing customers opportunities to view, touch and/or try on physical merchandise before ordering online.

 • Online purchases can easily be returned in our stores.

 • Kohl's Cash coupons and Yes2You rewards can be redeemed online or in store regardless of where they were earned.

 • In-store customers can order from online kiosks in our stores.

 • Customers who utilize our mobile app while in the store may receive mobile coupons to use when they check out.

Because we do not have a clear distinction between "store" sales and "digital" sales, we do not report them separately.

Kohl’s store sales are included in comparable sales after the store has been open for 12 full months.  Digital sales and sales at remodeled and relocated Kohl’s stores are included in comparable sales, unless square footage has changed by more than 10%.

The following table summarizes net sales dollars and changes in comparable sales:

Table of Contents

2017 compared to 2016

Net sales increased $409 million, or 2.2%, to $19.1 billion for 2017.  Approximately $170 million of the increase was due to the 53rd week in the fiscal 2017 calendar.  The remaining increase was primarily due to a 1.5% increase in comparable sales.  The increase in comparable sales reflects higher average transaction values as increases in selling prices were only partially offset by decreases in units per transaction.  During the year, number of transactions improved sequentially each quarter and increased in the fourth quarter, but were slightly negative for the full year.

By line of business, Home and Footwear were the strongest categories.  Men’s also outperformed the Company average.  Accessories and Kids also reported higher comparable sales.  Comparable sales trends in the Women’s business improved each quarter, but sales decreased for the year.

Geographically, all regions reported higher sales in 2017.

2016 compared to 2015

Net sales decreased $518 million, or 2.7%, to $18.7 billion for 2016.  The decrease was primarily due to a 2.4% decrease in comparable sales.  The lower comparable sales were due to fewer transactions, partially offset by higher average transaction values due to increases in both selling prices and units per transaction.

By line of business, Footwear and Men’s were the strongest categories.  All other categories underperformed the Company average.

From a regional perspective, the West, Southeast, and Midwest outperformed the Company average and the South Central, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast underperformed.

Gross Margin

Gross margin includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping and handling expenses of digital sales; terms cash discount; and depreciation of product development facilities and equipment. Our gross margin may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center and buying costs in selling, general and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold.

Gross margin as a percent of sales increased 15 bps in 2017.  The increase was driven by inventory management and less promotional and permanent markdowns, slightly offset by higher shipping costs.

Gross margin as a percentage of sales in 2016 was consistent with 2015 as higher merchandise margin was substantially offset by higher shipping costs.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”) include compensation and benefit costs (including stores, headquarters, buying and merchandising and distribution centers); occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution and corporate facilities; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores and among distribution and retail facilities; marketing expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; net revenues from our Kohl’s credit card operations; and other administrative revenues and expenses. We do not include depreciation and amortization in SG&A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry.

Many of our expenses, including store payroll and distribution costs, are variable in nature. These costs generally increase as sales increase and decrease as sales decrease. We measure both the change in these variable expenses and the expense as a percent of sales. If the expense as a percent of sales decreased from the prior year, the expense "leveraged" and indicates that the expense was well-managed or effectively generated additional sales. If the expense as a percent of sales increased over the prior year, the expense "deleveraged" and indicates that sales growth was less than expense growth.

The following graph summarizes the increases and (decreases) in SG&A by expense type from 2016 to 2017 (Dollars in Millions):

SG&A increased $77 million, or 2%, to $4.5 billion for 2017.  Approximately $30 million of the increase was due to the 53rd week in the fiscal 2017 calendar.  As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased, or leveraged, by 11 basis points.

The increase in corporate expenses reflects higher technology spend as we migrate to the cloud and higher incentive compensation as a result of our strong financial performance in 2017.

Distribution costs, which exclude payroll related to online originated orders that were shipped from our stores, were $303 million for 2017, $23 million higher than 2016.  The increase was due to growth in digital sales and the opening of our fifth E-Commerce facility.

In our stores, decreases in controllable expenses were substantially offset by higher store payroll due to on-going wage pressure and omnichannel support of ship-from-store and buy online, pick-up in store operations.

Earnings from our credit card operations, net of servicing and other credit-related expenses, were $496 million in 2017, $12 million higher than 2016.  The increase is due to lower marketing and operating costs.

Marketing costs, excluding credit card costs, reflect efficiencies in our non-customer facing spend and the benefit of not repeating a non-productive marketing event.

Table of Contents

The following graph summarizes the increases and (decreases) in SG&A by expense type from 2015 to 2016 (Dollars in Millions):

SG&A decreased $17 million to $4.4 billion for 2016.  As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased, or deleveraged, by 55 basis points in 2016.

Marketing costs, excluding credit card costs, reflect higher digital media spending.

Distribution costs, which exclude payroll related to online originated orders that were shipped from our stores, were $280 million for 2016, $2 million higher than 2015. Increases due to higher fulfillment costs resulting from our growing digital business were partially offset by lower store distribution costs.

The decrease in corporate expenses reflects higher technology spending which was more than offset by expense management in other corporate areas.

The decrease in store expenses includes reductions in store controllable expense, partially offset by higher store payroll due to on-going wage pressure and omnichannel support of ship-from-store and buy online, pick-up in store operations.

Earnings from our credit card operations, net of servicing and other credit-related expenses, were $484 million in 2016, $28 million higher than 2015.  The increase is due to higher finance charges and late fees due to growth in the portfolio. Additionally, lower marketing costs were partially offset by higher servicing costs.

Other Expenses

(Dollars in Millions) 2017 2016 2015
------------------------------------------ ---- --- ---- - --- ---- - ---
Depreciation and amortization $ 991 $ 938 $ 934
Interest expense, net 299 308 327
Impairments, store closing and other costs — 186 —
Loss on extinguishment of debt — — 169

The increase in depreciation and amortization from 2016 to 2017 includes a $22 million write-off of information technology (“IT”) projects that no longer fit into our strategic and cloud migration plans.  The increase was also driven by the opening of our fifth E-commerce fulfillment center and other IT investments. The increase from 2015 to 2016 reflected higher IT amortization which was partially offset by lower store depreciation due to maturing of our stores and store closures.

The decreases in net interest expense in both periods were due to lower interest on capital leases as the portfolio matures. Also contributing to the decreases were higher interest income due to higher yields and investment balances in 2017 and favorable interest rates achieved during our $1.1 billion debt refinancing in 2015.

Impairments, store closing and other costs includes the following costs related to closing 18 stores in 2016 and the organizational realignment at our corporate office:

Total $ 186

During 2015, we completed a cash tender offer and redemption for $1,085 million of senior unsecured debt. We recognized a $169 million loss on extinguishment of debt which included a $163 million bond tender premium paid to holders of the debt and a $6 million non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts associated with the extinguished debt.

Income Taxes

Provision for income taxes $ 258 $ 319 $ 384
Effective tax rate 23.1 % 36.5 % 36.3 %

On December 22, 2017 the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (“the Act”) was signed into law.  The Act contains several key tax provisions including the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and a variety of other changes including the acceleration of certain business asset expenses and reductions in the amount of executive pay that could qualify as a tax deduction.

Accounting standards require us to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment.  However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118, which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period.

We have calculated our best estimate of the impact of the Act on our 2017 income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing.  For 2017, the reduction in the tax rate is prorated, resulting in a current year statutory federal tax rate of 33.7%.  In 2017, we recorded a total tax benefit of $136 million related to the current year federal tax rate reduction and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as a $20 million benefit from the settlement of a significant state tax dispute.

We believe adjusted results are useful because they provide enhanced visibility into our results for the periods excluding the impact of infrequent items such as the tax settlement and federal reform in 2017, impairments, store closing and other costs in 2016, and the loss on extinguishment of debt in 2015.  However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace GAAP measures.

Inflation

Although we expect that our operations will be influenced by general economic conditions, including food, fuel and energy prices, and by costs to source our merchandise, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not be impacted by such factors in the future.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following table presents our primary cash requirements and sources of funds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cash Requirements Sources of Funds
• Operational needs, including salaries, rent, taxes and other costs of running our business • Capital expenditures • Inventory (seasonal and new store) • Share repurchases • Dividend payments • Cash flow from operations • Short-term trade credit, in the form of extended payment terms • Line of credit under our revolving credit facility

Our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the November and December holiday selling season.

The following table includes cash balances and changes.

 Free cash flow $ 881 $ 1,269 $ 681

(a)Non-GAAP financial measure

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operations decreased $462 million to $1.7 billion in 2017.  The decrease was primarily attributable to changes in accounts payable.

Net cash provided by operations increased $669 million to $2.2 billion in 2016.  The increase is primarily due to reductions in inventory and increased accounts payable.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $107 million to $649 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the completion of the beauty rollout, corporate improvements, and new stores in 2016.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $75 million to $756 million in 2016, primarily due to higher spending for our fifth E-Commerce fulfillment center.

23

Table of Contents

The following chart summarizes expected and actual capital expenditures by major category as a percentage of total capital expenditures:

We expect total capital expenditures of approximately $700 million in fiscal 2018. The actual amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on the number and timing of new stores and refreshes; expansion and renovations to distribution centers; the mix of owned, leased or acquired stores; and IT and corporate spending.  We do not anticipate that our capital expenditures will be limited by any restrictive covenants in our financing agreements.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $222 million to $808 million in 2017, primarily due to a $251 million decrease in treasury stock purchases. Share repurchases are discretionary in nature. The timing and amount of repurchases is based upon available cash balances, our stock price and other factors.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased $473 million to $1.0 billion in 2016, primarily due to a $444 million decrease in treasury stock purchases.

During 2015, we completed a cash tender offer and redemption for $1.1 billion of our higher coupon senior unsecured debt and issued $650 million of 4.25% notes due in July 2025 and $450 million of 5.55% notes due in July 2045. Both notes include semi-annual, interest-only payments that began in January 17, 2016. Proceeds of the issuances and cash on hand were used to pay the principal, premium and accrued interest of the acquired and redeemed debt.

We may again seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved could be material.

On November 3, 2017 we amended and restated our existing credit facility with various lenders which provides for a $1.0 billion senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility that will mature in November 2022. Among other things, the agreement includes a maximum leverage ratio financial covenant and restrictions on liens and subsidiary indebtedness.

As of February 3, 2018, our credit ratings were as follows:

-------------- ------- ----------------- -----
 Moody’s Standard & Poor’s Fitch
Long-term debt Baa2 BBB- BBB

During 2017, we paid cash dividends of $368 million as detailed in the following table:

 Amount per common share $ 0.55 $ 0.55 $ 0.55 $ 0.55

On February 28, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock of $0.61 per share, an 11% increase over our prior dividend. The dividend is payable March 28, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2018.

Free Cash Flow

We generated $881 million of free cash flow for 2017; a decrease of $388 million from 2016. As discussed above, the decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts payable. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing obligations (which generally represent landlord reimbursements of construction costs) less capital expenditures and capital lease and financing obligation payments. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and cash flow provided by operations. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations. See the key financial ratio calculations section above.

Liquidity Ratios

The following table provides additional measures of our liquidity.

 (Dollars in Millions) 2017 2016
 --------------------- ---- ----- ---- - -----
 Working capital $ 2,680 $ 2,273
 Current ratio 2.01 1.76

Liquidity measures our ability to meet short-term cash needs.  Working capital increased $407 million and our current ratio increased 25 basis points over year-end 2016 primarily due to higher cash balances.

The accounts payable as a percent of inventory ratio decreased to 35.9%, a 382 basis point reduction from the prior year ratio.

Return on Investment Ratios

The following table provides additional measures of our return on investments.

 2017 2016 2015
-------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- - ---- -
Ratio of earnings to fixed charges 3.4 2.8 3.1
Return on assets 6.4 % 4.1 % 4.7 %
Return on gross investment ("ROI") (a) 13.9 % 12.6 % 14.5 %

 (a) Non-GAAP financial measure

Changes in earnings drove changes in our return on investment ratios.   See Exhibit 12.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the calculation of our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and the key financial ratio calculations below for the return on assets and ROI calculations.

We believe that ROI is a useful financial measure in evaluating our operating performance. When analyzed in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets and compared with return on assets, it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period.  ROI is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (“EBITDAR”) divided by average gross investment. Our ROI calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. ROI should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as return on assets.

Capital Structure Ratios

The following table provides additional measures of our capital structure.

---------------------------- ---- ---- - ---- ---- -
Debt/capitalization 45.4 % 47.1 %
Adjusted debt to EBITDAR (a) 2.54 2.64

 (a) Non-GAAP financial measure

The decreases in our capital structure ratios are primarily due to higher earnings.

Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as our adjusted outstanding debt balance divided by adjusted EBITDAR.  We believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our current goals are to maintain a ratio that demonstrates our commitment to an investment grade rating and allows us to operate with an efficient capital structure for our size, growth plans and industry.  We are currently exceeding our target goal to take advantage of a favorable, low interest rate debt environment.  Our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR calculation may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as debt/capitalization. See the key financial ratio calculations section below for our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR calculation.

Our debt agreements contain various covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and a maximum permitted debt ratio. As of February 3, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance during 2018.  See the key financial ratio calculations section below for our debt covenant calculation.

 (a) Our leases typically require that we pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above. Such costs vary from period to period and totaled $182 million for 2017, $177 million for 2016 and $179 million for 2015. The lease term includes cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty.

 (b) Other includes royalties, legally binding minimum lease and interest payments for stores opening in 2018 or later, as well as payments associated with technology and marketing agreements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not provided any financial guarantees as of year-end 2017.

We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. There have been no significant changes in the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K.

Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation

We value our inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) basis using the retail inventory method (“RIM”). Under RIM, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of the inventories. The use of RIM will generally result in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories.

RIM inherently requires management judgment and estimates, such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation as

well as gross margin. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, fashion trends and weather conditions.

Inventory shrinkage is estimated as a percent of sales for the period between the last physical inventory count and the balance sheet date. Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. We generally perform an annual physical inventory count at the majority of our stores and distribution centers. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable.

Vendor Allowances

We frequently receive allowances from our vendors for discounts that we have taken in order to sell the vendor’s merchandise and/or to support gross margins earned on those sales. This markdown support generally relates to sold inventory or permanent markdowns and, accordingly, is reflected as a reduction to cost of merchandise sold. Markdown support related to merchandise that has not yet been sold is recorded in inventory.

We also receive support from vendors for marketing and other costs that we have incurred to sell the vendors’ merchandise. To the extent the reimbursements are for specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendor's products and do not exceed the costs incurred, they are recognized as a reduction of selling, general, and administrative expenses.  If these criteria are not met, the support is recorded in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold.

Insurance Reserve Estimates

We are primarily self-insured for costs related to workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. We use a third-party actuary to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. The actuary considers historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors, health care trends, and actuarial assumptions to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. Historically, our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as decisions to close a store or significant operating losses, indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually.

If our evaluations, which are performed on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset.

Identifying impaired assets and quantifying the related impairment loss, if any, requires significant estimates by management. The most significant of these estimates is the cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual store, management estimates future store performance including sales growth rates, gross margin, and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and occupancy expense. Projected cash flows must be estimated for future periods throughout the remaining life of the property, which may be as many as 40 years in the future. The accuracy of these estimates will be impacted by a number of factors including general economic conditions, changes in competitive landscape and our ability to effectively manage the operations of the store.

Other than the stores which we closed in 2016, we have not historically experienced any significant impairment of long-lived assets. Additionally, impairment of an individual building and related improvements, net of accumulated depreciation, would not generally be material to our financial results.

Store Closure Reserve

In 2016, we closed numerous leased stores prior to their scheduled lease expiration. In addition to future rent obligations, the closed store reserve includes estimates for operating and other expenses expected to be incurred over the remaining lease term, some of which extend through January 2030.

Income Taxes

We regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal and state filings by considering all relevant facts, circumstances and information available to us. If we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained, we recognize a benefit at the largest amount which we believe is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized.

Unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Also, as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse, it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable, deferred tax assets, tax reserves or income tax expense. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different.

Leases

Accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management. Application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine whether we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or whether the lease is accounted for as a capital or operating lease.

If we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or the lease is considered a capital lease, we record the property and a related financing or capital lease obligation on our balance sheet. The asset is then depreciated over its expected lease term. Rent payments for these properties are recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the financing or capital lease obligation.

If the lease is considered an operating lease, it is not recorded on our balance sheet and rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term.

The most significant estimates used by management in accounting for property leases and the impact of these estimates are as follows:

 • Expected lease term—Our expected lease term includes both contractual lease periods and cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the lease term exceeds 75% of the leased asset’s useful life. The expected lease term is also used in determining the depreciable life of the asset or the straight-line rent recognition period. Increasing the expected lease term will increase the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease and will generally result in higher rent expense for an operating lease and higher interest and depreciation expenses for a leased property recorded on our balance sheet.

 • Incremental borrowing rate—We estimate our incremental borrowing rate using treasury rates for debt with maturities comparable to the expected lease term plus our credit spread. The incremental borrowing rate is primarily used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. Increasing the incremental borrowing rate decreases the net present value of the lease payments and reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease. For leases which are recorded on our balance sheet with a related capital lease or financing

 obligation, the incremental borrowing rate is also used in allocating our rental payments between interest expense and a reduction of the outstanding obligation.

 • Fair market value of leased asset—The fair market value of leased retail property is generally estimated based on comparable market data as provided by third-party appraisers or consideration received from the landlord. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease. A lease is considered a capital lease if the net present value of the lease payments is greater than 90% of the fair market value of the property. Increasing the fair market value reduces the probability that a lease will be considered a capital lease. Fair market value is also used in determining the amount of property and related financing obligation to be recognized on our balance sheet for certain leased properties which are considered owned for accounting purposes.
