Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The purpose of this section is to discuss and analyze our consolidated financial condition, liquidity and capital resources and results of operations. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnote disclosures contained in this report and the following “Cautionary Statement for Forward-Looking Information.”

Cautionary Statement for Forward-Looking Information
Statements included in this report may contain forward-looking statements. Such statements may relate, but are not limited, to projections of revenues, income or loss, development expenditures, plans for growth and future operations, competition and regulation, as well as assumptions relating to the foregoing. Such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted or quantified. When used in this report, the words “will,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “plans,” “intends” and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results projected, forecasted, estimated or budgeted or may materially and adversely affect our actual results include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings with the SEC.
Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which are applicable only as of the date hereof. Except as may be required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Results of Operations
We focus on long-term value creation and invest in a broad variety of businesses. The mix of our business and investments change from time to time. Our investments may be reflected in our consolidated results as consolidated subsidiaries, equity investments, securities or in other ways, depending on the structure of our specific holdings. Further, as our investments span a number of industries, each may be impacted by different factors. For these reasons, our pre-tax income is not predictable or necessarily comparable from period to period.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $1,013.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This compares to $316.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $697.4 million reflects improved performance across many of Leucadia’s businesses. Jefferies pre-tax income increased $484.3 million due to record investment banking and equities revenues. National Beef’s pre-tax income grew by $78.3 million, as increased cattle availability and strong demand for beef continued to support strong margins.  Other Financial Services Businesses and Investments pre-tax income increased by $39.2 million, as Berkadia continued its strong performance and Leucadia Asset Management made a positive contribution, offset by an impairment charge of $130.2 million early in the year to revalue our equity method investment in FXCM.  Other Merchant Banking Businesses and Investments pre-tax income was higher than the previous year by $193.0 million, primarily related to the gain on the sale of Conwed.  Pre-tax income of our Corporate and Other segment was lower by $97.3 million due primarily to an increase in the fair value of a trading asset during 2016.

Jefferies
Jefferies was acquired on March 1, 2013 and is reflected in our consolidated financial statements utilizing a one month lag; Jefferies fiscal year ends on November 30th and its fiscal quarters end one month prior to our reporting periods. A summary of results of operations for Jefferies included in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands):

Jefferies comprises many business units, with many interactions and much integration among them. Business activities include the sales, trading, origination and advisory effort for various equity, fixed income, commodities, foreign exchange and advisory services.  Jefferies business, by its nature, does not produce predictable or necessarily recurring revenues or earnings. Jefferies results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets, economic conditions generally, and its own activities and positions.

28

On April 9, 2015, Jefferies entered into an agreement to transfer certain of the client activities of its Jefferies Bache business to Société Générale S.A. During the second quarter of 2016, Jefferies completed the exit of the Futures business. Net revenues globally from this business activity, which are included within Jefferies fixed income results, and expenses directly related to the Bache business, which are included within non-interest expenses, were $80.2 million and $214.8 million, respectively, in 2015. There were no meaningful revenues or expenses from the Bache business for 2016. Total expenses for 2015 include costs of $73.1 million, on a pre-tax basis, related to the exit of the Bache business. These costs consist primarily of severance, retention and benefit payments for employees, incremental amortization of outstanding restricted stock and cash awards, contract termination costs and incremental amortization expense of capitalized software expected to no longer be used subsequent to the wind-down of the business. For further information, refer to Note 30 in our consolidated financial statements.
The discussion below is presented on a detailed product and expense basis. Net revenues presented for equity and fixed income businesses include allocations of interest income and interest expense as Jefferies assesses the profitability of these businesses inclusive of the net interest revenue or expense associated with the respective sales and trading activities, which is a function of the mix of each business’s associated assets and liabilities and the related funding costs.
The following provides a summary of net revenues by source included in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

Net Revenues
Net revenues for 2017 were an annual record and reflect record investment banking revenues and record equities net revenues, partially offset by lower fixed income net revenues. The record investment banking revenues reflect record debt capital markets revenues, record advisory revenues and significantly higher equity capital markets revenues, as a result of higher transaction volumes and values throughout 2017, driven in part by Jefferies effort to continue to expand its investment banking team through promotions and new hires. The increase in equities revenues was primarily attributable to a net gain of $117.3 million recognized during 2017 from Jefferies investment in two equity positions, including KCG Holdings, Inc. ("KCG"), compared with a net loss of $17.9 million during 2016 from these two equity positions. KCG was sold for $20.00 per share in cash on July 20, 2017. The increase in equities net revenues was also due to net revenues of $90.8 million from Jefferies share of its Jefferies Finance, LLC ("Jefferies Finance") joint venture during 2017, compared with a net loss of $9.3 million during 2016. The decrease in fixed income net revenues is primarily due to lower volumes and volatility, which negatively impacted Jefferies client flow oriented fixed income businesses in the last nine months of 2017. Net revenues for 2017 included investment losses from managed funds of $4.0 million, compared with investment income from managed funds of $4.7 million during 2016.

Net revenues for 2016 were impacted by an extremely volatile bear market environment during the first three months of the year, with meaningful improvement over the rest of the year. Net revenues for the first quarter of 2016 declined $292.7 million or 49.5% in comparison to the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in total net revenues for 2016 primarily reflects lower net revenues in investment banking and equities, partially offset by increased revenues in fixed income. Net revenues for 2016 included investment income from managed funds of $4.7 million, compared with investment losses from managed funds of $23.8 million in 2015, primarily due to lower valuations in the energy and shipping sectors in 2015.
Net revenues for 2015 reflect the impact of challenging market conditions throughout the year on Jefferies fixed income business, partially offset by increased revenues in Jefferies equities business. Almost all of Jefferies fixed income credit businesses were

29

impacted by lower levels of liquidity due to the expectations of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and deterioration in the global energy and distressed markets.
Equities Net Revenues
Equities net revenues include equity commissions, equity security principal trading and investments (including Jefferies investments in KCG and from time to time, other blocks of equity securities) and net interest revenue generated by its equities sales and trading, prime services and wealth management business relating to cash equities, electronic trading, equity derivatives, convertible securities, prime brokerage, securities finance and alternative investment strategies. KCG was sold on July 20, 2017. Jefferies recognized a $93.4 million gain from its holdings of KCG in 2017 and an aggregate gain of $347.7 million over the five year life of this investment. Equities net revenues also include Jefferies share of the net earnings of its joint venture investments in Jefferies Finance and Jefferies LoanCore, LLC ("Jefferies LoanCore"), which are accounted for under the equity method. On October 31, 2017, Jefferies sold all of its membership interests in Jefferies LoanCore for approximately $173.1 million, the estimated book value at October 31, 2017. In addition, Jefferies may be entitled to additional cash consideration over the next five years in the event Jefferies LoanCore’s yearly return on equity exceeds certain thresholds.

Equities net revenues were $804.6 million for 2017 compared with $553.2 million in 2016. Equities revenue for 2017 include a net gain of $117.3 million from Jefferies investment in two equity positions, including KCG, compared with a net loss of $17.9 million in 2016 from these two equity positions.

Equities net revenues related to the core equities businesses during 2017 increased with higher revenues in Jefferies electronic trading, prime services, and Asia Pacific cash equities businesses primarily due to increased customer activity and increased trading volumes. The increase was partially offset by lower revenues in its equity options and Europe cash equities businesses, primarily due to reduced market making activities and lower equity volatility. In addition, 2016 included certain strategic investment gains from exposures to energy, volatility, financial and currency markets.

Equities commission revenues declined in Jefferies equity derivative and U.S. cash equities businesses due to reduced trading volumes and lower levels of volatility, partially offset by higher revenues in its electronic trading and Asia Pacific cash equities businesses due to increased trading volumes.

Equities net revenues during 2017 include net revenues of $90.8 million from Jefferies share of Jefferies Finance, primarily due to an increase in loan syndication activity, compared with a net loss of $9.3 million in the prior year, primarily due to the mark down of certain loans held for sale. Net revenues from Jefferies share of Jefferies LoanCore increased slightly during 2017 as compared to 2016 due to an increase in loan closings and syndications. On October 31, 2017, Jefferies sold all of its membership interests in Jefferies LoanCore for approximately $173.1 million, the estimated book value at October 31, 2017.
Total equities net revenues were $553.2 million for 2016 compared with $757.8 million in 2015. Results for 2016 includes a net loss of $17.9 million from Jefferies investment in two equity positions, including KCG, as compared to gains of $49.1 million in 2015 from these two equity positions. In addition, equities net revenues for 2015 included significant gains on additional securities positions, which were not repeated during 2016. Equities commission revenues gained slightly with improved market share across various product and client segments. Commissions in Jefferies U.S. cash equities and equity derivatives businesses held firm, while global electronic trading commissions gained from increased volumes and client market share. In Jefferies global electronic trading business, Jefferies has market leading customized algorithms in over 40 countries. European equities commissions increased due to improved market share, while commissions in Jefferies Asia Pacific cash equities business declined because of a challenging market environment. Jefferies global cash businesses were among the highest market share gainers compared with Jefferies peers and, in the U.S. and U.K., Jefferies platform remains in the top 10.
Equities trading revenues were solid across most of Jefferies equities sales and trading businesses in 2016. Trading revenues from client market making improved in Jefferies U.S. and European cash equities businesses. Equity derivatives trading revenues declined due to a difficult volatility trading climate and convertibles trading revenues declined driven by weakness in the energy sector during 2016. In addition, certain strategic investments gained from exposures to energy, volatility, financial and currency markets.
Equities net revenues during 2016 included a net loss of $9.3 million from Jefferies share of Jefferies Finance, primarily due to the mark down of certain loans held for sale during the first part of 2016, compared with net revenues of $41.4 million in 2015. Net revenues from Jefferies share of Jefferies LoanCore also decreased during 2016 as compared to 2015 due to a decrease in loan closings and syndications.

Fixed Income Net Revenues
Fixed income net revenues include commissions, principal transactions and net interest revenue generated by Jefferies fixed income sales and trading businesses from investment grade corporate bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, government and agency securities, high yield and distressed securities, bank loans, municipal bonds, emerging markets debt, foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives,
Fixed income net revenues for 2017 decreased $21.2 million as compared to 2016, primarily due to a more challenging trading environment across most products, including most credit and rates businesses. In 2017, volatility was dampened as quantitative easing continued across most markets Jefferies transacts in. This was partially offset by better risk management, addition of staff in certain businesses, and refreshed strategies in some businesses.
Net revenues in Jefferies leveraged credit business in 2017 were higher due to increased trading activities in high yield and distressed products as a result of additions to staff and repositioned risk. This was compared to relatively significant mark-to-market losses recognized in the early part of 2016. Higher revenues in its European credit and international securitized markets group businesses were due to repositioned strategies taking advantage of trading opportunities in certain industry sectors. This is compared to volatile oil prices and uncertainty as to bank liquidity in 2016, which negatively impacted revenues in this business in the prior year.

Jefferies municipal securities business performed extremely well for the greater part of the year, driven by increased client activity as new team members were added and market share expanded. Performance for the municipal securities business was partially dampened at the end of the 2017 fiscal year as the municipal bond market dislocated over concerns around the potential impacts of pending U.S. tax reform on both municipal bond issuers and investors.

Revenues in Jefferies corporates and emerging markets business declined in a maturing credit cycle as volatility and transaction spreads decreased from prior year levels, while demand for new issuances and higher yielding investments and higher levels of volatility were prevalent in 2016. Lower revenues in its global rates and U.S. securitized markets group business were due to lower levels of volatility resulting in lower transaction based revenues. In the U.S. securitized markets businesses this was partially offset by increased activity in origination businesses including collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”).

Jefferies recorded higher revenues in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to improved trading conditions across most core businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in its international rates business due to lower trading volumes. 2015 included $80.2 million of net revenues globally from the Bache business activity. There were no meaningful revenues from the Bache business during 2016, as Jefferies completed the exit of the Bache business during the second quarter of 2016. Excluding revenues from the Bache business activity, revenues increased $451.2 million.

Revenues in Jefferies leveraged credit business were strong on increased trading volumes within high yield and distressed products, as a result of an improved credit environment, as well as strategic growth in the business, compared with mark-to-market write-downs in 2015. Results in Jefferies emerging markets business during 2016 were higher as compared to 2015 due to an upgraded sales and trading team and increased levels of volatility and improved market conditions. Revenues in 2016 from Jefferies corporates businesses increased as compared to 2015 due to increased client activity and higher demand for new issuances and higher yielding investments. Jefferies securitized markets businesses were positively impacted by increased demand for spread products compared with the negative impact of market volatility as credit spreads tightened for these asset classes and expectations of future rate increases in 2015. The municipal securities business performed well during 2016 as improved trading activity was driven by market technicals compared with net outflows in 2015. Volatility during 2016 due to fluctuating expectations as to future Federal Reserve interest rate increases contributed to increased revenues in Jefferies U.S. rates business as compared to the prior year.
Investment Banking Revenues
Jefferies provides a full range of capital markets and financial advisory services to its clients across most industry sectors in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Capital markets revenues include underwriting and placement revenues related to corporate debt, municipal bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities and equity and equity-linked securities. Advisory revenues consist primarily of advisory and transaction fees generated in connection with merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions.
Total investment banking revenues were $1,764.3 million for 2017, 47.8% higher than 2016. This increase was due to strong performance across Jefferies debt capital markets, equity capital markets and advisory businesses, supported by a strong overall capital raising and merger and acquisition environment. In 2016, new issue equity and leveraged finance capital markets were virtually closed throughout January and February and remained slow throughout 2016. Capital markets revenues for 2017 increased 84.2% from 2016. Advisory revenues for 2017 increased 17.7% compared to the prior year.

31

From equity and debt capital raising activities, Jefferies generated $345.0 million and $649.2 million in revenues, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. During 2017, Jefferies completed 1,121 public and private debt financings that raised $292.1 billion in aggregate and Jefferies completed 173 public and private equity and convertible offerings that raised $59.7 billion (164 of which Jefferies acted as sole or joint bookrunner). Financial advisory revenues totaled $770.1 million, including revenues from 171 merger and acquisition transactions and 10 restructuring and recapitalization transactions with an aggregate transaction value of $180.6 billion.

Total investment banking revenues were $1,194.0 million for 2016, 17.0% lower than 2015. Lower investment banking results were attributable to lower new issue equity and leveraged finance capital markets revenues. This was primarily as a result of the capital markets slowdown, which began in the second half of 2015 and continued for much of 2016. From equity and debt capital raising activities, Jefferies generated $235.2 million and $304.6 million in revenues, respectively, for 2016, a decrease of 42.4% and 23.5%, respectively, from 2015.

Jefferies reduced capital markets activity for 2016 was partially offset by increased advisory revenues. Specifically, Jefferies advisory revenues for 2016 increased 3.5% compared to 2015, primarily through an increase in the number of merger, acquisition and restructuring transactions, including closing a record number of merger and acquisition transactions in excess of $1 billion. Jefferies investment banking results benefited both from a record fourth quarter of advisory fees in 2016, with Jefferies merger, acquisition and restructuring and recapitalization businesses showing continued momentum, and from improvement in capital markets activity, which began in the late summer of 2016, leading to an increase in new issue transaction volume.

During 2016, Jefferies completed 892 public and private debt financings that raised $188.6 billion in aggregate and Jefferies completed 129 public and private equity and convertible offerings that raised $24.4 billion (125 of which Jefferies acted as sole or joint bookrunner). Financial advisory revenues totaled $654.2 million, including revenues from 161 merger and acquisition transactions and 18 restructuring and recapitalization transactions with an aggregate transaction value of $135.2 billion.
During 2015, Jefferies generated $1,438.8 million in investment banking revenues. From equity and debt capital raising activities, Jefferies generated $408.5 million and $398.0 million in revenues, respectively, in 2015. Advisory revenues of $632.4 million for 2015 were primarily due to higher transaction volume. During 2015, Jefferies completed 1,003 public and private debt financings that raised $199.8 billion in aggregate and Jefferies completed 203 public and private equity and convertible offerings that raised $56.6 billion (183 of which Jefferies acted as sole or joint bookrunner). Financial advisory revenues totaled $632.4 million, including revenues from 158 merger and acquisition transactions and 13 restructuring and recapitalization transactions with an aggregate transaction value of $141.1 billion.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and benefits expense consists of salaries, benefits, cash bonuses, commissions, annual cash compensation awards, and the amortization of certain non-annual share-based and cash compensation awards to employees. Cash and historical share-based awards and a portion of cash awards granted to employees as part of year end compensation generally contain provisions such that employees who terminate their employment or are terminated without cause may continue to vest in their awards, so long as those awards are not forfeited as a result of other forfeiture provisions (primarily non-compete clauses) of those awards.  Accordingly, the compensation expense for a portion of awards granted at year end as part of annual compensation is recorded in the year of the award.
Included in Compensation and benefits expense is share-based amortization expense for senior executive awards granted in September 2012, February 2016 and January 2017, non-annual share-based and cash-based awards to other employees and certain year end awards that contain future service requirements for vesting, all of which are being amortized over their respective future service periods. In addition, the senior executive awards contain market and performance conditions. Compensation expense related to the amortization of share-based and cash-based awards amounted to $278.2 million, $287.3 million and $307.7 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation and benefits as a percentage of Net revenues was 57.1%, 64.8% and 59.3% for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Compensation and benefits expense directly related to Jefferies Bache business was $87.7 million for 2015 and was not meaningful for 2016. Included within Compensation and benefits expense for the Bache business for 2015 are severance, retention and related benefits costs of $38.2 million, incurred as part of decisions surrounding the exit of this business.

Non-Compensation Expenses
Non-compensation expenses include floor brokerage and clearing fees, technology and communications expense, occupancy and equipment rental expense, business development, professional services, bad debt provision, impairment charges, depreciation and amortization expense and other costs. All of these expenses, other than floor brokerage and clearing fees and depreciation and amortization expense, are included in Selling, general and other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In 2017, non-compensation expenses increased 5.0% compared to 2016. The increase in non-compensation expenses during 2017 was consistent with the increased activity associated with higher net revenues, as well as increased spending on technology. At the same time, non-compensation expenses as a percentage of Net revenues declined from 33.4% to 26.5% again demonstrating strategically the operating leverage inherent in Jefferies business. The increase in non-compensation expenses was primarily due to an increase in Floor brokerage and clearing expenses due to the mix of costs across certain equities and fixed income businesses, technology and communications expenses due to costs associated with the development of the various trading systems and projects associated with corporate support and core business infrastructures, and an increase in certain other expenses.

In 2016, non-compensation expenses decreased 9.1% compared to 2015. The decrease in 2016 was due to the exiting of the Bache business, which in 2015 generated $127.2 million of non-compensation expenses, including accelerated amortization expense of $19.7 million related to capitalized software, $11.2 million in contract termination costs and professional services costs of approximately $2.5 million in connection with Jefferies actions in exiting the Bache business. There were no meaningful non-compensation expenses related to the Bache business in 2016. This reduction in 2016 was partially offset by higher technology and communications expenses, excluding the Bache business, and higher professional services expenses, excluding the Bache business. Technology and communications expenses, excluding the Bache business, increased due to higher costs associated with the development of the various trading systems and projects associated with corporate support infrastructure. In both years, Jefferies continued to incur legal and consulting fees as part of implementing various regulatory requirements. During 2015, Jefferies also released $4.4 million in reserves related to the resolution of bankruptcy claims against Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.

National Beef’s profitability is dependent, in large part, on the spread between its cost for live cattle, the primary raw material for its business, and the value received from selling boxed beef and other products coupled with its overall volume. National Beef operates in a large and liquid commodity market and it does not have much influence over the price it pays for cattle or the selling price it receives for the products it produces. National Beef’s profitability typically fluctuates seasonally with relatively higher margins in the spring and summer months and during times of ample cattle availability. National Beef's fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the last Saturday in December. National Beef's fiscal years 2017 and 2015 consisted of 52 weeks each and its fiscal 2016 consisted of 53 weeks.
Revenues in 2017 increased 5% in comparison to 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of cattle processed. Cost of sales increased by 4% in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase is also due to an increase in the number of cattle processed. The combined effects of increased margin per head and an increase in volume led to higher profitability in 2017 as compared to 2016.

33

Revenues in 2016 decreased about 5% in comparison to 2015, due to lower average selling prices for beef and beef by-products, partially offset by an increase in the number of cattle processed. Additionally, during 2015, decreases to revenues of $52.9 million were recorded as a result of National Beef's use of derivatives in its hedging activity. For 2016, cost of sales declined 11% as compared to 2015, due to a decrease in the price of fed cattle, partially offset by an increase in volume. For 2016, the combined effects of increased margin per head and an increase in volume led to higher profitability as compared to 2015.
Lower average debt balances in 2017 and 2016 led to a 49% decline in interest expense in 2017 as compared to 2016 and a 22% decline in interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015.

Net revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively, include a $6.1 million and $65.6 million increase in a trading asset which is held at fair value. Net revenues for 2017 also include a $19.7 million realized security gain from an investment in a non-public security. Net revenues for 2015 include a realized security gain related to a recovery of $35.0 million of an investment in a non-public security that was sold and had been written off in prior years.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, corporate compensation and benefits includes incentive bonus expense of $10.1 million, $7.6 million and $17.4 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense was $20.9 million, $9.7 million and $14.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our other financial services businesses and investments include the consolidated results of Leucadia Asset Management fund managers, the returns on our investments in these funds, the consolidated results of Foursight Capital and Chrome Capital (vehicle finance), our share of the income of Berkadia, the results of our investment in FXCM and our share of the income of HomeFed.
Excluding the FXCM revenues discussed below, the net revenues in other financial services businesses and investments reflect revenues of $168.7 million, $8.6 million and $32.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The year-over-year increase in 2017 revenues as compared to 2016 primarily reflects greater returns on investments related to the Leucadia Asset Management businesses and at our 54 Madison real estate fund. The year-over-year decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily reflects losses on investments recorded at market value related to the Leucadia Asset Management businesses partially offset by growth in our vehicle finance businesses and at our 54 Madison real estate fund.

All expense categories were impacted by the growth of our Leucadia Asset Management businesses and vehicle finance businesses in 2017 and 2016 as compared to the prior years. Selling, general and other expenses for 2015 also include $21.0 million of investment banking and advisory fees paid to Jefferies in connection with our entering into the agreement with FXCM, and which Jefferies recognized in net revenues.  These intercompany fees have been eliminated in our consolidated results. Income (losses) from continuing operations before income taxes related to our Leucadia Asset Management businesses totaled $27.0 million, $(109.9) million and $(32.6) million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income (losses) from continuing operations before income taxes at our Leucadia Asset Management businesses primarily reflect the continued build out of the businesses, as well as returns on investments recorded at market value.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, income related to associated companies attributable to Berkadia was $93.8 million, $94.2 million and $78.1 million, respectively. Berkadia's results were impacted by reversals of mortgage service rights impairments of $35.9 million in 2016, and investment gains of $15.4 million in 2015, of which we then recorded our applicable share. As our share of profits from Berkadia are primarily taxed at the Leucadia level, the income discussed above is pre-tax. Income related to associated companies attributable to HomeFed was $7.7 million, $23.9 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2016 primarily reflects a reversal of HomeFed's deferred tax valuation allowance in 2016 as HomeFed concluded that it was more likely than not that they would have future taxable income sufficient to realize their net deferred tax asset.
As more fully discussed in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, on September 1, 2016, we amended the terms of our loan and associated rights. Among other changes, the amendments gave Leucadia a 50% voting interest in FXCM and we gained the ability to significantly influence FXCM through our seats on the board. As a result of the amendment, we have accounted for our equity interest in FXCM under the equity method of accounting since September 1, 2016. Net revenues include gains (losses) of $23.2 million during 2017 from our FXCM term loan and $(54.6) million and $491.3 million, respectively, during 2016 and 2015 from our FXCM term loan and related rights. This includes the component related to interest income, which is recorded within Principal transactions revenues. We also recorded income (losses), before impairment charges, related to our equity method investment in FXCM of $(47.4) million and $1.9 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively.

35

During February 2017, Global Brokerage Holdings and FXCM's U.S. subsidiary, FXCM U.S. settled complaints filed by the NFA and the CFTC against FXCM U.S. and certain of its principals relating to matters that occurred between 2010 and 2014. As part of the settlements, FXCM U.S. withdrew from business and sold FXCM U.S.'s customer accounts. FXCM also implemented a restructuring plan that included the termination of approximately 22% of its global workforce.

Based on the above February 2017 actions, we evaluated in the first quarter of 2017 whether our equity method investment was fully recoverable. We engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in estimating the fair value of FXCM. Our estimate of fair value was based on a discounted cash flow and comparable public company analysis. The result of our analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of our equity interest in FXCM was lower than our carrying value by $130.2 million. We concluded based on the above regulatory actions, FXCM's restructuring plan, investor perception and declines in the trading price of Global Brokerage, Inc.'s ("Global Brokerage") common shares and convertible debt, that the decline in fair value of our equity interest was other than temporary. As such, we impaired our equity investment in FXCM in the first quarter of 2017 by $130.2 million.
Other Merchant Banking Businesses and Investments
A summary of results for other merchant banking businesses and investments for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017 is as follows (in thousands):

Income related to associated companies 7,904 26,441 27,957
Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 250,716 $ 57,734 $ (12,066 )

Our other merchant banking operations include our ownership of HRG shares, which is accounted for at fair value and impacts our results through its mark-to-market adjustments reflected in net revenues, and the consolidated results of Vitesse and JETX (oil and gas production and development) and Conwed and Idaho Timber (manufacturing companies). It also includes our equity investments in Garcadia (automobile dealerships), Linkem (fixed wireless broadband services in Italy) and Golden Queen (a gold and silver mining project).

Net revenues include principal transactions related to unrealized gains (losses) of $64.8 million, $93.2 million and $(28.0) million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, from the change in value of our investment in HRG. We classify HRG as a trading asset for which the fair value option was elected and we reflect mark-to-market adjustments through Principal transactions revenues.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues for manufacturing were $504.5 million (including the gain on the sale of Conwed of $178.2 million, net of working capital adjustments), $415.8 million and $392.1 million, respectively.
Net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 for our oil and gas production and development businesses were $45.2 million, $53.5 million and $54.1 million, respectively. As discussed further in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, Vitesse uses swaps and call and put options in order to reduce exposure to future oil price fluctuations. Net unrealized gains (losses) of $1.8 million, $(11.8) million and $7.4 million were recorded related to these derivatives in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. JETX revenues during 2017 and 2016 were impacted by $(20.1) million and $9.6 million, respectively, of unrealized gains (losses) on a trading asset which is held at fair value.

36

The decrease in cost of sales for 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to the sale of Conwed in the first quarter of 2017.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Selling, general and other expenses for manufacturing were $2.8 million, $9.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively. Selling, general and other expenses for our oil and gas production and development businesses were $35.3 million, $109.1 million and $49.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total selling, general and other expenses decreased $91.7 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily reflecting lower costs for our oil and gas production and development businesses and the sale of Conwed in early 2017. Selling, general and other expenses for our oil and gas production and development businesses include impairment charges of $10.1 million, $63.8 million and $20.3 million recorded by JETX in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2017 impairment charge related to the write-off of the remaining Houston County acreage due to the decision made in 2017 to focus on JETX's other higher returning acreage. The 2016 impairment charge primarily related to decisions made by JETX in the third quarter to curtail development of both its southern acreage in the East Eagle Ford and its Houston County acreage. A $55.0 million impairment charge was then recorded for the difference between the carrying value of that acreage and the estimated net realizable value. The 2016 impairment also included the write-down of certain JETX leases that would not benefit its business going forward. The 2015 impairment charge related to the write-down of JETX oil field assets in Houston County to fair value.
Depreciation and amortization for the oil and gas production and development businesses were $29.9 million, $30.4 million and $25.1 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The significant increase in 2017 and 2016 is due to increased production and additional wells compared to 2015.
Income related to associated companies primarily relates to our investments in Garcadia and Linkem. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, income related to Garcadia was $48.2 million, $52.3 million and $53.2 million, respectively, and losses related to Linkem were $32.6 million, $22.9 million and $15.6 million, respectively.
Pre-tax income for 2017 includes $208.0 million from manufacturing, including the gain on the sale of Conwed of $178.2 million (including working capital adjustments), $7.9 million of income related to associated companies and $64.8 million related to our investment in HRG, offset partially by pre-tax losses from the oil and gas production and development businesses of $26.0 million. Pre-tax income for 2016 includes $93.2 million related to our investment in HRG, $39.8 million from manufacturing and $26.4 million of income related to associated companies, offset by pre-tax losses for the oil and gas production and development businesses of $90.8 million. Pre-tax losses for 2015 includes losses of $28.0 million related to our investment in HRG and pre-tax losses for the oil and gas production and development businesses of $31.9 million, partially offset by $31.1 million of income from manufacturing and $28.0 million of income related to associated companies.
Parent Company Interest
Parent company interest totaled $58.9 million, $58.9 million and $87.2 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decline in interest expense in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to the repayment of our 8.125% Senior Notes in September 2015.
Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted. The Tax Act is one of the most comprehensive changes in the U.S. corporate income tax since 1986 and certain provisions are complex in their application. The Tax Act revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, adopting a territorial income tax system, and imposing a transition tax on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In connection with our initial analysis, we have recorded a discrete tax expense of $450.5 million as a provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Act during 2017. This provisional estimate primarily consists of a $415.0 million expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset and a $35.5 million expense related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our provision for income taxes was $761.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of about 75%. Our 2017 provision was impacted by a non-cash $450.5 million charge related to the impact of tax reform. This charge increased our effective rate by 44%. Additionally, our 2017 provision was reduced by a $31.9 million benefit resulting from the repatriation of Jefferies earnings from certain of its foreign subsidiaries, along with their associated foreign tax credits. This benefit reduced our effective tax rate for 2017 by approximately 3%.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our provision for income taxes was $122.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of about 39%. Our 2016 provision was increased by a $24.9 million charge related to previously issued stock awards, which increased our effective rate by 8%. The majority of the awards expired unexercised during the first quarter of 2016. The tax deductions associated with the remainder of the awards was less than the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes.

37

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our provision for income taxes was $109.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of about 31%. Our 2015 provision was reduced by $10.7 million, lowering our effective rate by 3%, related to benefits recorded for certain state and local net operating loss carryforwards, which are more likely than not to be realized in the future.
Discontinued Operations
Our gain on disposal from discontinued operations, net of tax totaled $5.1 million in 2015. This gain primarily relates to additional consideration received related to the 2012 sale of our small Caribbean-based telecommunications provider and a reversal of a legal reserve.
For further information, see Note 28 to our consolidated financial statements.

Selected Balance Sheet Data

In addition to preparing our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we also review the tangible capital associated with each of our businesses and investments, which is a non-GAAP presentation and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP presentations used by other companies. We believe that this information is useful to investors as it allows them to view our businesses and investments through the eyes of management while facilitating a comparison across historical periods. We define tangible capital as Total Leucadia National Corporation shareholders' equity less Intangible assets, net and goodwill.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Corporate Liquidity
We are a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock or membership interests of our subsidiary businesses, cash and cash equivalents and other noncontrolling investments in debt and equity securities. We continuously evaluate the retention and disposition of our existing operations and investments and investigate possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible.
Our principal sources of funds are distributions from subsidiaries, proceeds from divestitures of existing businesses and investments, repayment of subsidiary advances, available cash resources, liquid investments, funds distributed from subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, public and private capital market transactions, and management and other fees.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received $553.0 million of distributions from our existing subsidiary businesses, including $337.7 million from National Beef. We also received $463.7 million from divestitures and repayments of advances, including $289.8 million from the sale of 100% of Conwed and $92.8 million of principal repayments from FXCM.

41

Our available cash resources and investments that are easily convertible into cash within a relatively short period of time total $1,325.4 million at December 31, 2017, and are primarily comprised of cash, short-term bonds and notes of the U.S. Government and its agencies, and other publicly traded debt and equity securities. These are classified on our balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents, trading assets, available for sale securities, receivables and investments in managed funds.
Our short-term recurring cash requirements, which are principally the payment of interest on our debt, dividends and corporate cash overhead expenses, totaled $247.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Dividends paid during 2017 of $117.4 million include quarterly dividends of $0.0625 per share for each of the first two quarters and $0.10 per share for each of the last two quarters. The payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends upon general business conditions, legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. Our recurring cash requirements typically do not include significant amounts for tax payments, as we have federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and other tax attributes which offset federal tax liabilities. During 2017, we used about $700 million of our NOLs to offset taxable income, and we have about $2.3 billion remaining NOLs as of December 31, 2017.
Our primary long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on the parent company’s long-term debt ($1.0 billion principal outstanding as of December 31, 2017), of which $750.0 million is due in 2023 and $250.0 million in 2043.
We continue to use our available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, additional contributions to existing businesses, and from time to time, repurchases of our outstanding common shares. The timing of these events is influenced by many factors and therefore cannot be predicted.
During 2017, we bought 797,897 additional common shares of HomeFed for $31.9 million in privately-negotiated transactions, and participated in a preferred equity financing for Linkem, of which Leucadia’s share was $32.0 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased a total of 4,023,726 of our common shares for $100.5 million at an average price per share of $24.97. The Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to 25,000,000 common shares, which may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. As of December 31, 2017, 12,500,000 common shares remain authorized for repurchase.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized, from time to time, the purchase of our outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, depend upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors; such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice.
Looking forward to 2018, we anticipate an increase in our parent company liquidity. On January 11, 2018, the Board of Directors of Jefferies approved both a distribution of $200 million to Leucadia, which was received on January 31, 2018, and a policy authorizing Jefferies to pay a quarterly distribution to Leucadia equal to 50% of its net earnings. In addition to these distributions, we anticipate receiving payments under the tax sharing agreement between Jefferies and Leucadia. Because of the inherent difficulty in estimating future earnings and future taxable income, it is difficult to project the amounts we will ultimately receive.
Concentration, Liquidity and Leverage Targets
From time to time in the past, we have accessed public and private credit markets and raised capital in underwritten bond financings. The funds raised have been used by us for general corporate purposes, including for our existing businesses and new investment opportunities. In addition, the ratings of Leucadia are a factor considered by rating agencies that rate the debt of our subsidiary companies, including Jefferies, whose access to external financing is important to its day to day operations. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies, subject to change at any time, are as follows:

------------------------- ------ -------------------

 Rating Outlook
Moody’s Investors Service Ba1 Rating Under Review
Standard and Poor’s BBB- Stable
Fitch Ratings BBB Stable

We target specific concentration, leverage and liquidity principles, expressed in the form of certain ratios and percentages, although there is no legal requirement to do so.
Concentration Target: As a diversification measure, we limit cash investments such that our single largest investment does not exceed 20% of equity excluding Jefferies, and that our next largest investment does not exceed 10% of equity excluding Jefferies, in each case measured at the time the investment was made. National Beef is our largest investment and HRG is our next largest investment. There were no investments made during the year that approached 10% of equity excluding Jefferies.

42

Liquidity Target: We hold a liquidity reserve calculated as a minimum of twenty-four months of holding company expenses (excluding non-cash components), parent company interest and dividends. Maturities of parent company debt within the upcoming year are also included in the target; however, our next maturity is during 2023 so there is no current inclusion.

-------------------------------------- ----------------- ---------

 December 31, 2017
Liquidity reserve (in thousands):
Minimum reserve under liquidity target $ 544,600
Actual liquidity $ 1,325,384

Leverage Target: We target a maximum parent debt to stressed equity ratio of .50, with stressed equity defined as equity (excluding Jefferies) assuming the loss of our two largest investments.

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
As discussed above, we have historically relied on our available liquidity to meet short-term and long-term needs, and to make acquisitions of new businesses and investments.  Except as otherwise disclosed herein, our operating businesses do not generally require significant funds to support their operating activities, and we do not depend on positive cash flow from our operating segments to meet our liquidity needs.  The mix of our operating businesses and investments can change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures, the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a significant impact on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in any one period.  Further, the timing and amounts of distributions from investments in associated companies may be outside our control.  As a result, reported cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend, and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period.
Net cash of $1,072.8 million and $608.8 million, respectively, was provided by operating activities in 2017 and 2016 and net cash of $761.8 million was used for operating activities in 2015.

Amounts related to our U.S. pension obligations ($60.5 million) are not included in the above table as the timing of payments is uncertain; however, we do expect to make $8.9 million of contributions to these plans in 2018. For further information, see Note 19 in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments, if any, is uncertain. Such amounts aggregated $226.4 million at December 31, 2017; for more information, see Note 20 in our consolidated financial statements.
Our U.S. pension obligations relate to frozen defined benefit pension plans, principally the defined benefit plan of WilTel Communications Group, LLC, our former telecommunications subsidiary. When we sold WilTel in 2005, its defined benefit pension plan was not transferred in connection with the sale. At December 31, 2017, we had recorded a liability of $52.8 million in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition for WilTel’s unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligation. This amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to former employees of WilTel (referred to as the projected benefit obligation) and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts. Since the benefits in this plan have been frozen, future changes to the unfunded benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments, changes in the market value of plan assets, differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates.
Calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management. These assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, including assumptions about discount rates, interest credit rates

45

and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. The timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve to develop a discount rate for the WilTel plan that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% change in the discount rate would affect pension expense in 2018 by $0.2 million and the benefit obligation by $6.0 million, of which $4.4 million relates to the WilTel plan.
The deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic pension cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations ($51.3 million at December 31, 2017). These deferred amounts primarily result from differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions, including changes in discount rates and changes in interest credit rates. They are amortized to expense if they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year. The estimated net loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into pension expense in 2018 is $2.5 million.
The assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the plans, which are more fully discussed in Note 19 in our consolidated financial statements.
Jefferies Liquidity
General
The Chief Financial Officer and Global Treasurer of Jefferies are responsible for developing and implementing liquidity, funding and capital management strategies for the Jefferies businesses. These policies are determined by the nature and needs of day to day business operations, business opportunities, regulatory obligations, and liquidity requirements.
The actual levels of capital, total assets, and financial leverage are a function of a number of factors, including asset composition, business initiatives and opportunities, regulatory requirements and cost and availability of both long-term and short-term funding.  Jefferies has historically maintained a balance sheet consisting of a large portion of total assets in cash and liquid marketable securities, arising principally from traditional securities brokerage and trading activity. The liquid nature of these assets provides flexibility in financing and managing Jefferies business.
A business unit level balance sheet and cash capital analysis is prepared and reviewed with senior management on a weekly basis.  As a part of this balance sheet review process, capital is allocated to all assets and gross balance sheet limits are adjusted, as necessary. This process ensures that the allocation of capital and costs of capital are incorporated into business decisions. The goals of this process are to protect the Jefferies platform, enable the businesses to remain competitive, maintain the ability to manage capital proactively and hold businesses accountable for both balance sheet and capital usage.
Jefferies actively monitors and evaluates its financial condition and the composition of its assets and liabilities. The overall securities inventory is continually monitored by Jefferies, including the inventory turnover rate, which confirms the liquidity of overall assets. Substantially all of Jefferies trading assets and trading liabilities are valued on a daily basis and Jefferies monitors and employs balance sheet limits for its various businesses. In connection with the government and agency fixed income business and Jefferies role as a primary dealer in these markets, a sizable portion of its securities inventory is comprised of U.S. government and agency securities and other G-7 government securities. For further detail on Jefferies outstanding sovereign exposure, refer to Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk below.
At December 31, 2017, our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition includes Jefferies Level 3 trading assets that are approximately 2.1% of total trading assets.
Securities financing assets and liabilities include both financing for financial instruments trading activity, matched book transactions and mortgage finance transactions. Matched book transactions accommodate customers, as well as obtain securities for the settlement and financing of inventory positions.

The following table presents Jefferies period end balance, average balance and maximum balance at any month end within the periods presented for Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (in millions):

------------------------------------------------ --------------------------- ----- --------------------------- ------ - -----

 Year EndedDecember 31, 2017 Year EndedDecember 31, 2016
Securities purchased under agreements to resell:
Period end $ 3,690 $ 3,862

Maximum month end 7,814 7,001

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase:
Period end $ 8,661 $ 6,792
Month end average 11,273 11,410
Maximum month end 13,679 16,620

Fluctuations in the balance of Jefferies repurchase agreements from period to period and intraperiod are dependent on business activity in those periods. Additionally, the fluctuations in the balances of Jefferies securities purchased under agreements to resell over the periods presented are influenced in any given period by its clients’ balances and its clients' desires to execute collateralized financing arrangements via the repurchase market or via other financing products. Average balances and period end balances will fluctuate based on market and liquidity conditions and Jefferies considers the fluctuations intraperiod to be typical for the repurchase market.
Liquidity Management
The key objectives of Jefferies liquidity management framework are to support the successful execution of its business strategies while ensuring sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress. The liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that adequate financing may not be accessible to service financial obligations without material franchise or business impact.
The principal elements of Jefferies liquidity management framework are the Contingency Funding Plan, the Cash Capital Policy and the assessment of Maximum Liquidity Outflow.
Contingency Funding Plan. The Jefferies Contingency Funding Plan is based on a model of a potential liquidity contraction over a one year time period. This incorporates potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to, the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year and no incremental unsecured debt issuance;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maturity rolloff of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Higher margin requirements than currently exist on assets on securities financing activity, including repurchase agreements;

- --------------------------------------------------------
• Liquidity outflows related to possible credit downgrade;

- --------------------------------------
• Lower availability of secured funding;

- ------------------------
• Client cash withdrawals;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The anticipated funding of outstanding investment and loan commitments; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
• Certain accrued expenses and other liabilities and fixed costs.

Cash Capital Policy. A cash capital model is maintained that measures long-term funding sources against requirements. Sources of cash capital include equity and the noncurrent portion of long-term borrowings. Uses of cash capital include the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Illiquid assets such as equipment, goodwill, net intangible assets, exchange memberships, deferred tax assets and certain investments;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment (i.e., margin requirements); and

- ----------------------------------
• Drawdowns of unfunded commitments.

47

To ensure that Jefferies does not need to liquidate inventory in the event of a funding crisis, Jefferies seeks to maintain surplus cash capital, which is reflected in the leverage ratios Jefferies maintains. Jefferies total long-term capital of $11.2 billion at December 31, 2017 exceeded its cash capital requirements.
Maximum Liquidity Outflow. Jefferies businesses are diverse, and liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment. During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change. As a result of Jefferies policy to ensure it has sufficient funds to cover estimates of what may be needed in a liquidity crisis, Jefferies holds more cash and unencumbered securities and has greater long-term debt balances than the businesses would otherwise require. As part of this estimation process, Jefferies calculates a Maximum Liquidity Outflow that could be experienced in a liquidity crisis. Maximum Liquidity Outflow is based on a scenario that includes both market-wide stress and firm-specific stress.
Based on the sources and uses of liquidity calculated under the Maximum Liquidity Outflow scenarios Jefferies determines, based on its calculated surplus or deficit, additional long-term funding that may be needed versus funding through the repurchase financing market and considers any adjustments that may be necessary to Jefferies inventory balances and cash holdings. Jefferies has sufficient excess liquidity to meet all contingent cash outflows detailed in the Maximum Liquidity Outflow. Jefferies regularly refines its model to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and the firm’s business mix.
Sources of Liquidity
Within Jefferies, the following are financial instruments that are cash and cash equivalents or are deemed by Jefferies management to be generally readily convertible into cash, marginable or accessible for liquidity purposes within a relatively short period of time, as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition (in thousands):

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Other includes unencumbered inventory representing an estimate of the amount of additional secured financing that could be reasonably expected to be obtained from financial instruments owned that are currently not pledged after considering reasonable financing haircuts.

In addition to the cash balances and liquidity pool presented above, the majority of trading assets and liabilities are actively traded and readily marketable. Repurchase financing can be readily obtained for approximately 72.8% of Jefferies inventory at haircuts

48

of 10% or less, which reflects the liquidity of the inventory. In addition, as a matter of Jefferies policy, all of these assets have internal capital assessed, which is in addition to the funding haircuts provided in the securities finance markets. Additionally, certain of Jefferies trading assets primarily consisting of bank loans, consumer loans and investments are predominantly funded by Jefferies long-term capital. Under Jefferies cash capital policy, capital allocation levels are modeled that are more stringent than the haircuts used in the market for secured funding; and surplus capital is maintained at these more stringent levels. Jefferies continually assesses the liquidity of its inventory based on the level at which Jefferies could obtain financing in the marketplace for a given asset. Assets are considered to be liquid if financing can be obtained in the repurchase market or the securities lending market at collateral haircut levels of 10% or less. The following summarizes Jefferies trading assets by asset class that are considered to be of a liquid nature and the amount of such assets that have not been pledged as collateral as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition (in thousands):

Sources of Funding
Secured Financing
Readily available secured funding is used to finance Jefferies financial instruments inventory. The ability of Jefferies to support increases in total assets is largely a function of the ability to obtain short and intermediate term secured funding, primarily through securities financing transactions. Repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements (collectively "repos"), respectively, are used to finance a portion of long inventory and cover a portion of short inventory through pledging and borrowing securities. Approximately 74.4% of Jefferies cash and non-cash repurchase financing activities use collateral that is considered eligible collateral by central clearing corporations. Central clearing corporations are situated between participating members who borrow cash and lend securities (or vice versa); accordingly, repo participants contract with the central clearing corporation and not one another individually. Therefore, counterparty credit risk is borne by the central clearing corporation which mitigates the risk through initial margin demands and variation margin calls from repo participants. The comparatively large proportion of Jefferies total repo activity that is eligible for central clearing reflects the high quality and liquid composition of its trading inventory. For those asset classes not eligible for central clearinghouse financing, bi-lateral financings are sought on an extended term basis and the tenor of Jefferies repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements generally exceeds the expected holding period of the assets Jefferies is financing. The weighted average maturity of cash and non-cash repurchase agreements for non-clearing corporation eligible funded inventory is approximately three months.
Jefferies ability to finance inventory via central clearinghouses and bi-lateral arrangements is augmented by Jefferies ability to draw bank loans on an uncommitted basis under various banking arrangements. As of December 31, 2017, short-term borrowings

49

which must be repaid within one year or less and include bank loans and overdrafts, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and structured notes, totaled $436.2 million. Interest under the bank lines is generally at a spread over the federal funds rate. Letters of credit are used in the normal course of business mostly to satisfy various collateral requirements in favor of exchanges in lieu of depositing cash or securities. Average daily short-term borrowings for Jefferies for 2017 and 2016 were $482.4 million and $399.6 million, respectively.
Jefferies short-term borrowings include an Intraday Credit Facility, whereby the Bank of New York Mellon agrees to make revolving intraday credit advances for an aggregate committed amount of $150.0 million. The Intraday Credit Facility contains a financial covenant, which includes a minimum regulatory net capital requirement for its U.S. broker-dealer. Interest is based on the higher of the Federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% or the prime rate. At December 31, 2017, Jefferies was in compliance with all debt covenants under the Intraday Credit Facility.
In addition to the above financing arrangements, Jefferies issues notes backed by eligible collateral under a master repurchase agreement, which provides an additional financing source for its inventory (“repurchase agreement financing program”). The outstanding amount of the notes issued under the program was $722.1 million in aggregate, which is presented within Other secured financings in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017. All of the notes bear interest at a spread over one month LIBOR. Of the $722.1 million aggregate notes, $164.0 million matures in May 2018, but is currently redeemable at the option of the noteholders; $97.4 million matures in February 2018; $101.3 million matures in July 2018, but is currently redeemable at Jefferies option or the option of the noteholders; $74.4 million matures in July 2018; $125.0 million matures in August 2018, but is currently redeemable at Jefferies option or the option of the noteholders; and $160.0 million matures in November 2018, but is currently redeemable at Jefferies option.
Long-Term Debt
Jefferies long-term debt reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 is $6.4 billion.  Jefferies long-term debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately seven years. Jefferies next scheduled maturity is the $678.3 million principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes that mature in April 2018.
Jefferies long-term debt ratings are as follows:

------------------------- ------ -------

 Rating Outlook

Moody’s Investors Service Baa3 Stable
Standard and Poor’s BBB- Stable
Fitch Ratings BBB Stable

Jefferies access to external financing to finance its day to day operations, as well as the cost of that financing, is dependent upon various factors, including its debt ratings. Jefferies current debt ratings are dependent upon many factors, including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trend and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, capital structure, overall risk management, business diversification and market share and competitive position in the markets in which it operates. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact Jefferies credit ratings. While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact on its business and trading results in future periods is inherently uncertain and depends on a number of factors, including the magnitude of the downgrade, the behavior of individual clients and future mitigating action taken by Jefferies.
In connection with certain OTC derivative contract arrangements and certain other trading arrangements, Jefferies may be required to provide additional collateral to counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations in the event of a credit rating downgrade. The amount of additional collateral that could be called by counterparties, exchanges and clearing organizations under the terms of such agreements in the event of a downgrade of Jefferies long-term credit rating below investment grade was $48.5 million. For certain foreign clearing organizations, credit rating is only one of several factors employed in determining collateral that could be called. The above represents management’s best estimate for additional collateral to be called in the event of credit rating downgrade. The impact of additional collateral requirements is considered in Jefferies Contingency Funding Plan and calculation of Maximum Liquidity Outflow, as described above.
Ratings issued by credit rating agencies are subject to change at any time.

Net Capital
Jefferies operates a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and member firms of FINRA. Jefferies LLC is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission Uniform Net Capital Rule ("Rule 15c3-1"), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and has elected to calculate minimum capital requirements using the alternative method permitted by Rule 15c3-1 in calculating net capital. Jefferies, as a dually-registered U.S. broker-dealer and FCM, is also subject to Rule 1.17 of the CFTC which sets forth minimum financial requirements. The minimum net capital requirement in determining excess net capital for a dually-registered U.S. broker-dealer and FCM is equal to the greater of the requirement under Rule 15c3-1 or CFTC Rule 1.17. In November 2017, Jefferies Execution Services, Inc. merged with and into Jefferies LLC, with Jefferies LLC as the surviving entity.

Jefferies LLC’s net capital and excess net capital as of December 31, 2017 were $1,418.9 million and $1,330.2 million, respectively.
FINRA is the designated examining authority for Jefferies U.S. broker-dealer and the NFA is the designated self-regulatory organization for Jefferies as an FCM.

Certain other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries of Jefferies are subject to capital adequacy requirements as prescribed by the regulatory authorities in their respective jurisdictions, including Jefferies International Limited which is subject to the regulatory supervision and requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that require the registration of all swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and/or major security-based swap participants. While entities that register under these provisions will be subject to regulatory capital requirements, these regulatory capital requirements have not yet been finalized. Jefferies expects that these provisions will result in modifications to the regulatory capital requirements of some of its entities, and will result in some of its other entities becoming subject to regulatory capital requirements for the first time, including Jefferies Financial Services, Inc., which registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC during January 2013 and Jefferies Financial Products LLC, which registered during August 2014.
The regulatory capital requirements referred to above may restrict Jefferies ability to withdraw capital from its regulated subsidiaries. Some of our other consolidated subsidiaries also have credit agreements which may restrict the payment of cash dividends, or the ability to make loans or advances to the parent company.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As shown below, at December 31, 2017, our commitments and guarantees, substantially all of which related to Jefferies, totaled $35,235.8 million.

We have agreed to reimburse Berkshire Hathaway for up to one-half of any losses incurred under a $1.5 billion surety policy securing outstanding commercial paper issued by an affiliate of Berkadia. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion. This commitment is not included in the table above as the timing of payments, if any, is uncertain.
In the normal course of business Jefferies and certain other subsidiaries engage in other off-balance sheet arrangements, including derivative contracts. Neither derivatives’ notional amounts nor underlying instrument values are reflected as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Rather, the fair values of derivative contracts are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Trading assets – Derivative contracts or Trading liabilities – Derivative contracts as applicable.  Derivative contracts are reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and are reported on a net by counterparty basis when a legal right of offset exists under an enforceable master netting agreement. For additional information about our accounting policies and our derivative activities see Notes 2, 4 and 5 in our consolidated financial statements.
We are routinely involved with variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2017, we did not have any commitments to purchase assets from our VIEs. For additional information regarding VIEs, see Notes 7 and 9 in our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
Income Taxes – We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If in the future we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our net deferred tax asset in excess of our recorded amount, an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period. If in the future we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of its recorded net deferred tax asset, an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period. We are required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and to weigh the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required and the amount of such valuation allowance. Generally, greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment, in particular on recent historical operating results.
Our estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, about our operating businesses and investments, includes an aggregation of individual projections for each significant operating business and investment, estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and includes all future years that we estimate we will have available NOLs. As discussed further in Note 20, Federal NOLs begin to expire in 2023, with a substantial amount expiring between 2023 and 2025. We believe that our estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if our current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different than the projected amounts, further adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible. The current balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance principally reserves for NOLs of certain subsidiaries that are not available to offset income generated by other members of the consolidated tax return group.
We also record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and if so estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which could be significant to our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition or results of operations.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that will impact many areas of taxation, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax; (3) the introduction of the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (4) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (5) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income; (6) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (7) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (8) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (9) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce U.S. income tax liability; (10) limitations on NOLs generated after December 31, 2017, to 80% of taxable income; (11) requiring a one-time transition tax

52

on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years; and (12) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. SAB 118 provides a three-step process to be applied at each reporting period to account for and qualitatively disclose: (1) the effects of the change in tax law for which accounting is complete; (2) provisional amounts (or adjustments to provisional amounts) for the effects of the tax law where accounting is not complete, but that a reasonable estimate has been determined: and (3) where a reasonable estimate cannot yet be made and therefore taxes are reflected in accordance with the law prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Due to the complex nature of the Tax Act, we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act. If we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of certain elements for which our analysis is not yet complete, we recorded a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If we were not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of certain elements, we have not recorded any adjustments related to those elements and have continued accounting for them in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before the Tax Act. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to changes in interpretations and assumptions, and guidance that may be issued and actions we may take in response to the Tax Act. We note that the Tax Act is complex and we continue to assess the impact that various provisions will have on our business.

Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for the deferred tax asset remeasurements, the transition tax, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. In connection with our initial analysis, we have recorded a discrete tax expense of $450.5 million as a provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Act during 2017 increasing our effective tax rate by 44.4% to 75.1%. This provisional estimate primarily consists of a $415.0 million expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset and a $35.5 million expense related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments – Trading assets and trading liabilities are recorded at fair value, either as required by accounting pronouncements or through the fair value option election. Trading assets and trading liabilities include Jefferies trading activities and financial instruments of other consolidated entities that are accounted for through the fair value option election. Gains and losses on trading assets and trading liabilities are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Available for sale securities are reflected at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a separate component of equity, net of taxes.  When sold, realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are reflected in the caption Net realized securities gains. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).
In determining fair value, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. We apply a hierarchy to categorize our fair value measurements broken down into three levels based on the transparency of inputs as follows:
Level 1:       Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.
Level 2:       Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of these financial instruments includes cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, derivative instruments fair values for which have been derived using model inputs that are directly observable in the market, or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed.
Level 3:          Instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These financial instruments are measured using management’s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.

53

Fair value is a market based measure; therefore, when market observable inputs are not available, our judgment is applied to reflect those judgments that a market participant would use in valuing the same asset or liability. The availability of observable inputs can vary for different products. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date even in periods of market disruption or illiquidity. The valuation of financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy involves the greatest amount of management judgment.
Jefferies Independent Price Verification Group, independent of its trading function, plays an important role in determining that financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable. This is particularly important where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, these control processes include reviews of the pricing model’s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by risk management personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. In addition, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model.
We estimate the fair value of our term loan to FXCM by using valuation models with inputs including management's assumptions concerning the amount and timing of expected cash flows, the loan's implied credit rating and effective yield. We also engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in estimating the fair value of our equity interest in FXCM in the first quarter of 2017. Our estimate of fair value was based on a discounted cash flow and comparable public company analysis.
For further information on the fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, see Notes 2 and 4 in our consolidated financial statements.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets – We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management’s judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When testing for impairment, we group our long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities (or asset group). The determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.
We recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $10.1 million in 2017, $71.1 million in 2016 and $27.7 million in 2015. The 2017 charge related to the write-downs of JETX's unproved oil and gas properties. In the third quarter of 2017, JETX decided to focus on its other higher returning acreage and as a result JETX wrote off the remaining carrying value of $10.1 million for its Houston County acreage. $56.3 million of the 2016 charge related to write-downs of JETX's unproved oil and gas properties and $7.5 million related to the write-down of JETX assets held for sale to fair value. In the third quarter of 2016, JETX curtailed development of its southern acreage in the East Eagle Ford and its Houston County acreage. As a result, an impairment was recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated net realizable value of the acreage. $20.3 million of the 2015 charge related to JETX's oil and gas properties which were impacted by the decline in oil prices.
Impairment of Equity Method Investments – We evaluate equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a decrease in value which is other than temporary. We consider a variety of factors including economic conditions nationally and in their geographic areas of operation, adverse changes in the industry in which they operate, declines in business prospects, deterioration in earnings, increasing costs of operations and other relevant factors specific to the investee.  Whenever we believe conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might be significantly impaired, we obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections and impairment analyses of the investee assets. We use this information and, together with discussions with the investee’s management, evaluate if the book value of its investment exceeds its fair value, and if so and the situation is deemed other than temporary, record an impairment charge.
During 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $130.2 million related to the write-down to fair value of our equity investment in FXCM. As discussed above, we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in estimating the fair value of our equity interest in FXCM in the first quarter of 2017. Our estimate of fair value was based on a discounted cash flow and comparable public company analysis. We concluded based on the regulatory actions, FXCM's restructuring plan described further in Note 4, investor perception and declines in the trading price of Global Brokerage's common shares and convertible debt, that the decline in fair value of our equity interest was other than temporary. As such, we impaired our equity investment in FXCM.
Goodwill – We allocate the acquisition cost of consolidated businesses to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values. Significant judgments and estimates are often made by management to determine these values, and may include the use of appraisals, consideration of market quotes for similar transactions, use of discounted cash

54

flow techniques or consideration of other information we believe to be relevant. Any excess acquisition cost over the fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill, which is not amortized to expense. Substantially all of our goodwill was recognized in connection with the Jefferies acquisition.
At least annually, and more frequently if warranted, we assess whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level. In testing for goodwill impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not necessary. If we conclude otherwise, we are required to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill and allocated intangible assets. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, the goodwill for the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value then a second step is performed in order to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any, which is based on comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying value.
The fair values are based on valuation techniques that we believe market participants would use, although the valuation process requires significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The methodologies we utilize in estimating fair value include price-to-earnings and price-to-book multiples of comparable public companies and/or projected cash flows. In addition, as the fair values determined under a market approach represent a noncontrolling interest, we applied a control premium to arrive at the estimated fair value of our reporting units on a controlling basis. The estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value could have a significant effect on whether or not an impairment charge is recorded and the magnitude of such a charge. Adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods.
An independent valuation specialist was engaged to assist with the valuation process relating to Jefferies for our annual goodwill impairment test as of August 1, 2017. The results of this test indicated the fair value of Jefferies was in excess of the carrying value. However, the valuation methodology is sensitive to comparable company multiples and management's forecasts of future profitability, which comes with a level of uncertainty regarding U.S. and global economic conditions, trading volumes and equity and debt capital market transaction levels. The fair value of our reporting units, including Jefferies, is also impacted by our overall market capitalization. If the future were to differ adversely from these assumptions or there was a sustained decline in our market capitalization, the estimated fair value of Jefferies may decline and result in an impairment.
Intangible Assets – Intangible assets deemed to have finite lives are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, where the useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly, or indirectly, to our future cash flows. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. If future undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods, particularly for those with large investments in amortizable intangible assets, impairment charges would have to be recorded.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when certain events or circumstances exist indicating an assessment for impairment is necessary. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined using valuation techniques consistent with what a market participant would use. All of our indefinite-lived intangible assets were recognized in connection with the Jefferies acquisition, which consists of exchange and clearing organization membership interests and registrations. Our annual impairment testing date is as of August 1, 2017.
Compensation and Benefits – A portion of Jefferies compensation and benefits represents discretionary bonuses, which are finalized at year end. In addition to the level of net revenues, Jefferies overall compensation expense in any given year is influenced by prevailing labor markets, revenue mix, profitability, individual and business performance metrics, and use of share-based compensation programs. We believe the most appropriate way to allocate Jefferies estimated annual total compensation among interim periods is in proportion to projected net revenues earned. Consequently, during the year we accrue Jefferies compensation and benefits based on annual targeted compensation ratios, taking into account the mix of its revenues and the timing of expense recognition.
Contingencies – In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in legal and regulatory proceedings. We are also involved, from time to time, in other exams, investigations and similar reviews (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our businesses, certain of which may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other injunctions.

55

We recognize a liability for a contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, we accrue the most likely amount of such loss, and if such amount is not determinable, then we accrue the minimum in the range as the loss accrual. The determination of the outcome and loss estimates requires significant judgment on the part of management, can be highly subjective and is subject to significant change with the passage of time as more information becomes available. Estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain, in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within our power to control. We do not believe that any of our current litigation will have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity; however, if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts, the excess could be significant in relation to results of operations for that period. For further information, see Note 24 in our consolidated financial statements.

Note 30. Exit Costs Jefferies Bache. On April 9, 2015, Jefferies entered into an agreement with Société Générale S.A. (the "Agreement") to transfer certain client exchange and over-the-counter transactions associated with Jefferies Futures business for the net book value of the over-the-counter transactions, calculated in accordance with certain principles set forth in the Agreement, plus the repayment of certain margin loans in respect of certain exchange transactions. In addition, Jefferies initiated a plan to substantially exit the remaining aspects of its futures business, which was completed during the second quarter of 2016. In addition, Jefferies terminated its $750.0 million credit facility on July 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Jefferies recognized costs of $3.8 million related to the Credit Facility. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, Jefferies recorded restructuring and impairment costs as follows (in thousands): ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ------ - ------ 2016 2015 Severance costs $ 279 $ 30,327 Accelerated amortization of restricted stock and restricted cash awards 41 7,922 Accelerated amortization of capitalized software -- 19,745 Contract termination costs 1,234 11,247 Selling, general and other expenses 300 3,853 Total $ 1,854 $ 73,094 Of the above costs, $0.3 million and $28.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are of a non-cash nature.

Note 28. Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale In January 2017, we sold 100% of Conwed to Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc., (NYSE:SWM) for $295 million in cash plus potential earn-out payments in 2019, 2020 and 2021 totaling up to $40 million in cash to the extent the results of Conwed's subsidiary, Filtrexx International, exceed certain performance thresholds. At December 31, 2016, the net book value of our investment in Conwed was $100.6 million. A pre-tax gain of $178.2 million (net of working capital adjustments) was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. The sale of Conwed did not meet the GAAP criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation. Assets held for sale at December 31, 2016, which primarily relate to Conwed, are as follows (in thousands): --------------------------------------------------- ------ ------- Cash $ 5,206 Receivables 15,297 Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, net 18,664 Intangible assets, net and goodwill 56,854 Inventory 19,069 Other assets 12,993 $ 128,083 Liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2016 were $14.7 million and are included in Payables, expense accruals and other liabilities. Gain on disposal of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relates to additional consideration received related to the 2012 sale of our small Caribbean-based telecommunications provider, and a reversal of a legal reserve.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS TubeMogul On December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million of which $745.1 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $204.4 million to identifiable intangible assets and $142.0 million to net liabilities assumed. We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has n...

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Corporate Liquidity
We are a holding company whose assets principally consist of the stock or membership interests of our subsidiary businesses, cash and cash equivalents and other noncontrolling investments in debt and equity securities. We continuously evaluate the retention and disposition of our existing operations and investments and investigate possible acquisitions of new businesses in order to maximize shareholder value. Accordingly, further acquisitions, divestitures, investments and changes in capital structure are possible.
Our principal sources of funds are distributions from subsidiaries, proceeds from divestitures of existing businesses and investments, repayment of subsidiary advances, available cash resources, liquid investments, funds distributed from subsidiaries as tax sharing payments, public and private capital market transactions, and management and other fees.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received $553.0 million of distributions from our existing subsidiary businesses, including $337.7 million from National Beef. We also received $463.7 million from divestitures and repayments of advances, including $289.8 million from the sale of 100% of Conwed and $92.8 million of principal repayments from FXCM.

41

Our available cash resources and investments that are easily convertible into cash within a relatively short period of time total $1,325.4 million at December 31, 2017, and are primarily comprised of cash, short-term bonds and notes of the U.S. Government and its agencies, and other publicly traded debt and equity securities. These are classified on our balance sheet as cash and cash equivalents, trading assets, available for sale securities, receivables and investments in managed funds.
Our short-term recurring cash requirements, which are principally the payment of interest on our debt, dividends and corporate cash overhead expenses, totaled $247.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Dividends paid during 2017 of $117.4 million include quarterly dividends of $0.0625 per share for each of the first two quarters and $0.10 per share for each of the last two quarters. The payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and depends upon general business conditions, legal and contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem to be relevant. Our recurring cash requirements typically do not include significant amounts for tax payments, as we have federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and other tax attributes which offset federal tax liabilities. During 2017, we used about $700 million of our NOLs to offset taxable income, and we have about $2.3 billion remaining NOLs as of December 31, 2017.
Our primary long-term cash requirement is to make principal payments on the parent company’s long-term debt ($1.0 billion principal outstanding as of December 31, 2017), of which $750.0 million is due in 2023 and $250.0 million in 2043.
We continue to use our available liquidity to make acquisitions of new businesses and other investments, additional contributions to existing businesses, and from time to time, repurchases of our outstanding common shares. The timing of these events is influenced by many factors and therefore cannot be predicted.
During 2017, we bought 797,897 additional common shares of HomeFed for $31.9 million in privately-negotiated transactions, and participated in a preferred equity financing for Linkem, of which Leucadia’s share was $32.0 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased a total of 4,023,726 of our common shares for $100.5 million at an average price per share of $24.97. The Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to 25,000,000 common shares, which may be made from time to time in the open market, through block trades or otherwise. As of December 31, 2017, 12,500,000 common shares remain authorized for repurchase.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized, from time to time, the purchase of our outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, depend upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements and other factors; such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without notice.
Looking forward to 2018, we anticipate an increase in our parent company liquidity. On January 11, 2018, the Board of Directors of Jefferies approved both a distribution of $200 million to Leucadia, which was received on January 31, 2018, and a policy authorizing Jefferies to pay a quarterly distribution to Leucadia equal to 50% of its net earnings. In addition to these distributions, we anticipate receiving payments under the tax sharing agreement between Jefferies and Leucadia. Because of the inherent difficulty in estimating future earnings and future taxable income, it is difficult to project the amounts we will ultimately receive.
Concentration, Liquidity and Leverage Targets
From time to time in the past, we have accessed public and private credit markets and raised capital in underwritten bond financings. The funds raised have been used by us for general corporate purposes, including for our existing businesses and new investment opportunities. In addition, the ratings of Leucadia are a factor considered by rating agencies that rate the debt of our subsidiary companies, including Jefferies, whose access to external financing is important to its day to day operations. Ratings issued by bond rating agencies, subject to change at any time, are as follows:

------------------------- ------ -------------------

 Rating Outlook
Moody’s Investors Service Ba1 Rating Under Review
Standard and Poor’s BBB- Stable
Fitch Ratings BBB Stable

We target specific concentration, leverage and liquidity principles, expressed in the form of certain ratios and percentages, although there is no legal requirement to do so.
Concentration Target: As a diversification measure, we limit cash investments such that our single largest investment does not exceed 20% of equity excluding Jefferies, and that our next largest investment does not exceed 10% of equity excluding Jefferies, in each case measured at the time the investment was made. National Beef is our largest investment and HRG is our next largest investment. There were no investments made during the year that approached 10% of equity excluding Jefferies.

42

Liquidity Target: We hold a liquidity reserve calculated as a minimum of twenty-four months of holding company expenses (excluding non-cash components), parent company interest and dividends. Maturities of parent company debt within the upcoming year are also included in the target; however, our next maturity is during 2023 so there is no current inclusion.

-------------------------------------- ----------------- ---------

Liquidity reserve (in thousands):
Minimum reserve under liquidity target $ 544,600
Actual liquidity $ 1,325,384

Leverage Target: We target a maximum parent debt to stressed equity ratio of .50, with stressed equity defined as equity (excluding Jefferies) assuming the loss of our two largest investments.

[") was signed into law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions that require the registration of all swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and/or major security-based swap participants. While entities that register under these provisions will be subject to regulatory capital requirements, these regulatory capital requirements have not yet been finalized. Jefferies expects that these provisions will result in modifications to the regulatory capital requirements of some of its entities, and will result in some of its other entities becoming subject to regulatory capital requirements for the first time, including Jefferies Financial Services, Inc., which registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC during January 2013 and Jefferies Financial Products LLC, which registered during August 2014.
The regulatory capital requirements referred to above may restrict Jefferies ability to withdraw capital from its regulated subsidiaries. Some of our other consolidated subsidiaries also have credit agreements which may restrict the payment of cash dividends, or the ability to make loans or advances to the parent company.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As shown below, at December 31, 2017, our commitments and guarantees, substantially all of which related to Jefferies, totaled $35,235.8 million.

We have agreed to reimburse Berkshire Hathaway for up to one-half of any losses incurred under a $1.5 billion surety policy securing outstanding commercial paper issued by an affiliate of Berkadia. As of December 31, 2017, the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion. This commitment is not included in the table above as the timing of payments, if any, is uncertain.
In the normal course of business Jefferies and certain other subsidiaries engage in other off-balance sheet arrangements, including derivative contracts. Neither derivatives’ notional amounts nor underlying instrument values are reflected as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Rather, the fair values of derivative contracts are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Trading assets – Derivative contracts or Trading liabilities – Derivative contracts as applicable.  Derivative contracts are reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and are reported on a net by counterparty basis when a legal right of offset exists under an enforceable master netting agreement. For additional information about our accounting policies and our derivative activities see Notes 2, 4 and 5 in our consolidated financial statements.
We are routinely involved with variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2017, we did not have any commitments to purchase assets from our VIEs. For additional information regarding VIEs, see Notes 7 and 9 in our consolidated financial statements.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
Income Taxes – We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. If in the future we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our net deferred tax asset in excess of our recorded amount, an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period. If in the future we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of its recorded net deferred tax asset, an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period. We are required to consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and to weigh the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required and the amount of such valuation allowance. Generally, greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment, in particular on recent historical operating results.
Our estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, about our operating businesses and investments, includes an aggregation of individual projections for each significant operating business and investment, estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and includes all future years that we estimate we will have available NOLs. As discussed further in Note 20, Federal NOLs begin to expire in 2023, with a substantial amount expiring between 2023 and 2025. We believe that our estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain, and if our current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different than the projected amounts, further adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible. The current balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance principally reserves for NOLs of certain subsidiaries that are not available to offset income generated by other members of the consolidated tax return group.
We also record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and if so estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which could be significant to our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition or results of operations.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that will impact many areas of taxation, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax; (3) the introduction of the base erosion anti-abuse tax, a new minimum tax; (4) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (5) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income; (6) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (7) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (8) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (9) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce U.S. income tax liability; (10) limitations on NOLs generated after December 31, 2017, to 80% of taxable income; (11) requiring a one-time transition tax

on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years; and (12) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property.

On December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. SAB 118 provides a three-step process to be applied at each reporting period to account for and qualitatively disclose: (1) the effects of the change in tax law for which accounting is complete; (2) provisional amounts (or adjustments to provisional amounts) for the effects of the tax law where accounting is not complete, but that a reasonable estimate has been determined: and (3) where a reasonable estimate cannot yet be made and therefore taxes are reflected in accordance with the law prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Due to the complex nature of the Tax Act, we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act. If we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of certain elements for which our analysis is not yet complete, we recorded a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If we were not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of certain elements, we have not recorded any adjustments related to those elements and have continued accounting for them in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before the Tax Act. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, due to changes in interpretations and assumptions, and guidance that may be issued and actions we may take in response to the Tax Act. We note that the Tax Act is complex and we continue to assess the impact that various provisions will have on our business.

Since the Tax Act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months, we consider the accounting for the deferred tax asset remeasurements, the transition tax, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. In connection with our initial analysis, we have recorded a discrete tax expense of $450.5 million as a provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Act during 2017 increasing our effective tax rate by 44.4% to 75.1%. This provisional estimate primarily consists of a $415.0 million expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset and a $35.5 million expense related to the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments – Trading assets and trading liabilities are recorded at fair value, either as required by accounting pronouncements or through the fair value option election. Trading assets and trading liabilities include Jefferies trading activities and financial instruments of other consolidated entities that are accounted for through the fair value option election. Gains and losses on trading assets and trading liabilities are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Available for sale securities are reflected at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a separate component of equity, net of taxes.  When sold, realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are reflected in the caption Net realized securities gains. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price).
In determining fair value, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. We apply a hierarchy to categorize our fair value measurements broken down into three levels based on the transparency of inputs as follows:
Level 1:       Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date.
Level 2:       Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of these financial instruments includes cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, derivative instruments fair values for which have been derived using model inputs that are directly observable in the market, or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed.
Level 3:          Instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These financial instruments are measured using management’s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.

53

Fair value is a market based measure; therefore, when market observable inputs are not available, our judgment is applied to reflect those judgments that a market participant would use in valuing the same asset or liability. The availability of observable inputs can vary for different products. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date even in periods of market disruption or illiquidity. The valuation of financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy involves the greatest amount of management judgment.
Jefferies Independent Price Verification Group, independent of its trading function, plays an important role in determining that financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable. This is particularly important where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable. Where a pricing model is used to determine fair value, these control processes include reviews of the pricing model’s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by risk management personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks. In addition, recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model.
