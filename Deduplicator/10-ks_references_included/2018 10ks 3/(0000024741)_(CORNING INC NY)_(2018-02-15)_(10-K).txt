   OVERVIEW

   ﻿

   Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework

   ﻿

			In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.  The Framework outlines our leadership priorities, and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.  We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.  Under the Framework we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.

   ﻿

			Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities.  Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.  This strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.

   ﻿

   Performance against the Framework

   ﻿

			Since introducing the Framework, we have distributed $9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and increased the annual dividend by 16.1% in 2018, 14.8% in 2017 and 12.5% in 2016 as part of our ongoing commitment to return cash to our investors.

   ﻿

			We also utilized our financial strength in 2017 to continue our focus on innovation, advancing key programs across our market platforms.  Some of our achievements in 2017 included:

   ﻿

 · Celebrating a major milestone with the production of our one billionth kilometer of optical fiber. We also continued our technology leadership with the introduction of a new multi-use platform to simplify installation and reduce the costs of deploying 4G and 5G networks.

 · Shipping the world’s first Gen 10.5 glass. In addition, we captured new opportunities for Corning Iris™ Glass, which is featured in new ultra-slim, ultra-bright lines of monitors.

 · Expanding into new Corning® Gorilla® Glass applications and increasing the amount of our glass on mobile electronic devices. Additionally, the superior drop performance of Gorilla Glass 5 has enabled new smartphone designs that feature glass on both the front and back.

 · Securing an exclusive global supply agreement for gas particulate filters. We also won new customers for Gorilla Glass for Automotive, which is featured on thirty-five automotive platforms globally.

 · Launching Valor™ Glass, a revolutionary new pharmaceutical packaging solution that dramatically reduces particle contamination, breaks, and cracks. As a result, Valor helps protect patients, while increasing manufacturing throughput.

2017 Results

   ﻿

			Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2017 were $10,116 million, an increase of $726 million, or 8%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.  The increase was driven by the Optical Communications and the Specialty Materials segments, up $540 million and $279 million, respectively.  The Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments also increased, up $74 million and $40 million, respectively.  A decline in net sales of $241 million in the Display Technologies segment partially offset these increases, driven by price declines of approximately 10%.

   ﻿

			For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated a  net loss of $497 million, or $(0.66) per share, compared to net income of $3,695 million, or $3.23 per share, for 2016.  When compared to last year, the $4.2 billion decrease in net income was due to the following items (amounts presented after tax):

   ﻿

 · The absence of a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain and $105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016;

 · The impact of the passage of the 2017 Tax Act, including a provisional amount related to the one-time mandatory tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings of $1.1 billion and a provisional amount related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities of $347 million;

 · The change in the amounts recorded for tax law changes, valuation allowance adjustments and other discrete tax items in the amount of $186 million;

 · Higher research, development and engineering expenses, driven by the absence of the impact of a 2016 joint development agreement in the Display Technologies segment, as well as higher costs associated with new product launches in the Optical Communications, Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies segments; and

 · A decrease of $104 million in net income in the Display Technologies segment, primarily driven by price declines of approximately 10%, the absence of a gain of $24 million recorded in 2016 from the contingent consideration fair value adjustment and the negative impact of movements in the Japanese yen and South Korean won in the amount of $59 million.

   ﻿

   Partially offsetting these events were the following items:

   ﻿

 · A decrease in unrealized losses from our translated earnings contracts in the amount of $162 million;

 · Higher net income in the Optical Communications segment, up $96 million, driven by an 18% increase in net sales;

 · Higher net income in the Specialty Materials segment, up $75 million, driven by a 25% increase in net sales;

 · The absence of a charge of $86 million related to the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and related costs;

 · Higher equity earnings of affiliated companies, driven by an increase of $90 million in equity earnings from HSG, offset somewhat by the absence of $76 million in equity earnings from Dow Corning’s silicones business. The HSG increase was due to higher volume, which added $33 million, and an increase of approximately $78 million in settlements of long-term sales agreements, partially offset by higher restructuring and impairment charges of $17 million;

 · A decrease in restructuring, impairment and other charges, largely due to the absence of charges incurred in 2016 associated with restructuring activity and the disposal of long-lived assets; and

 · Lower acquisition-related expenses, down $48 million, driven by the absence of costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second quarter of 2016, offset slightly by several small acquisitions occurring in 2017.

   ﻿

			The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in 2017, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the year ended December 30, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

   2018 Corporate Outlook

			We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that core sales will grow to approximately $11 billion.  In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with year-over-year declines reaching mid-single digits, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns.  We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.  In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by about 10%, excluding any contribution from the pending acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers.  We expect high-single digit sales growth in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters.  We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on new model launches and the adoption of our innovations, and anticipate mid-single digit growth in the Life Sciences segment.

   ﻿

			For the year ended December 31, 2017, net sales increased by $726 million, or 8%, when compared to the same period in 2016.  The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:

   ﻿

 · A decrease of $241 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by price declines of approximately 10% and the negative impact from the weakening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $79 million, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms;

 · An increase of $540 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, up $446 million and $94 million, respectively, combined with the absence of production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software in the first quarter of 2016 and the impact of several small acquisitions completed in 2017. Strong growth in the North American market drove the increase in carrier network products;

 · An increase of $74 million in the Environmental Technologies segment, driven by higher sales of automotive products, up $42 million, due to market strength in Europe, China and Asia, and initial commercial sales of gas particulate filters. Diesel product sales increased $32 million with higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Asia;

 · An increase of $279 million in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by strong growth in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass products, combined with an increase of $42 million in advanced optics products;

 · An increase of $40 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in North America and China; and

 · An increase of $34 million in the All Other segment, driven by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses.

   ﻿

			Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2016.

   ﻿

			For the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales increased by $279 million, or 3%, when compared to the same period in 2015.  The following items drove the increase:

   ﻿

 · An increase of $152 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $370 million and a mid-single digit percentage volume increase, offset somewhat by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%;

 · An increase of $25 million in the Optical Communications segment, driven primarily by an increase of $76 million in sales of carrier products and the impact of a small acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software, which constrained our ability to manufacture product in the first half of 2016;

 · A decrease of $21 million in the Environmental Technologies segment driven by a decline of $78 million in sales of diesel products due to the weakening of the North American truck market, offset partially by an increase of $57 million in sales of light-duty substrates, driven by strength in the North American, European and Chinese markets;

 · An increase of $17 million in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by an increase in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass 5 and advanced optics products;

 · An increase of $18 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by volume growth in Europe, North America and China; and

 · An increase of $88 million in the All Other segment, driven primarily by our glass tubing business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015.

   ﻿

			In the year ended December 31, 2016, the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen, positively affected Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $330 million when compared to the same period in 2015.

   Index

In 2017,  2016 and 2015, sales in international markets accounted for 69%, 72% and 70%, respectively, of total net sales.

   ﻿

   Cost of Sales

   ﻿

			The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.

   ﻿

   Gross Margin

   ﻿

			In the year ended December 31, 2017, gross margin dollars increased by $286 million, or 8%, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 40%, when compared to the same period last year.  The increase in gross margin dollars was primarily driven by the following items:

   ﻿

 · Higher volume in the Optical Communications segment, driven by growth in North America and Europe, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses related to capacity expansion;

 · An increase in Gorilla Glass and advanced optics product volume, slightly offset by higher raw materials costs; and

 · Higher light-duty substrate demand in Europe, China and Asia, offset somewhat by lower North America demand, as well as an increase in demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Asia. Partially offsetting the increase in demand was a decline in manufacturing efficiency due to the use of higher-cost manufacturing facilities and sales of lower margin products.

   ﻿

			LCD glass price declines of approximately 10% and the negative impact of movements in the Japanese yen and South Korean won in the amount of $73 million, which primarily impacted the Display Technologies segment, partially offset the increase.

   ﻿

			In the year ended December 31, 2016, gross margin dollars increased $93 million, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 40% when compared to the same period last year.  The increase in gross margin dollars was primarily driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $266 million, an increase in manufacturing efficiency and cost reductions in our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments which added approximately $160 million, a more favorable mix of products sold in the Optical Communications segment and an increase in volume in the mid-single digit percentage in the Display Technologies segment. Display Technologies segment price declines slightly above 10% partially offset the increase.

   ﻿

   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

   ﻿

			When compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.  The decrease was due to the following items:

   ﻿

 · A decrease of $52 million in acquisition-related costs, driven by the absence of costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second quarter of 2016, offset slightly by several small acquisitions occurring in 2017;

 · A decrease of $64 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs, primarily driven by the absence of events occurring in the second quarter of 2016. In this period, we recorded litigation and other expenses related to the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an environmental matter in the amount of $98 million, offset somewhat by the gain on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation in the amount of $56 million; and

 · A decrease of $46 million in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans.

   26

   Index

   Offsetting these events were the following items:

   ﻿

 · A decrease of $32 million in gains from the contingent consideration fair value adjustment;

 · An increase of $51 million in the Optical Communications segment due to costs associated with acquisitions and growth initiatives; and

 · An increase of $24 million in the Specialty Materials segment in support of new product launches.

   ﻿

			In the year ended December 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $36 million when compared to the same period in 2015, driven primarily by the following items:

   ﻿

 · A decrease of $94 million in the loss on the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans;

 · The positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value adjustment of $43 million; and

 · The absence of $25 million of post-combination expenses incurred in 2015.

   ﻿

   Partially offsetting these events were:

   ﻿

 · An increase of $59 million in acquisition-related costs primarily related to the realignment of our equity interest in Dow Corning and an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016;

 · An increase of $49 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs, driven by the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an environmental matter in the amount of $98 million, partially offset by the gain of $56 million on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation; and

 · Higher operating expenses in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.

   ﻿

			When compared to the same period in 2015, as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1%.

   ﻿

			The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities.

   ﻿

   Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

   ﻿

			In the year ended December 31, 2017, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $118 million, or 16%, when compared to the same period last year, driven by the absence of the impact of a 2016 joint development agreement in the Display Technologies segment, as well as higher costs associated with new product launches in the Optical Communications, Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies segments, up $20 million, $11 million and $7 million, respectively.  As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased one percent when compared to the same period last year.

   ﻿

			In the year ended December 31, 2016, research, development and engineering expenses declined $27 million when compared to the same period in 2015 driven by the impact of a joint development agreement with a Display Technologies customer, offset partially by project development spending in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  As a percentage of net sales, research, development and engineering expenses remained consistent with the same period in 2015.

   ﻿

			Restructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges

   ﻿

			Corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2016 and 2015.  Additional information on restructuring and asset impairment is found in Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  A description of those charges and credits follows:

Dow Corning Corporation (1) $ 82 $ 281
Hemlock Semiconductor Group (2) $ 352 212
All other 9 (10) 18
Total equity earnings $ 361 $ 284 $ 299

   ﻿

 (1) Results include equity earnings for Dow Corning, which includes the silicones business and Hemlock Semiconductor business, through May 31, 2016, the date of the realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning.

 (2) Results include equity earnings for Hemlock Semiconductor Group beginning on June 1, 2016.

   ﻿

			On May 31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”) pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced on December 10, 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its 50% stock interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.

   ﻿

			The equity in earnings line on our income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects both the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones (Hemlock Semiconductor) businesses of Dow Corning from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2016, the closing date of the Transaction Agreement, and seven months of equity earnings from Hemlock Semiconductor Group.  Prior to the realignment of Dow Corning, equity earnings from the Hemlock Semiconductor business were reported on the equity in earnings line in Corning’s income statement, net of Dow Corning’s 35% U.S. tax.  Additionally, Corning reported its tax on equity earnings from Dow Corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a U.S. tax provision rate of 7%.  As part of the realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group was converted to a partnership.  Each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings.  Therefore, post-realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group’s equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and Corning’s tax is reported on the tax provision line.

   ﻿

			Refer to Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

   ﻿

   Income Before Income Taxes

   ﻿

			The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in 2017, did not impact Corning’s income before income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.

   ﻿

			The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively affected Corning’s income before income taxes in the year ended December 31, 2016 in the amount of $304 million when compared to 2015.  This impact was partially offset by the decrease in the realized gain from our foreign currency translation hedges related to translated earnings of $452 million.

   ﻿

   (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes

   ﻿

   Our (provision) benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (dollars in millions):

   ﻿

﻿
------------------------------------ ------------------------ ------- ---- - ------ - -----
﻿
﻿ Years ended December 31,
﻿ 2017 2016 2015
(Provision) benefit for income taxes $ (2,154) $ 3 $ (147)
Effective tax rate (benefit) 130% (0.1)% 9.9%

   ﻿

			For the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following benefits:

   ﻿

 · As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, a provisional tax expense of $1.1 billion for the one-time mandatory tax on uprepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred (the “toll charge”);

 · The result of a provisional tax expense recorded for the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities re-measured at the reduced rate of 21%; and

 · Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies.

   ﻿

			The effective income tax rate for 2016 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:

   ﻿

 · Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in U.S. income; and

 · The tax-free nature of the realignment of our equity interest in Dow Corning during the period, as well as the release of the deferred tax liability related to Corning’s tax on Dow Corning’s undistributed earnings as of the date of the transaction.

			Corning’s results for the year ending December 31, 2017 included a total $2.2 billion worldwide tax provision, inclusive of tax on normal operations and the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act.  Given the significant complexity of the 2017 Tax Act and anticipated future guidance from the U. S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) related to the 2017 Tax Act, the Securities Exchange Commission has issued its Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) to provide registrants additional time to analyze and report the effects of tax reform during the “measurement period”.  Under SAB 118, the registrant is required to record those items where ASC 740 analysis is complete; include reasonable estimates and label them as provisional where ASC 740 analysis is incomplete; and if reasonable estimates cannot be made, record items under the previous tax law.  The measurement period ends on the date the entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740 and is not to exceed 1 year.

   ﻿

			In addition to SAB 118, the FASB has issued guidance regarding how to account for tax reform as well as a proposal to reclassify stranded tax costs from AOCI to retained earnings.  Furthermore, to date, the U.S. Treasury has issued Notice 2018-07 on December 29, 2017 and Notice 2018-13 on January 19, 2018 with additional guidance on how to compute the toll charges.

   ﻿

			At December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act; however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our U.S. deferred tax balances in the amount of $347 million, the one-time toll charge of $1.1 billion and the impact on our state valuation allowances and recorded these as provisional amounts.  The initial accounting is incomplete as we need additional time and information to analyze all aspects of the newly enacted law and how it impacts our worldwide operations.  The additional information that needs to be obtained, prepared or analyzed in order to complete the accounting requirements includes receiving further guidance from the tax authorities; additional time to prepare basis calculations; post-enactment impacts, and further time to validate our assumptions.

   ﻿

			We re-measured the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%.  However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts.  The provisional amount recorded related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances was $347 million.

   ﻿

			The one-time toll charge is based on our unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred.  This charge resulted in an additional provisional tax expense amount of $1.1 billion. We have not yet completed our calculation of the toll charge.  This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of unrepatriated earnings that were previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.  Settlement of the toll charge will occur almost entirely through the use of existing foreign tax credit carryovers.

   ﻿

			Corning has not made sufficient progress on estimating the impact of tax reform on its assertion regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings so the Company will continue to follow its historic position while it continues to analyze this issue. As of December 31, 2017, Corning estimates that its unremitted foreign earnings were $16.9 billion.  While Corning is not changing its assertion at this time, the Company has distributed  approximately $2 billion in January 2018 from two of its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent of those subsidiaries.  There are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to this distribution of cash.

   ﻿

			Under its historic policy, Corning will continue to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings, with the exception of an immaterial amount of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation.  Our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient U.S. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable U.S. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.

   ﻿

			Corning’s accounting for the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete and, as a result, it has not yet elected a policy to account for the GILTI provisions.

   ﻿

   We will continue to monitor future guidance and to assess the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act.

			It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to one or more of the following events during the next twelve months: audit activity, tax payments, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various jurisdictions within which we operate.  We believe we have provided adequate contingent reserves for these events.  However, if upon conclusion of these matters, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than our current reserves, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment.

			2017 vs. 2016

			For the year ended December 31, 2017, comprehensive income decreased by $3.5 billion, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by a decrease in net income of $4.2 billion and a decrease in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans.   The significant decrease in net income was largely driven by the absence of a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain and a $105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016, combined with the impact of the passage of the 2017 Tax Act, which included a provisional toll charge of $1.1 billion and a provisional charge of $347 million as a result of the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Our unamortized actuarial gains decreased driven by a decrease in the discount rates used to value our postretirement benefit obligations.

   ﻿

			Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of $850 million (after-tax), largely driven by the weakening of foreign currencies, most significantly the South Korean won, Japanese

yen and the euro, which impacted comprehensive income in the amounts of $420 million, $164 million and $115 million, respectively.

   ﻿

			2016 vs. 2015

			For the year ended December 31, 2016, comprehensive income increased by $2,995 million when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by an increase of $2,356 million in net income, the positive impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments and an increase in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans.

   ﻿

			The decrease in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016 in the amount of $486 million (after-tax) was driven by the following items:  1) the decrease in the loss on the translation of Corning’s consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of $398 million, largely driven by the strengthening of the Japanese yen; and 2) the decrease in the loss in the translation of Corning’s equity method investments in the amount of $88 million, driven by the realignment of our ownership interests in Dow Corning.

   ﻿

			The increase in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans in the amount of $120 million (after-tax) is due to the following:  1) the decrease of $65 million related to the reclassification of actuarial gains to the income statement, largely due to higher pension asset returns; 2) an increase in actuarial losses of $3 million; and 3) a decrease of $188 million in unamortized losses related to our equity companies. The significant change was driven by the release of Dow Corning’s unamortized actuarial loss, which was included in the gain on the realignment of our ownership interests in Dow Corning.

   CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

   ﻿

			In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at core performance measures.  We believe that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.  Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for the Japanese yen and South Korean won, and uses an internally derived yen-to-dollar management rate of ¥99 and won-to-dollar management rate of ₩1,100.  The Company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.

   ﻿

			Net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen and the South Korean won, gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates.  Management’s discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items, as appropriate.  These measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”).  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.  With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not able to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen and South Korean won against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control.  As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.

   ﻿

			See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for details on core performance measures.  For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below.

Total core net sales $ 10,514 $ 9,710 $ 9,800 8% (1)%

   ﻿

			In all segments except Display Technologies, core net sales are consistent with GAAP net sales.  Because a significant portion of revenues in the Display Technologies segment are denominated in Japanese yen, this segment’s net sales are adjusted to remove the impact of translating yen into dollars.  As of January 1, 2015, we use an internally derived management rate of ¥99, which is closely aligned to our current yen-denominated hedges related to translated earnings.

   ﻿

			Core net sales increased by $804 million, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by increases in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments.   Lower core net sales in the Display Technologies segment partially offset the increase, down $162 million, or 5%, driven by LCD glass price declines of approximately 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms.

   ﻿

			Core net sales decreased by $90 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  Core net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $218 million, or 6%, in the year ended December 31, 2016, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume of a mid-single digit percentage.

   ﻿

			The translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates,  excluding the Japanese yen and South Korean won, in the year ended December 31, 2017 positively impacted core net sales in the amount of $12 million, and in the year ended December 31, 2016, negatively impacted core net sales in the amount of  $39 million.

Core Earnings

   ﻿

			2017 vs. 2016

			In the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated core earnings of $1,756 million or $1.72 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1,774 million, or $1.55 per share.  The decrease in core earnings of $18 million was driven by the following items:

   ﻿

 · The absence of equity earnings of $102 million from Dow Corning’s silicones business due to our 2016 realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning;

 · A decrease of $62 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by LCD glass price declines of approximately 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms;

 · An increase in corporate project expenses and variable compensation of $29 million and $25 million, respectively.

   ﻿

			The decline was offset by an increase in core earnings in the Optical Communications segment of $99 million, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with the absence of the production issues in the first half of 2016 related to the implementation of new software and an increase in the Specialty Materials segment of $61 million, driven by an increase in Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products.

   ﻿

			Although core net earnings decreased in the year ended December 31, 2017, core earnings per share increased $0.17 per share, driven by lower weighted average shares outstanding due to repurchases of our common stock in 2017.

   ﻿

			2016 vs. 2015

			In the year ended December 31, 2016, we generated core earnings of $1,774 million, or $1.55 per share, compared to $1,882 million, or $1.40 per share, in the year ended December 31, 2015.  The decrease was due to declines in the Display Technologies and Environmental Technologies segments.  Slightly offsetting the decline was higher core earnings in the Optical Communications segment, up $16 million, driven by higher sales volume in carrier network products, the favorable translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the Japanese yen and South Korean won, of $13 million and manufacturing efficiencies gained through cost reductions.

   ﻿

			Included in core earnings for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is net periodic pension expense in the amount of $49 million, $51 million and $62 million, respectively, which excludes the annual pension mark-to-market adjustments.  In the years ended December 31, 2017,  2016 and 2015, the mark-to-market adjustments were a pre-tax loss of $21 million, $67 million and $165 million, respectively.  Refer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

   Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

			We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.

   ﻿

   Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

   ﻿

   The following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (amounts in millions except percentages and per share amounts):

   Items Excluded from GAAP Measures

   ﻿

   Items which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at Core performance measures are as follows:

   ﻿

﻿
---- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (1) Constant-currency adjustments:
﻿ Constant-yen: Because a significant portion of Display Technologies segment revenues and manufacturing costs are denominated in Japanese yen, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings of translating yen into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-yen basis mitigates the translation impact of the Japanese yen, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts. As of January 1, 2015, we used an internally derived management rate of ¥99, which is closely aligned to our current yen portfolio of foreign currency hedges, and have recast all periods presented based on this rate in order to effectively remove the impact of changes in the Japanese yen.
﻿ Constant-won: Because a significant portion of Corning Precision Materials’ costs are denominated in South Korean won, management believes it is important to understand the impact on core earnings from translating won into dollars. Presenting results on a constant-won basis mitigates the translation impact of the South Korean won, and allows management to evaluate performance period over period, analyze underlying trends in our businesses, and establish operational goals and forecasts without the variability caused by the fluctuations caused by changes in the rate of this currency. We use an internally derived management rate of ₩1,100, which is consistent with historical prior period averages of the won.
 (2) Translation gain on Japanese yen-denominated debt: The gain on the translation of our Yen-denominated debt to U.S. dollars.
 (3) Translated earnings contract loss (gain): We have excluded the impact of the gains and losses of our translated earnings contracts for each period presented.
 (4) Acquisition-related costs: These expenses include intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs.
 (5) Discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: This represents the removal of discrete adjustments (e.g. changes in judgment about the realizability of certain deferred tax assets) as well as other non-operational tax-related adjustments.
 (6) Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: Includes amounts related to the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) asbestos litigation, significant, non-recurring adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and other legal matters.
 (7) Restructuring, impairment and other charges: This amount includes restructuring, impairment and other charges, including goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and disposal costs not classified as restructuring expense.
 (8) Equity in earnings of affiliated companies: These adjustments relate to items which do not reflect expected on-going operating results of our affiliated companies, such as restructuring, impairment and other charges and settlements under “take-or-pay” contracts.

			All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.”  This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business and new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.

   ﻿

			We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions.  We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income.  We have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Our reportable segments include non-GAAP measures which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.  For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” above.  Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

As Reported

   ﻿

			2017 vs. 2016

			Net sales decreased by $241 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by price declines of approximately 10% and the negative impact from the weakening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $79 million, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms.

   ﻿

			Net income decreased by $104 million, or 11%, driven by the following items:

   ﻿

 · The impact of price declines of approximately 10%;

 · The impact of the write-off of a net deferred tax asset of $38 million;

 · A reduction of $24 million in the gain on the fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of Corning Precision Materials; and

 · An increase of $40 million in research, development and engineering expenses, primarily driven by the absence of the impact of a 2016 joint development agreement.

   ﻿

   The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following items:

   ﻿

 · A mid-single digit percentage increase in volume;

 · Improvements in manufacturing efficiency, which added $68 million;

 · An increase of $42 million in the realized gain from our yen and won-denominated currency hedges; and

 · A decrease in asset write-off expenses of $31 million.

   ﻿

			The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted Display Technologies net income in the year ended December 31, 2017 in the amount of $59 million when compared to the same period in 2016.  This impact was partially offset by the increase in the realized gain from our translated earnings contracts in the amount of $42 million.

   ﻿

			2016 vs. 2015

			Net sales increased by $152 million, or 5%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $370 million and a mid-single digit percentage volume increase driven by growth in television screen size.  This increase was partially offset by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%.

   ﻿

			Net income decreased by $160 million, or 15%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  This decrease was driven by the following items:

   ﻿

 · The impact of price declines slightly higher than 10%;

 · A decrease of $289 million in the realized gain from our yen and won-denominated currency hedges; and

 · An increase of $44 million in asset write-off expenses.

   ﻿

   The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following items:

   ﻿

 · A mid-single digit percentage increase in volume;

 · An increase of $35 million in the gain on the fair value adjustment of the contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of Corning Precision Materials;

 · Improvements in manufacturing efficiency; and

 · A decline in operating expenses.

   ﻿

			The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted Display Technologies net income in the year ended December 31, 2016 in the amount of $213 million when compared to the same period in 2015.  This impact was more than offset by the decrease in the realized gain from our translated earnings contracts in the amount of $289 million.

   ﻿

   Core Performance

   ﻿

			2017 vs. 2016

			When compared to the same period in 2016, core net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $162 million, or 5%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, driven by the price declines described above, partially offset by the increase in volume.  Core earnings also decreased in this period, down $62 million, or 6%, driven by price declines, offset somewhat by the increase in volume.

   Index

2016 vs. 2015

			Core net sales decreased by $218 million, or 6%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by a mid-single digit percentage volume increase.  Core earnings also decreased in this period, down $69 million, or 6%, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by a mid-single digit percentage volume increase, improvements in manufacturing efficiency and a decline in operating expenses.

			The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily located in Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, three customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for a combined 62%,  65% and 62% of total segment sales in those years.  Our near-term sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products.

   ﻿

			Corning has invested to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for LCD glass substrates.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, capital spending in this segment was $795 million, $464 million and $594 million, respectively.

   ﻿

   Outlook:

			For full-year 2018, Corning expects LCD glass market growth to be in the mid-single digit percentages, similar to 2017. The company expects Corning’s volume to grow faster than the market as Corning ramps  up the world’s first Gen 10.5 fab in Hefei, China.  We expect LCD glass pricing to continue to improve, with year-over-year declines reaching mid-single digits on a percentage basis, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns in this segment.

			2017 vs. 2016

			Net sales increased by $540 million, or 18%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with the absence of production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software in the first half of 2016 and the impact of several small acquisitions completed in the 2017.  Strong growth in the North American fiber-to-the-home market drove the increase in carrier network products.

   ﻿

			Net income in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $96 million, or 39%, driven by the increase in sales described above and a decrease of $10 million in restructuring and asset write-off expenses, partially offset by capacity expansion spending and an increase in acquisition-related expenses.

   ﻿

			Movements in foreign currency exchange rates did not materially impact net sales or net income in this segment in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.

			2016 vs. 2015

			In the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales of the Optical Communications segment increased $25 million, or 1%, when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by an increase in carrier network sales.  The sales increase was driven by fiber-to-the-home products in North America, higher sales of optical fiber and the impact of an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016.  These increases were partially offset by production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software, which constrained our ability to manufacture product in the first half of 2016.  Production returned to normal levels at the end of the second quarter.  The translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates in 2016 negatively impacted Optical Communications net sales in the amount of $8 million, when compared to the same period in 2015.

   ﻿

			Net income in the Optical Communications segment increased $8 million, or 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase was driven by cost reductions and the continuation of the favorable shift toward sales of our solutions products, partially offset by the impact of the production issues described above, costs incurred related to a small acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016 and restructuring and asset write-off expenses.  Movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted net income in the amount of $12 million when compared to 2015.

   ﻿

   Core Performance

   ﻿

			2017 vs. 2016

			Core earnings increased in the year ended December 31, 2017 by $99 million, or 33%, driven by the increase in sales described above, partially offset by capacity expansion spending.

   ﻿

			2016 vs. 2015

			Core earnings increased $16 million, or 6%, in the year ended December 31, 2016, driven by higher sales of our solutions products and cost reductions, partially offset by the impact of the production issues described above.  Movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted core earnings in the amounts of $12 million when compared to 2015.

   ﻿

			The Optical Communications segment has a concentrated customer base.  In the year ended December 31, 2017, one customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 19% of total segment net sales. In the year ended December 31, 2016, one customer that individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 15% of total segment net sales.  In the year ended December 31, 2015, two customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 22% of total segment net sales.

   ﻿

   Outlook:

			Full-year 2018 Optical Communications sales are expected to increase by about 10% year over year, excluding any contribution from the pending acquisition of 3M’s Communications Markets Division.

   As Reported

   ﻿

			2017 vs. 2016

			Net sales increased $74 million, or 7% in the year ended December 31, 2017. Automotive product sales increased by $42 million, due to market strength in Europe, China and Asia, and initial commercial sales of gas particulate filters.  Diesel product sales increased $32 million with higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Asia.

			Net income in the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $6 million, or 5%, driven by expenses in support of new product launches and charges related to the disinvestment of an equity company.

   ﻿

			Movements in foreign currency exchange rates did not materially impact net sales or net income in this segment in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period in 2016.

   ﻿

			2016 vs. 2015

			Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment decreased by $21 million, or 2%, in the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by a decrease of $78 million in sales of diesel products due to the weakening of the heavy-duty diesel truck market in North America, offset partially by an increase of $57 million in light-duty substrates sales, driven by strength in the North American, European and Chinese markets.

   ﻿

			Net income decreased by $28 million, or 17%, driven by lower sales of heavy-duty diesel products and our investment in capacity for our gas particulate filters.  Movements in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales and net income in this segment in the amounts of $22 million and $8 million, respectively, in the year ended December 31, 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015.

   ﻿

   Core Performance

   ﻿

			2017 vs. 2016

			In the year ended December 31, 2017, core earnings increased by $3 million, or 2%, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by higher volume in both automotive and diesel products, offset by expenses in support of new product launches and a decline in manufacturing efficiency due to the use of higher-cost manufacturing facilities and sales of lower margin products.

   ﻿

			2016 vs. 2015

			Core earnings decreased by $25 million, or 16%, in the year ended December 31, 2016, driven by the items impacting our “As Reported” results described above.

   ﻿

			The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers.  Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers.  For 2017,  2016 and 2015, net sales to three customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment sales, accounted for 81%, 85% and 86%, respectively, of total segment sales.  While we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers, our near-term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products.

   ﻿

   Outlook:

   For 2018, Environmental Technologies sales are expected to increase by a high-single digit percentage.

   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   ﻿

   Financing and Capital Structure

   ﻿

			The following items discuss Corning’s financing and changes in capital structure during 2017 and 2016:

   ﻿

   2017

			In the third quarter of 2017, Corning issued ¥78 billion Japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 20 years. The proceeds from these notes were received in Japanese yen and immediately converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was approximately $700 million.  Payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.

   ﻿

			In the fourth quarter of 2017, Corning issued $750 million of 4.375% senior unsecured notes that mature on November 15, 2057. The net proceeds of $743 million will be used for general corporate purposes. We can redeem these notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.

   ﻿

   2016

			In the third quarter of 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $1 billion increase to our commercial paper program, raising it to $2 billion.  If needed, this program is supported by our $2 billion revolving credit facility that expires in 2019.  Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2016.

   ﻿

   Common Stock Dividends

   ﻿

			On February 3, 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a 12.5% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.135 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2016.  The Company paid four quarterly dividends of $0.135 during the year ended December 31, 2016 and paid four quarterly dividends of $0.12 during the year ended December 31, 2015.

   ﻿

			On February 1, 2017, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a 14.8% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.135 to $0.155 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2017.

   ﻿

			On February 6, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a 16.1% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.155 to $0.18 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2018.  This increase marks the seventh dividend increase since October 2011.

Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A

   ﻿

			Corning has 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A.  The Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of Corning’s common stock per one share of Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  As of December 31, 2017, the Preferred Stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered.

   ﻿

   Customer Deposits

   ﻿

			In December 2015, Corning announced that with the support of the Hefei government it will locate a Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility in the Hefei XinZhan General Pilot Zone in Anhui Province, China.  Glass substrate production from the new facility is expected to support mass production of LCD panels for large-size televisions beginning in 2018.

   ﻿

			As part of this investment, Corning and a Chinese customer have entered into a long-term supply agreement that commits the customer to the purchase of Gen 10.5 glass substrates from the Corning manufacturing facility in Hefei.  This agreement stipulates that the customer will provide a non-refundable cash deposit in the amount of approximately $400 million to Corning to secure rights to an amount of glass that is produced by Corning over the next 10 years.  Corning has collected the full amount of this deposit, adjusted for foreign exchange movements, receiving $185 million of this deposit in 2016 and $197 million in 2015.  As glass is shipped to the customer, Corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, no credit memoranda were issued.

   ﻿

   Capital Spending

   ﻿

			Capital spending totaled $1.8 billion in 2017,  an increase of approximately $700 million when compared to 2016, driven by expansions related to the Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility in China, the addition of capacity to support the new gas-particulate filters business in the Environmental Technologies segment, fiber and cable capacity in the Optical Communications segment and general business growth in the Specialty Materials segment.  We expect our 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2 billion.

Net cash used in financing activities $ (1,624) $ (5,322) $ (2,623)

   ﻿

			2017 vs. 2016

			Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $533 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period last year, driven by $501 million of unfavorable movements in working capital.  The negative impact of working capital changes was largely driven by an increase of $143 million in VAT receivables in Asia, a payment of $70 million related to our obligation under the plan of reorganization for PCC (refer to Note 2 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), an increase in accounts receivable and inventory to support growth in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.

   ﻿

			Net cash used in investing activities increased by $5.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period last year, driven by the absence of $4.8 billion of cash received in the second quarter of 2016 on the realignment of Dow Corning, coupled with an increase of $674 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansions and a decline of $92 million in liquidations of short-term investments.  A decline of $162 million in acquisition spending partially offset these events.

   Index

			Net cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $3.7 billion when compared to the same period last year, driven by lower share repurchases, down $1.8 billion, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $1.4 billion, the absence of $481 million of commercial paper repayments made in 2016 and an increase of $171 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

   ﻿

			2016 vs. 2015

			Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $292 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to 2015, driven largely by a decrease in net income excluding non-cash gains, an increase in accounts receivable in the Optical Communications and Specialty Materials segments, up $81 and $70 respectively, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities.  A decrease of $58 million in dividends received from equity affiliates, driven by the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning, also negatively impacted cash flow from operations.

   ﻿

			Net cash provided by investing activities increased substantially, up $4.3 billion,  in the year ended December 31, 2016 when compared to 2015, driven by $4.8 billion in cash received upon the realignment of Dow Corning, a decrease of $120 million in capital expenditures and a decrease of $399 million in acquisition spending, partially offset by a decrease of $452 million in realized gains on our translated earnings contracts.

   ﻿

			Net cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $2.7 billion when compared to 2015, driven by an increase of $999 million in share repurchases, the repayment of $481 million of commercial paper outstanding in 2015 and the absence of cash received from the issuance of long-term debt in the amount of $745 million in the third quarter of 2015.

   ﻿

   Defined Benefit Pension Plans

   ﻿

			We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  Our largest single pension plan is Corning’s U.S. qualified plan.  At December 31, 2017, this plan accounted for 77% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 85% of the related plans’ assets.

   ﻿

			In 2017, we made no voluntary cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $29 million to our international pension plans.  In 2016, we made voluntary cash contributions of $73 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $16 million to our international pension plans.  Although we are not subject to any mandatory contributions in 2018, we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of $105 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan and up to $27 million to our international pension plans in 2018.

   Management Assessment of Liquidity

   ﻿

			We ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with approximately $4.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents.  Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted.  We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. At December 31, 2017, approximately 79% of the consolidated amount was held outside of the United States.  In January 2018, the Company distributed approximately $2 billion from two of its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent of those subsidiaries.  There are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to this distribution of cash.

   ﻿

			To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.  We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $550 million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.  Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.

   ﻿

			Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes.  In the third quarter of 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved an increase to the allowable maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time from $1 billion to $2 billion.  Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  The Company’s $2 billion revolving credit facility is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.  Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2017.

   ﻿

   Share Repurchases

   ﻿

			During 2015, Corning repurchased 167 million shares for approximately $3.25 billion through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and open market repurchases as part of a repurchase program authorized by Corning’s Board of Directors in December 2014  (the “December 2014 Repurchase Program”) and repurchase programs authorized by Corning’s Board of Directors in July 2015 and October 2015 (the “2015 Repurchase Programs”).

			During 2016, Corning repurchased 197.1 million shares for approximately $4.2 billion through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and open market repurchases as part of the 2015 Repurchase Programs. In December 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $4 billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2016 Repurchase Program”).

   ﻿

			During 2017, Corning repurchased 84.4 million shares for approximately $2.4 billion through accelerated share repurchase agreements and open market repurchases under the 2016 Repurchase Program.

   ﻿

			Refer to Note 17  (Shareholders’ Equity) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

   ﻿

   Other

   ﻿

			We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.  We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.  We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.

   ﻿

			Our major source of funding for 2017 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, acquisitions, the asbestos litigation, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

   ﻿

			Corning also has access to a $2 billion unsecured committed revolving credit facility.  This credit facility includes a leverage ratio financial covenant.  The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%.  At December 31, 2017, our leverage using this measure was 25% and we are in compliance with the financial covenant.

   ﻿

			Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.  In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.  As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such provisions.

   ﻿

			Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity.  In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.

   ﻿

   Translated Earnings Contracts

   ﻿

			In the second quarter of 2013 and continuing throughout 2015, Corning entered into a series of zero cost average rate collars and average rate forwards to hedge the translation impact of Japanese yen on Corning’s projected 2015, 2016 and 2017 net income.  Additionally, Corning extended its foreign exchange hedging program to hedge a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period 2018 through 2022, with average rate forwards, collars and puts.  In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pre-tax net losses of $201 million and $459 million,  and in the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $113 million related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  Included in these amounts are realized gains of $268 million, $207 million and  $686 million, respectively.  The gross notional value outstanding for these instruments which hedge our exposure to the Japanese yen at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $13 billion, $14.9 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively.

			We have entered into zero-cost collars and average rate forwards to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the South Korean won and its impact on our net income.  In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pre-tax net gains of $95 million and $7 million, respectively, and the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $36 million related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  Included in these amounts are realized losses of $1 million, $7 million and $33 million, respectively.  These instruments had a gross notional value outstanding at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of $0.8 billion, $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively.

   ﻿

			We have entered into a portfolio of zero-cost collars and average rate forwards to hedge against our euro translation exposure.  In the fourth quarter of 2016, the zero-cost collars expired.  In the year ended December 31 2017 we recorded a net pre-tax loss of $40 million, and in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded net pre-tax gains of $15 million and $3 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the euro-denominated average rate instruments had a gross notional amount of $0.3 billion.

   ﻿

			In 2016, we entered into a portfolio of average rate forwards to hedge against our translation exposure resulting from movements in the Chinese yuan.  In the year ended December 31 2017, we recorded a net pre-tax gain of $27 million, and in the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a  net pre-tax loss of $11 million related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the yuan-denominated average rate forwards had a gross notional amount of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively.

   ﻿

			These derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net line of the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.

   ﻿

   Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

   ﻿

			Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.

   ﻿

			Corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts.  At the time a guarantee is issued, the Company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

   ﻿

			Refer to Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

   ﻿

			For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests.

   ﻿

			Corning has identified ten entities that qualify as a variable interest entity.  These entities are not considered to be significant to Corning’s consolidated statements of position.

   ﻿

   Corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.

   ﻿

 (1) At December 31, 2017, $39 million of the $75 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

 (2) Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations which primarily consist of raw material and energy-related take-or-pay contracts.

 (3) Capital expenditure obligations primarily reflect amounts associated with our capital expansion activities.

 (4) Total debt above is stated at maturity value, and excludes interest rate swap gains/losses and bond discounts.

 (5) The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments.

 (6) At December 31, 2017, $54 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when any of that amount will become payable.

   ﻿

   We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.

   ENVIRONMENT

   ﻿

			Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Corning had accrued approximately $38 million (undiscounted) and $43 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

   ﻿

			The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  The estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, are set forth below.

   ﻿

   Impairment of assets held for use

   ﻿

			We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  We review our long-lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present.  We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.

   ﻿

			Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.  These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.  This review considers all of the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.  Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.

   ﻿

   Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:

   ﻿

 · A significant decrease in the market price of an asset;

 · A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;

 · A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

 · An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;

 · A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and

 · A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

   ﻿

			For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  Our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level.  For the majority of our reportable segments, we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.

   ﻿

			For long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used.  Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.  This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.

   ﻿

			For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals.  We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions.  The Company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.

   Index

At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $711 million and $890 million, respectively.  The majority of these precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.  The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.  Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.

   ﻿

   Impairment of Goodwill

   ﻿

			We are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units.  We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management.

			Corning adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, on January 1, 2017, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.  The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.  An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.

			Corning has recorded goodwill in the Display Technologies, Optical Communications, Specialty Materials, Life Sciences and All Other operating segments.  On a quarterly basis, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired, management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit within these operating segments to determine if there have been any triggering events.  We also perform a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.  We use this calculation as quantitative validation of the qualitative process; this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review.

   ﻿

   The following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount:

   ﻿

 · Macroeconomic conditions, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and/or other developments in equity and credit markets;

 · Market capital in relation to book value;

 · Industry and market considerations, such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing;

 · Cost factors, such as an increase in raw materials, labor or other costs;

 · Overall financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue;

 · Other relevant entity-specific events, such as material changes in management or key personnel; and

 · Events affecting a reporting unit, such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions.

   ﻿

   The examples noted above are not all-inclusive, and the Company will consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.

   ﻿

			Our goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process.  This process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows.  Our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.    If the fair value is less than the carrying value, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the fair value and carrying value.

   ﻿

   Display Technologies

   ﻿

			Goodwill for the Display Technologies segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components.  For the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics.  On a quarterly basis in 2017, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the Display Technologies reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount.

			In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.  A discount rate of 5.8% and a growth rate of 1% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  We determined a range of discount rates between 3.8% and 7.8% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.

   ﻿

   Optical Communications

   ﻿

			Goodwill for the Optical Communications segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components.  For the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics.  On a quarterly basis in 2017, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the Optical Communications reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount.

   ﻿

			In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.  A discount rate of 5.6% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  We determined a range of discount rates between 3.6% and 7.6% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.

   ﻿

   Specialty Materials

   ﻿

			Goodwill for the Specialty Materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below an operating segment, as the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with a certain business within this operating segment.  On a quarterly basis in 2017, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the Specialty Materials reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount.

   ﻿

			In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.  A discount rate of 5.8% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  We determined a range of discount rates between 3.8% and 7.8% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.

   ﻿

   Life Sciences

   ﻿

			Goodwill for the Life Sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level.  On a quarterly basis in 2017, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the Life Sciences reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount.

   ﻿

			In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.  A discount rate of 6% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  We determined a range of discount rates between 4% and 8% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.

   ﻿

   All Other

   ﻿

			All Other segment is comprised of various operating segments and corporate investments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting.  Goodwill for the All Other segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level.  For the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have identified two reporting units in this segment that require an assessment of their goodwill.  On a quarterly basis in 2017, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the reporting units’ fair value is less than the carrying amount.

   ﻿

			In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability tests in 2015.  A discount rate of 7.4% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the book value of one of the reporting units exceeded its fair value by 80%.  We determined a range of discount rates between 5.4% and 9.4% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.  Corning concluded that a Step 2 analysis was required to measure the impairment loss for this reporting unit.

   Index

Our Step 2 test consisted of identifying the underlying net assets in the reporting unit, allocating the implied purchase price to the asset and liabilities of the reporting unit and the calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill and the resulting impairment loss.  In December 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $29 million related to this reporting unit.

   ﻿

   Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions

   ﻿

			We are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized.  We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs.  Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome.  The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas, including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses.

   ﻿

			Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment.  We are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value.  We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned.

   ﻿

   Income taxes

   ﻿

			We are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies.  These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.

   ﻿

			Corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  In estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position.  As a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.

   ﻿

			At December 31, 2017, Corning has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act.  Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its U.S. deferred tax balances, the one-time toll charge and the impact on its state valuation allowances.  In addition, Corning has not made sufficient progress on estimating the impact of tax reform on its assertion regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings so the Company will continue to follow its historic position while it continues to analyze this issue.  In addition, Corning’s accounting for the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete and, as a result, it has not yet elected a policy to account for the GILTI provisions.

   ﻿

			The initial accounting is incomplete as we need additional time and information to analyze all aspects of the newly enacted law and how it impacts our worldwide operations.  The additional information that needs to be obtained, prepared or analyzed in order to complete the accounting requirements includes receiving further guidance from the tax authorities; additional time to prepare basis calculations; post enactment impacts and further time to validate of our assumptions.

   Equity method investments

   ﻿

			On May 31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced on December 10, 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its 50% stock interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.

   Index

			The equity in earnings line on our income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones (Hemlock Semiconductor) businesses of Dow Corning from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2016, the closing date of the Transaction Agreement, and seven months of equity earnings from Hemlock Semiconductor Group.  Prior to the realignment of Dow Corning, equity earnings from the Hemlock Semiconductor business were reported on the equity in earnings line in Corning’s income statement, net of Dow Corning’s 35% U.S. tax.  Additionally, Corning reported its tax on equity earnings from Dow Corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a U.S. tax provision rate of 7%.  As part of the realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group was converted to a partnership.  Each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings.  Therefore, post-realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group’s equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and Corning’s tax is reported on the tax provision line.

   ﻿

			At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of our equity method investment assets was $280 million and $269 million, respectively.  In addition, we also have an equity investment (HSG) with a negative carrying value of $105 million.  The negative carrying value resulted from a one-time charge to this entity in 2014 for the permanent abandonment of certain assets.    We review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if events or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other-than-temporarily impaired.  When such indicators are present, we then perform an in-depth review for impairment.  An impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability, forecasted tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate movements, terminal value assumptions, historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable.

   ﻿

   Fair value measures

   ﻿

			As required, Corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels.  Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement.  In addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets.  Corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives.  These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.

   ﻿

			Derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.  Included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, euro, New Taiwan dollar and Chinese yuan.  These contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net line of the Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.  In arriving at the fair value of Corning’s derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction.  Amounts related to credit risk are not material.

   ﻿

   Refer to Note 16 (Fair Value Measurements) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

   ﻿

   Probability of litigation outcomes

   ﻿

			We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case-specific issues.  See Part II – Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of Corning’s material litigation matters.

   ﻿

   Other possible liabilities

   ﻿

			We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.

   Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB)

   ﻿

			Corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.  While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.

   ﻿

			Costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.

   ﻿

			Costs for our OPEB plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  We recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates as a component of Stockholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.

   ﻿

			Prior to the December 31, 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, Corning used the traditional, single weighted-average discount rate approach to develop the obligation, interest cost and service cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.  The individual spot rates from the yield curve are used in measuring the pension plan projected benefit obligation (PBO) or OPEB plan accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) at the measurement date.  The benefit obligation is effectively calculated as the aggregate present value at the measurement date of each future benefit payment related to past service, with each payment discounted using a spot rate from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve that matches the duration of the benefit payment.  Under Corning’s traditional, single weighted-average discount rate approach, a single weighted-average rate is developed from the approach described above and rounded to the nearest 25 basis points.  Traditionally, the weighted-average discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date, based on the same projected future benefit payments used in developing the benefit obligation.  The traditional single weighted-average discount rate represents the constant annual rate that would be required to discount all future benefit payments related to past service from the date of expected future payment to the measurement date such that the aggregate present value equals the benefit obligation.

   ﻿

			Beginning with the December 31, 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, Corning changed its methodology of determining the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs to a more granular approach.  Under the new approach, the cash flows from each applicable pension and OPEB plan are used to directly calculate the benefit obligation, service cost and interest cost using the spot rates from the applicable yield curve.

   ﻿

			Moving to a more granular approach has a limited impact on the determination of the respective benefit obligations.  The only impacts are as a result of the elimination of the rounding of the discount rate that occurred in the traditional approach and the use of specific cash flows for Corning’s non-qualified pension plans, while separately applying the yield curve to each separate OPEB plan instead of aggregating the OPEB plan cash flows.  For Corning’s pension plans, this change will increase the immediate recognition of actuarial losses (or decrease the immediate recognition of actuarial gains), due to Corning’s previous election to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor.  For Corning’s OPEB plans, this change will increase the accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) account balance due to the accumulation of lower actuarial gains or higher actuarial losses.  Over time, the amortization of the actuarial losses from AOCI will begin to reduce the savings from the lower interest cost and service cost.

   ﻿

			This change was a change in accounting estimate and therefore was applied prospectively beginning with the measurement date of December 31, 2015.  No restatement of prior periods is required.

			As of December 31, 2017, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $3,519 million.

25 basis point increase in each spot rate + 2 million - 97 million
25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets + 7 million
25 basis point increase in expected return on assets - 7 million

   ﻿

			The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.  Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.  These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Corning’s funding requirements.

   ﻿

			In addition, at December 31, 2017, a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by $128 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase stockholders’ equity by $123 million.  In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate.

   ﻿

   The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in each spot rate assumption related to Corning’s U.S. OPEB plans:

   Revenue recognition

   ﻿

			The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.  In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors.  These estimates are supported by historical data.  Corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue on a completed contract basis.  Revenues under the completed-contract method are recognized upon substantial completion, defined as acceptance by the customer and compliance with performance specifications as agreed upon in the contract, which in certain instances requires estimates and judgments in determining the timing of substantial completion of the contract.  While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Corning’s future results.

   ﻿

   Share-Based Compensation

   ﻿

			Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.  Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends.  In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.  If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, share-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

[Refer to Note 14]:
NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.

The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our CEO, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. For fiscal 2017, we have the following reportable segments: - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ * Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere.

We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.
