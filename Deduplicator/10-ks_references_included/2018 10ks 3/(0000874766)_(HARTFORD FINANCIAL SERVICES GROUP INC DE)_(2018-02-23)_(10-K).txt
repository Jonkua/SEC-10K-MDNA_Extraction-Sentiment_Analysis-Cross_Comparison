Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

insurance and annuity run-off entities was in excess of 300% of its respective Company Action Levels as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The reporting of RBC ratios is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company, or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising, or promotional activities.
Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries have solvency margins in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.

Sensitivity
In any particular year, statutory capital amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory capital or RBC ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. For further discussion on these factors and the potential impacts to the life insurance subsidiaries, see MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management, Financial Risk on Statutory Capital.
Statutory capital at the property and casualty subsidiaries has historically been maintained at or above the capital level required to meet “AA level” ratings from rating agencies. Statutory capital generated by the property and casualty subsidiaries in excess of the capital level required to meet “AA level” ratings is available for use by the enterprise or for corporate purposes. The amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting property and casualty results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.

Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
For a discussion regarding contingencies related to The Hartford’s legal proceedings, please see the information contained under “Litigation” and “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part II, Item 1 Legal Proceedings, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Legislative and Regulatory Developments
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the "Affordable Care Act") It is unclear whether the Administration and Congress will seek to amend or alter the ongoing operation of the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"). If such actions were to occur, they may have an impact on various aspects of our business, including our insurance businesses. It is unclear what an amended ACA would entail, and to what extent there may be a transition period for the phase out of the ACA. The impact to The Hartford as an employer would be consistent with other large employers. The Hartford’s core business does not involve the issuance of health insurance, and we have not observed any material impacts on the Company’s workers’

compensation business or group benefits business from the enactment of the ACA. We will continue to monitor the impact of the ACA and any reforms on consumer, broker and medical provider behavior for leading indicators of changes in medical costs or loss payments primarily on the Company's workers' compensation and disability liabilities.
United States Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule On April 6, 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued a final regulation expanding the range of activities considered to be fiduciary investment advice under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and the Internal Revenue Code. While implementation of the rule was to be phased in, the DOL has since delayed those dates. Based on comments received, the DOL has delayed the transition period to July 1, 2019. DOL intends to continue coordination with the SEC and other regulators, including state insurance regulators.
The impact of the new regulation on our mutual fund business is difficult to assess because the regulation is new and is still being studied. While we continue to analyze the regulation, we believe the regulation may impact the compensation paid to the financial intermediaries who sell our mutual funds to their retirement clients and could negatively impact our mutual funds business.
In 2016, several plaintiffs, including insurers and industry groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), filed a lawsuit against the DOL challenging the constitutionality of the fiduciary rule, and the DOL's rulemaking authority. In most cases, the district courts have entered a summary judgment in favor of the DOL. Certain cases were appealed to the Fifth Circuit and on July 5, 2017, the DOL filed a brief in support of upholding the rule. We continue to monitor potential effects of case law and the regulatory landscape on our mutual funds business.
Tax Reform At the end of 2017, Congress passed and the president signed, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform"), which enacted significant reforms to the U.S. tax code. The major areas of interest to the company include the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the refunding of AMT credits. We continue to analyze Tax Reform for other potential impacts. The U.S. Treasury and IRS will develop guidance implementing Tax Reform, and Congress may consider additional technical corrections to the legislation. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear. For additional information on risks to the Company related to Tax Reform, please see the risk factor entitled "Changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity" under "Risk Factors" in Part I.

Part II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
The Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31, 2017.
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting
The management of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As discussed in Note 2 - Business Acquisitions of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company acquired Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business on November 1, 2017. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the internal controls over financial reporting associated with this acquired business. At December 31, 2017, the acquisition accounted for approximately 2.4% of consolidated assets and 2.2% of consolidated revenue. As a result of the timing of this

acquisition, we have excluded this business from the annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The Hartford's management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2017.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm
The Hartford's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting which is set forth below.

Part II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hartford, Connecticut
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business, which was acquired on November 1, 2017 and whose financial statements constitutes 2.4% of total assets and 2.2% of revenues of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at the acquired business.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Equity Compensation Plan Information
The following table provides information as of December 31, 2017 about the securities authorized for issuance under the Company’s equity compensation plans. The Company maintains The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”), The Hartford 2010 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2010 Stock Plan”), The Hartford 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the "2014 Stock Plan") (collectively the "Stock Plans") and The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). On May 21, 2014, the shareholders of

the Company approved the 2014 Stock Plan, which superseded the earlier plans. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2014 Stock Plan, no additional shares may be issued from the 2010 Stock Plan. To the extent that any awards under the 2005 Stock Plan and the 2010 Stock Plan are forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expire unexercised or are settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number of shares subject to the award, the shares subject to such awards (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for award under the 2014 Stock Plan and such shares shall be added to the total number of shares available under the 2014 Stock Plan.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hartford, Connecticut
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and the consolidated financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a holding company for insurance and financial services subsidiaries that provide property and casualty insurance, group life and disability products and mutual funds and exchange-traded products to individual and business customers in the United States (collectively, “The Hartford”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”).
On December 3, 2017, Hartford Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the issued and outstanding equity of Hartford Life, Inc. (“HLI”), a holding company, and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries.
On November 1, 2017, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (HLA), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business through a reinsurance transaction.
On May 10, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its United Kingdom ("U.K.") property and casualty run-off subsidiaries.
On July 29, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Northern Homelands Company, the holding company of Maxum Specialty Insurance Group (collectively "Maxum"). On July 29, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Lattice Strategies LLC ("Lattice").
For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 2 - Business Acquisitions and Note 20 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) which differ materially from the accounting practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.
Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest. Entities in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions but does not control, are reported using the equity method. All intercompany transactions and balances between The Hartford and its subsidiaries and affiliates that are not held for sale have been eliminated .
Discontinued Operations
The results of operations of a component of the Company are reported in discontinued operations when certain criteria are met as of the date of disposal, or earlier if classified as held-for-sale. When a component is identified for discontinued operations reporting, amounts for prior periods are retrospectively reclassified as discontinued operations. Components are identified as discontinued operations if they are a major part of an entity's operations and financial results such as a separate major

line of business or a separate major geographical area of operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The most significant estimates include those used in determining property and casualty and group long-term disability insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance; evaluation of goodwill for impairment; valuation of investments and derivative instruments; valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation. In particular:
With respect to the Consolidated Statement of Operations:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Billing installment fees that were previously reflected as an offset to insurance operating costs and other expenses are now classified as fee income.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Flood servicing business has been realigned from specialty commercial within the Commercial Lines reporting segment to the Personal Lines reporting segment.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amortization of other intangible assets has been reclassified out of insurance operating costs and other expenses.

With respect to the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Assets and liabilities associated with the Company's life and annuity run-off business are now classified as assets and liabilities held for sale.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and reinsurance recoverables for structured settlements reserves and recoverables due from the Company's life and annuity run-off business now classified as held for sale have been reclassified into the Company's P&C commercial lines business. Annuities purchased from the Company's life and annuity run-off business are recognized as reinsurance recoverables in cases where the Company has not obtained a release from the claimant. These amounts were previously eliminated in consolidation.

- ---------------------------------------------------------
• Policy loans have been reclassified to other investments.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------
• Other intangible assets have been reclassified out of other assets.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Stock Compensation
On January 1, 2017 the Company adopted new stock compensation guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") on a prospective basis. The updated guidance requires the excess tax benefit or tax deficiency on vesting or settlement of stock-based awards to be recognized in earnings as an income tax benefit or expense, respectively, instead of as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. The new guidance also requires the related cash flows to be presented in operating activities instead of in financing activities. The amount of excess tax benefit or tax deficiency realized on vesting or settlement of awards depends upon the difference between the market value of awards at vesting or settlement and the grant date fair value recognized through compensation expense. The excess tax benefit or tax deficiency is a discrete item in the reporting period in which it occurs and is not considered in determining the annual estimated effective tax rate for interim reporting. The excess tax benefit recognized in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $15, and the excess tax benefit recognized in additional paid-in capital for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $5 and $27, respectively.
Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Reclassification of Effect of Tax Rate Change from AOCI to Retained Earnings
In February, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to items recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") resulting from legislated tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017. The tax reform reduced the federal tax rate applied to the Company’s deferred tax balances from 35% to 21% on enactment.  Under U.S. GAAP the Company recorded the total effect of the change in enacted tax rates on deferred tax balances in the income tax expense component of net income.  The new accounting guidance permits the Company to reclassify the “stranded” tax effects out of AOCI and into retained earnings that resulted from recording the tax effects of unrealized investment gains, unrecognized actuarial losses on pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and cumulative translation adjustments at a 35% tax rate because the 14 point reduction in tax rate was recognized in net income instead of other comprehensive income. The Company will adopt the new guidance as of January 1, 2018. As a result of the reclassification, on January 1, 2018, the Company will reduce the estimated loss on sale recorded in income from discontinued operations by $193, net of tax, for the increase in AOCI related to the assets held for sale. The reduction in the loss on sale will result in a corresponding increase in assets held for sale and AOCI as of January 1, 2018 and the AOCI associated with assets held for sale will be removed from the balance sheet when the sale closes.

Additionally, as of January 1, 2018, the Company will reclassify $105 of stranded tax effects related to continuing operations which will have the effect of reducing AOCI and increasing retained earnings.
Hedging Activities
The FASB issued updated guidance on hedge accounting. The updates allow hedge accounting for new types of interest rate hedges of financial instruments and simplify documentation requirements to qualify for hedge accounting. In addition, any gain or loss from hedge ineffectiveness will be reported in the same income statement line with the effective hedge results and the hedged transaction. For cash flow hedges, the ineffectiveness will be recognized in earnings only when the hedged transaction affects earnings; otherwise, the ineffectiveness gains or losses will remain in AOCI. Under current accounting, total hedge ineffectiveness is reported separately in realized gains and losses apart from the hedged transaction. The updated guidance is effective January 1, 2019 through a cumulative effect adjustment that will reclassify cumulative ineffectiveness on open cash flow hedges from retained earnings to AOCI. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a year. The Company has not yet determined the timing for adoption or estimated the effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Goodwill
The FASB issued updated guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The updated guidance requires recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment based on the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit compared to its estimated fair value, with the amount of the impairment not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Under existing guidance, if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. An impairment loss is then recognized for the excess, if any, of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill compared to the implied goodwill value. The Company expects to adopt the updated guidance January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis as required, although earlier adoption is permitted. While the Company would not have recognized a goodwill impairment loss for the years presented, the impact of the adoption will depend on the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units compared to the carrying value at adoption.
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
The FASB issued updated guidance for recognition and measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance will replace the “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for recognizing credit losses for instruments carried at other than fair value, which will initially result in the recognition of greater allowances for losses. The allowance will be an estimate of credit losses expected over the life of debt instruments, such as mortgage loans, reinsurance recoverables and receivables. Credit losses on fixed maturities available-for-sale (“AFS”) carried at fair value will continue to be measured like other-than-temporary impairments ("OTTI"); however, the losses will be recognized through an allowance and no longer as an adjustment to the cost basis. Recoveries of OTTI

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

will be recognized as reversals of valuation allowances and no longer accreted as investment income through an adjustment to the investment yield. The allowance on fixed maturities AFS cannot cause the net carrying value to be below fair value and, therefore, it is possible that future increases in fair value due to decreases in market interest rates could cause the reversal of a valuation allowance and increase net income. The new guidance also requires purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance to be recorded based on contractual amounts due and an initial allowance recorded at the date of purchase. The guidance is effective January 1, 2020, through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for the change in the allowance for credit losses for debt instruments carried at other than fair value. No allowance will be recognized at adoption for fixed maturities AFS; rather, their cost basis will be evaluated for an allowance for credit losses prospectively. The Company expects to adopt the updated guidance January 1, 2020, as required, although earlier adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2019. The Company has not yet determined the effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the ultimate impact of the adoption will depend on the composition of the debt instruments and market conditions at the adoption date. Significant implementation matters yet to be addressed include estimating lifetime expected losses on debt instruments carried at other than fair value, determining the impact of valuation allowances on net investment income from fixed maturities AFS, updating our investment accounting system functionality to maintain adjustable valuation allowance on fixed maturities, AFS, subject to a fair value floor, and developing a detailed implementation plan.
Leases
The FASB issued updated guidance on lease accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees with operating leases will be required to recognize a liability for the present value of future minimum lease payments with a corresponding asset for the right of use of the property. Under existing guidance, future minimum lease payments on operating leases are commitments that are not recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. The updated guidance is to be adopted effective January 1, 2019 through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for the earliest period presented, with early application permitted. Leases will be classified as financing or operating leases. Where the lease is economically similar to a purchase because The Hartford obtains control of the underlying asset, the lease will be a financing lease and the Company will recognize amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense on the liability. Where the lease provides The Hartford with only the right to control the use of the underlying asset over the lease term and the lease term is greater than one year, the lease will be an operating lease and the lease costs will be recognized as rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a term of one year or less will also be expensed over the lease term but will not be recognized on the balance sheet. The Company will adopt the new lease guidance effective January 1, 2019, and is currently evaluating the potential impact of the new guidance to the consolidated financial statements and the method of adoption. We do not expect a material impact to the consolidated financial statements; however, it is expected that assets and liabilities will increase

based on the present value of remaining lease payments for leases in place at the adoption date.
Financial Instruments- Recognition and Measurement
The FASB issued updated guidance for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance will require investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income except for investments that are consolidated or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The new guidance will also require a deferred tax asset resulting from net unrealized losses on available-for-sale fixed maturities that are recognized in AOCI to be evaluated for recoverability in combination with the Company’s other deferred tax assets. Under existing guidance, the Company measures investments in equity securities, AFS at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income. As required, the Company will adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2018 through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings. Early adoption is not allowed. The impact to the Company will be increased volatility in net income beginning in 2018. Any difference in the evaluation of deferred tax assets may also affect stockholders' equity. Cash flows will not be affected. The impact will depend on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio in the future and changes in fair value of the Company’s investments. As of January 1, 2018, the Company will reclassify from AOCI to retained earnings net unrealized gains of $83, after tax, related to equity securities, AFS having a fair value of $1.0 billion. Had the new accounting guidance been in place since the beginning of 2017, the Company would have recognized mark-to-market gains of $25 after-tax in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Revenue Recognition
The FASB issued updated guidance for recognizing revenue. The guidance excludes insurance contracts and financial instruments. Revenue is to be recognized when, or as, goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity is expected to receive in exchange for those goods or services, and this accounting guidance is similar to current accounting for many transactions. This guidance is effective retrospectively on January 1, 2018, with a choice of restating prior periods or recognizing a cumulative effect for contracts in place as of the adoption date. Upon adoption on January 1, 2018, the Company will present fee income within the Mutual Funds segment gross of related distribution costs that are currently netted against revenues.  Distribution costs of $188, $184, and $190 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, will be reclassified from fee income to insurance operating costs and other expenses. The adoption will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or net income.

Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
Property and casualty insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period and include accruals for ultimate premium revenue anticipated under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. Unearned premiums represent the premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds, management’s experience and current economic conditions. The Company charges off any balances that are determined to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $132 and $137 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Group life, disability and accident premiums are generally both due from policyholders and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the period of the contracts.
The Company provides investment management, administrative and distribution services to mutual funds and exchange-traded products. The Company earns fees, primarily based on the average daily net asset values of the mutual funds and exchange-traded products, which are recorded as fee income in the period in which the services are provided. Commission fees are based on the sale proceeds and recognized at the time of the transaction. Transfer agent fees are assessed as a charge per account and recognized as fee income in the period in which the services are provided.
Other revenues primarily consists of servicing revenues which are recognized as services are performed.
Dividends to Policyholders
Policyholder dividends are paid to certain property and casualty policyholders. Policies that receive dividends are referred to as participating policies. Participating dividends to policyholders are accrued and reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses and other liabilities using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.
Net written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance policies represented 10%, 9% and 10% of total net written premiums for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Participating dividends to property and casualty policyholders were $35, $15 and $17 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
There were no additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders.
Investments
Overview
The Company’s investments in fixed maturities include bonds, structured securities, redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper. Most of these investments, along with certain equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable

preferred stocks, are classified as available-for-sale ("AFS") and are carried at fair value. The after-tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Effective January 1, 2018, equity securities will be measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement discussion above. Fixed maturities for which the Company elected the fair value option are classified as FVO, generally certain securities that contain embedded credit derivatives, are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in realized capital gains and losses. Mortgage loans are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of valuation allowances. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value and are primarily accounted for under the equity method with the Company’s share of earnings included in net investment income. Recognition of income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial information, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month delay and hedge funds on a one-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships and other alternative investments’ general partners. Other investments primarily consist of derivative instruments which are carried at fair value.
Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses
Net realized capital gains and losses from investment sales are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized capital gains and losses also result from fair value changes in fixed maturities and equity securities FVO, and derivatives contracts (both free-standing and embedded) that do not qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes as well as ineffectiveness on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Impairments and mortgage loan valuation allowances are recognized as net realized capital losses in accordance with the Company’s impairment and mortgage loan valuation allowance policies as discussed in Note 6 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency transaction remeasurements are also included in net realized capital gains and losses.
Net Investment Income
Interest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized when earned on the constant effective yield method based on estimated timing of cash flows. The amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturities also takes into consideration call and maturity dates that produce the lowest yield. For securitized financial assets subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or estimated future prepayments using the retrospective method; however, if these investments are impaired and for certain other asset-backed securities, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees and make-whole payments on fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For

equity securities, dividends are recognized as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily use the equity method of accounting to recognize the Company’s share of earnings; however, for a portion of those investments, the Company used investment fund accounting applied to a wholly-owned fund of funds which was liquidated during 2016. For impaired debt securities, the Company accretes the new cost basis to the estimated future cash flows over the expected remaining life of the security by prospectively adjusting the security’s yield, if necessary. The Company’s non-income producing investments were not material for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Derivative Instruments
Overview
The Company utilizes a variety of over-the-counter ("OTC"), transactions cleared through central clearing houses ("OTC-cleared") and exchange traded derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions. The types of instruments may include swaps, caps, floors, forwards, futures and options to achieve one of four Company-approved objectives:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility;

- --------------------
• to manage liquidity;

- -----------------------------
• to control transaction costs;

- -------------------------------------------------
• to enter into synthetic replication transactions.

Interest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, little to no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.
Interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified dates, the amount, if any, by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike interest rate or falls below the floor strike interest rate, applied to a notional principal amount. A premium payment determined at inception is made by the purchaser of the contract and no principal payments are exchanged.
Forward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.
Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled daily in cash.

Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The contracts may reference commodities, which grant the purchaser the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer commodities at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.
Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.
The Company’s derivative transactions conducted in insurance company subsidiaries are used in strategies permitted under the derivative use plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York insurance departments.
Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty or under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.
The Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based on daily market value movements. For information on collateral, see the derivative collateral arrangements section in Note 7 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, OTC-cleared transactions include price alignment amounts either received or paid on the variation margin, which are reflected in realized capital gains and losses or, if characterized as interest, in net investment income.
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges - Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities - The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses.
Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing
To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness and ineffectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values, cash flows or net investment in foreign operations of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed primarily using quantitative methods as well as using qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Hedge ineffectiveness of the hedge relationships are measured each reporting period using the “Change in Variable Cash Flows Method”, the “Change in Fair Value Method”, the “Hypothetical Derivative Method”, or the “Dollar Offset Method”.
Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value

hedge, the derivative continues to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is no longer adjusted through current period earnings and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item through the applicable earnings component associated with the hedged item.
When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.
In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.
Embedded Derivatives
The Company purchases investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and losses.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives exceed the contractual thresholds. For the Company’s domestic derivative programs, the maximum uncollateralized threshold for a derivative counterparty for a single legal entity is $10. The Company also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk

due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.
Cash
Cash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions.
Reinsurance
The Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to diversify its exposures and provide statutory surplus relief. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers and is a member of and participates in reinsurance pools and associations. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies or pools have underwritten.
Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e. risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting, and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer. If the ceded and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as financing transactions.
Premiums, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded and assumed reinsurance transactions. Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums, which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables are balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Changes in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reported in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and concentrations of credit risk. Reinsurance is placed with reinsurers that meet strict financial criteria established by the Company.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs
Deferred policy acquisition costs ("DAC") represent costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts and incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that are incurred in transactions with either independent third parties or employees. Such costs primarily include commissions, premium taxes, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully issued contracts.
For property and casualty insurance products and group life, disability and accident contracts, costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are

earned. Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of DAC.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax provision is recorded for the tax effects of differences between the Company's current taxable income and its income before tax under generally accepted accounting principles in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For deferred tax assets, the Company records a valuation allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost to acquire a business over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. The goodwill impairment test follows a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
Management’s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations, including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital required to support the business, future business growth, earnings projections and assets under management for certain reporting units and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairments.
Intangible Assets
Acquired intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include purchased customer and agency or other distribution relationships and licenses measured at fair value at acquisition. The Company amortizes finite-lived other intangible assets over their useful lives generally on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, ranging from 1 to 15 years. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment

F-14

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

generally when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangibles. If the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment which includes capitalized software is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is determined principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation was $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Depreciation expense was $197, $186, and $164 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
For property and casualty and group life and disability insurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future losses and loss adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process. A number of complex factors influence the uncertainties involved with the reserving process including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by reserve line within the various reporting segments. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
Most of the Company’s property and casualty insurance products reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted to present value certain reserves for indemnity payments that are due to permanently disabled claimants under workers’ compensation policies because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rate is based on the risk free rate for the expected claim duration as determined in the year the claims were incurred. The Company also has discounted liabilities for structured settlement agreements that provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. These structured settlements include annuities purchased to fund unpaid losses for permanently disabled claimants. Most of the annuities have been issued by the

life and annuity run-off business held for sale and the annuity obligations are now included as part of liabilities held for sale, recognized at present value. Upon classifying the life and annuity run-off business as held-for-sale, the Company increased property & casualty reinsurance recoverables and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for annuities issued by the life and annuity run-off business to fund structured settlement payments where the claimant has not released the Company of its obligation totaling $688 and $712 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These structured settlement liabilities were discounted to present value using an average interest rate of 6.70% in 2017 and 6.69% in 2016.
Group life and disability contracts with long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned on the cash flows net of investment expenses and expected credit losses. The Company establishes discount rates for these reserves in the year the claims are incurred (the incurral year) which is when the estimated settlement pattern is determined. The discount rate for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business were based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017.
For further information about how unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established, see Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign Currency
Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The national currencies of the international operations are generally their functional currencies. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings in realized capital gains (losses) in the period in which they occur.

2. Business Acquisitions

Aetna Group Insurance
On November 1, 2017, The Hartford acquired Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business through a reinsurance transaction for total consideration of $1.452 billion, comprised of cash of $1.450 billion and share-based awards of $2. The acquisition enables the Company to increase its market share in the group life and disability industry.

The value of in-force contracts represents the estimated profits relating to the unexpired contracts in force at the acquisition date through expiry of the contracts. The value of customer relationships was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from the renewals of in-force contracts acquired less costs to service the related policies. The value of the marketing agreement with Aetna was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from incremental new business written during the three-year duration of the agreement, less costs to service

the related contracts. The value for each of the identifiable intangible assets was estimated using a discounted cash flow method. Significant inputs to the valuation models include estimates of expected premiums, persistency rates, investment returns, claim costs, expenses and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital.
Property and equipment represents an internally developed integrated absence management software acquired that was valued based on estimated replacement cost. The software will be amortized over five years on a straight-line basis.
Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses acquired were recorded at estimated fair value equal to the present value of expected future unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments discounted using the net investment yield estimated as of the acquisition date plus a risk margin. The fair value adjustment for the risk margin will be amortized over 12 years based on the payout pattern of losses and loss expenses as estimated as of the acquisition date.
Since the acquisition date of November 1, 2017, the revenues and earnings of the business acquired have been included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Group Benefits reporting segment and were $370 and $(37) respectively.
The $723 of goodwill recognized is largely attributable to the acquired employee workforce, expected expense synergies, economies of scale, and tax benefits not included within the value of identifiable intangibles. Goodwill is allocated to the Company's Group Benefits reporting segment.
The Company recognized $17 of acquisition related costs for the year ended December 31, 2017. These costs are included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The acquisition date fair values of certain assets and liabilities, including insurance reserves and intangible assets, as well as the related estimated useful lives of intangibles, are provisional and are subject to revision within one year of the acquisition date. Under the terms of the agreement, a final balance sheet will be agreed to in 2018 and our estimates of fair values are pending finalization.
The following table presents supplemental unaudited pro forma amounts of revenue and net income for the Company in 2016 and 2017 as though the business was acquired on January 1, 2016. Pro forma adjustments include the revenue and earnings of the Aetna U.S. group life and disability business for each period as well as amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired and of the fair value adjustment to acquired insurance reserves. Pro forma adjustments do not include retrospective adjustments to defer and amortize acquisition costs as would be recorded under the Company’s accounting policy.

Lattice's revenues and earnings since the acquisition date are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Mutual Funds reporting segment and are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations.
In addition to the initial cash consideration, the Company is required to make future payments to the former owners of Lattice of up to $60 based upon growth in ETP AUM over a four-year period beginning on the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration was measured at fair value at the acquisition date by projecting future ETP AUM and discounting expected payments back to the valuation date. The projected ETP AUM and risk-adjusted discount rate are significant unobservable inputs to fair value.
The goodwill recognized is attributable to the fact that the acquisition of Lattice enables the Company to offer ETPs which are expected to be a significant source of future revenue and earnings growth. Goodwill is allocated to the Mutual Funds reporting segment.
The Company recognized $1 of acquisition related costs for the year ended December 31, 2016. These costs are included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] For additional information, see Note 15 - Equity and Note 19 - Stock Compensation Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of assumed exercise or issuance of warrants and stock-based awards under compensation plans. Diluted potential common shares are included in the calculation of diluted per share amounts provided there is income from continuing operations, net of tax.
Under the treasury stock method, for warrants and stock-based awards, shares are assumed to be issued and then reduced for the number of shares repurchaseable with theoretical proceeds at the average market price for the period. Contingently issuable shares are included for the number of shares issuable assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period, if dilutive.
As a result of the net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company was required to use basic weighted average common shares outstanding in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the inclusion of 4.3 million shares for stock compensation plans and 2.5 million shares for warrants would have been antidilutive to the earnings (loss) per share calculation. In the absence of the net loss, weighted average common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares would have totaled 370.5 million.

5. Fair Value Measurements

The Company carries certain financial assets and liabilities at estimated fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants. Our fair value framework includes a hierarchy that gives the highest priority to the use of quoted prices in active markets, followed by the use of market observable inputs, followed by the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy levels are as follows:

------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1 Fair values based primarily on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets, or liabilities, in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2 Fair values primarily based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, or based on prices for similar assets and liabilities.

------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 3 Fair values derived when one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable (including assumptions about risk). With little or no observable market, the determination of fair values uses considerable judgment and represents the Company’s best estimate of an amount that could be realized in a market exchange for the asset or liability. Also included are securities that are traded within illiquid markets and/or priced by independent brokers.

The Company will classify the financial asset or liability by level based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. In most cases, both observable inputs (e.g., changes in interest rates) and unobservable inputs (e.g., changes in risk assumptions) are used to determine fair values that the Company has classified within Level 3.

Valuation Techniques
The Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a "waterfall" approach

comprised of the following pricing sources and techniques, which are listed in priority order:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, which are classified as Level 1.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Prices from third-party pricing services, which primarily utilize a combination of techniques. These services utilize recently reported trades of identical, similar, or benchmark securities making adjustments for market observable inputs available through the reporting date. If there are no recently reported trades, they may use a discounted cash flow technique to develop a price using expected cash flows based upon the anticipated future performance of the underlying collateral discounted at an estimated market rate. Both techniques develop prices that consider the time value of future cash flows and provide a margin for risk, including liquidity and credit risk. Most prices provided by third-party

F-22

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
5. Fair Value Measurements (continued)

pricing services are classified as Level 2 because the inputs used in pricing the securities are observable. However, some securities that are less liquid or trade less actively are classified as Level 3. Additionally, certain long-dated securities, including certain municipal securities, foreign government/government agency securities, and bank loans, include benchmark interest rate or credit spread assumptions that are not observable in the marketplace and are thus classified as Level 3.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Internal matrix pricing, which is a valuation process internally developed for private placement securities for which the Company is unable to obtain a price from a third-party pricing service. Internal pricing matrices determine credit spreads that, when combined with risk-free rates, are applied to contractual cash flows to develop a price. The Company develops credit spreads using market based data for public securities adjusted for credit spread differentials between public and private securities, which are obtained from a survey of multiple private placement brokers. The market-based reference credit spread considers the issuer’s financial strength and term to maturity, using an independent public security index and trade information, while the credit spread differential considers the non-public nature of the security. Securities priced using internal matrix pricing are classified as Level 2 because the inputs are observable or can be corroborated with observable data.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Independent broker quotes, which are typically non-binding, use inputs that can be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data. Brokers may use present value techniques using assumptions specific to the security types, or they may use recent transactions of similar securities. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3.

The fair value of free-standing derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. The pricing valuation models primarily use inputs that are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data. The valuation of certain derivatives may include significant inputs that are unobservable, such as volatility levels, and reflect the Company’s view of what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments.
Valuation Controls
The fair value process for investments is monitored by the Valuation Committee, which is a cross-functional group of senior management within the Company that meets at least quarterly. The purpose of the committee is to oversee the pricing policy and procedures, as well as to approve changes to valuation methodologies and pricing sources. Controls and procedures used to assess third-party pricing services are reviewed by the Valuation Committee, including the results of annual due-diligence reviews.
There are also two working groups under the Valuation Committee: a Securities Fair Value Working Group (“Securities

Working Group”) and a Derivatives Fair Value Working Group ("Derivatives Working Group"). The working groups, which include various investment, operations, accounting and risk management professionals, meet monthly to review market data trends, pricing and trading statistics and results, and any proposed pricing methodology changes.
The Securities Working Group reviews prices received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The group considers trading volume, new issuance activity, market trends, new regulatory rulings and other factors to determine whether the market activity is significantly different than normal activity in an active market. A dedicated pricing unit follows up with trading and investment sector professionals and challenges prices of third-party pricing services when the estimated assumptions used differ from what the unit believes a market participant would use. If the available evidence indicates that pricing from third-party pricing services or broker quotes is based upon transactions that are stale or not from trades made in an orderly market, the Company places little, if any, weight on the third party service’s transaction price and will estimate fair value using an internal process, such as a pricing matrix.
The Derivatives Working Group reviews the inputs, assumptions and methodologies used to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. A dedicated pricing team works directly with investment sector professionals to investigate the impacts of changes in the market environment on prices or valuations of derivatives. New models and any changes to current models are required to have detailed documentation and are validated to a second source. The model validation documentation and results of validation are presented to the Valuation Committee for approval.
The Company conducts other monitoring controls around securities and derivatives pricing including, but not limited to, the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Review of daily price changes over specific thresholds and new trade comparison to third-party pricing services.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Daily comparison of OTC derivative market valuations to counterparty valuations.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Review of weekly price changes compared to published bond prices of a corporate bond index.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Monthly reviews of price changes over thresholds, stale prices, missing prices, and zero prices.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Monthly validation of prices to a second source for securities in most sectors and for certain derivatives.

In addition, the Company’s enterprise-wide Operational Risk Management function, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for model risk management and provides an independent review of the suitability and reliability of model inputs, as well as an analysis of significant changes to current models.
Valuation Inputs
Quoted prices for identical assets in active markets are considered Level 1 and consist of on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, exchange-traded equity securities, open-

[2] The swaptions presented are purchased options that have the right to enter into a pay-fixed swap.

The tables above exclude the portion of ABS, CRE CDOs and certain corporate securities for which fair values are predominately based on independent broker quotes. While the Company does not have access to the significant unobservable inputs that independent brokers may use in their pricing process, the Company believes brokers likely use inputs similar to those used by the Company and third-party pricing services to price similar instruments. As such, in their pricing models, brokers likely use estimated loss severity rates, prepayment rates, constant default rates and credit spreads. Therefore, similar to non-broker priced securities, increases in these inputs would generally cause fair values to decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no significant adjustments were made by the Company to broker prices received.
Transfers between Levels
Transfers of securities among the levels occur at the beginning of the reporting period. The amount of transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 was $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which represented previously on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities that are now off-the-run. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no transfers from Level 2 to Level 1. See the fair value roll-forward tables for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, for the transfers into and out of Level 3.

Contingent Consideration
The acquisition of Lattice Strategies LLC ("Lattice") in 2016 requires the Company to make payments to former owners of

Lattice of up to $60 contingent upon growth in exchange-traded products ("ETP") AUM over a four-year period beginning on the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration is measured at fair value on a quarterly basis by projecting future eligible ETP AUM over the contingency period to estimate the amount of expected payout. The future expected payout is discounted back to the valuation date using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 18.8%. The risk-adjusted discount rate is an internally generated and significant unobservable input to fair value.
Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable Inputs
The Company uses derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and liabilities. However, the derivative instrument may not be classified with the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated asset or liability. Therefore, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives reported in the Level 3 roll-forward may be offset by realized and unrealized gains and losses of the associated assets and liabilities in other line items of the financial statements.

Fair Value Option
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain securities that contain embedded credit derivatives with underlying credit risk primarily related to residential real estate, and these securities are included within Fixed Maturities, FVO on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For certain previously consolidated investment funds, the Company classified the underlying fixed maturities within Fixed Maturities, FVO as a result of the Company's management, control and significant ownership interest of the funds. The Company reported the underlying fixed maturities of these consolidated investment companies at fair value with changes in the fair value of these securities recognized in net realized capital gains and losses, which is consistent with accounting requirements for investment companies.
The Company also previously elected the fair value option for certain equity securities in order to align the accounting with total return swap contracts that hedged the risk associated with the investments. The swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting and the change in value of both the equity securities and the total return swaps were recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. These equity securities were classified within equity securities, AFS on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income earned from FVO securities was recorded in net investment income and changes in fair value were recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. The Company did not hold any of these equity securities as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016 .

[1]Included in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, except for current maturities, which are included in short-term debt.
Fair values for mortgage loans were estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on current lending rates for similar type loans. Current lending rates reflect changes in credit spreads and the remaining terms of the loans.
Fair values for other policyholder funds and benefits payable, not carried at fair value, are estimated based on the cash surrender

values of the underlying policies or by estimating future cash flows discounted at current interest rates adjusted for credit risk.
Fair values for senior notes and junior subordinated debentures are determined using the market approach based on reported trades, benchmark interest rates and issuer spread for the Company which may consider credit default swaps.

Sales of AFS securities in 2017 were primarily a result of duration and liquidity management as well as tactical changes to the portfolio as a result of changing market conditions.
Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments
The Company will record an other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) for fixed maturities and certain equity securities with debt-like characteristics (collectively “debt securities”) if the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before a recovery in value. A corresponding charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security.
The Company will also record an OTTI for those debt securities for which the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For these securities, the excess of the amortized cost basis over its fair value is separated into the portion representing a credit OTTI, which is recorded in net realized capital losses, and the remaining non-credit amount, which is recorded in OCI. The credit OTTI amount is the excess of its amortized cost basis over the Company’s best estimate of discounted expected future cash flows. The non-credit amount is the excess of the best estimate of the discounted expected future cash flows over the fair value. The Company’s best estimate of discounted expected future cash flows becomes the new cost basis and accretes prospectively into net investment income over the estimated remaining life of the security.
The Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with certain internal assumptions regarding the future performance. The Company's considerations include, but are not limited to, (a) changes in the financial condition of the issuer and the underlying collateral, (b) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (c) credit ratings, (d) payment structure of the security and (e) the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security.
For non-structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, economic and industry-specific trends and fundamentals, security-specific developments, industry earnings

F-31

multiples and the issuer’s ability to restructure and execute asset sales.
For structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, various performance indicators such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current and projected delinquency rates, loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios, average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year, prepayment speeds, and property value declines. These assumptions require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability of issuer default and estimates regarding timing and amount of expected recoveries which may include estimating the underlying collateral value.
The Company will also record an OTTI for equity securities where the decline in the fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary. A corresponding charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and cost basis of the security. The previous cost basis less the impairment becomes the new cost basis. The Company’s evaluation and assumptions used to determine an equity OTTI include, but is not limited to, (a) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on preferred stock dividends and (d) the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery. For the remaining equity securities which are determined to be temporarily impaired, the Company asserts its intent and ability to retain those equity securities until the price recovers.

Estimated maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to security call or prepayment provisions. Due to the potential for variability in payment speeds (i.e. prepayments or extensions), mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are not categorized by contractual maturity.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company aims to maintain a diversified investment portfolio including issuer, sector and geographic stratification, where applicable, and has established certain exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures to mitigate credit risk. The Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government

agencies, the Company’s three largest exposures by issuer were the New York State Dormitory Authority, New York City Transitional Finance Authority, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts which each comprised less than 1% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2016, other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies, the Company’s three largest exposures by issuer were Commonwealth of Massachusetts, New York State Dormitory Authority, and the State of California which each comprised less than 1% of total invested assets. The Company’s three largest exposures by sector as of December 31, 2017 were municipal securities, CMBS, and RMBS which comprised approximately 28%, 7% and 7%, respectively, of total invested assets. The Company’s three largest exposures by sector as of December 31, 2016 were municipal investments, RMBS, and CMBS which comprised approximately 26%, 8% and 7%, respectively, of total invested assets.

As of December 31, 2017, AFS securities in an unrealized loss position consisted of 2,526 securities, primarily in the corporate sector, which were depressed primarily due to an increase in interest rates and/or widening of credit spreads since the securities were purchased. As of December 31, 2017, 96% of these securities were depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The improvement in unrealized losses during 2017 was primarily attributable to tighter credit spreads.
Most of the securities depressed for twelve months or more relate to corporate securities and structured securities with exposure to commercial real estate. Corporate securities and commercial real estate securities were primarily depressed because current market spreads are wider than spreads at the securities' respective purchase dates. Certain other corporate securities were depressed because the securities have floating-rate coupons and have long-dated maturities, and current credit spreads are wider than when these securities were purchased. The Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell the securities outlined in the preceding discussion.

Commercial mortgage loans are considered to be impaired when management estimates that, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to identify potential credit losses. Among other factors, management reviews current and projected macroeconomic trends, such as unemployment rates and property-specific factors such as rental rates, occupancy levels, LTV ratios and debt service coverage ratios (“DSCR”). In addition, the Company considers historical, current and projected delinquency rates and property values. Estimates of collectibility require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability and timing of borrower default and loss severity estimates. In addition, cash flow projections may change based upon new information about the borrower's ability to pay and/or the value of underlying collateral such as changes in projected property value estimates.

For mortgage loans that are deemed impaired, a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. The mortgage loan's estimated fair value is most frequently the Company's share of the fair value of the collateral but may also be the Company’s share of either (a) the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or (b) the loan’s observable market price. A valuation allowance may be recorded for an individual loan or for a group of loans that have an LTV ratio of 90% or greater, a low DSCR or have other lower credit quality characteristics. Changes in valuation allowances are recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. Interest income on impaired loans is accrued to the extent it is deemed collectible and the borrowers continue to make payments under the original or restructured loan terms. The Company stops accruing interest income on loans when it is probable that the Company will not receive interest and principal payments according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The company resumes accruing interest income when it determines that sufficient collateral exists to satisfy the full amount of the loan principal and interest payments and when it is probable cash will be received in the foreseeable future. Interest income on defaulted loans is recognized when received.
As of December 31, 2017, commercial mortgage loans had an amortized cost and carrying value of $3.2 billion. As of December 31, 2016, commercial mortgage loans had an amortized cost and carrying value of $2.9 billion. Amortized cost represents carrying value prior to valuation allowances, if any.
As of December 31, 2017 the carrying value of mortgage loans that had a valuation allowance was $24. As of December 31, 2016, there were no mortgage loans that had a valuation allowance or were held-for-sale. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had an immaterial amount of mortgage loans that have had extensions or restructurings other than what is allowable under the original terms of the contract.
The following table presents the activity within the Company’s valuation allowance for mortgage loans. These loans have been evaluated both individually and collectively for impairment. Loans evaluated collectively for impairment are immaterial.

The weighted-average LTV ratio of the Company’s commercial mortgage loan portfolio was 52% as of December 31, 2017, while the weighted-average LTV ratio at origination of these loans was 61%. LTV ratios compare the loan amount to the value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan. The loan collateral values are updated no less than annually through reviews of the underlying properties. Factors considered in estimating property values include, among other things, actual and expected property

cash flows, geographic market data and the ratio of the property's net operating income to its value. DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to the borrower’s principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , the Company held no delinquent commercial mortgages loan past due by 90 days or more.

Mortgage Servicing
The Company originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans on behalf of third parties and recognizes servicing fees income over the period that services are performed. As of December 31, 2017, under this program, the Company serviced commercial mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal of $1.3 billion, of which $402 was serviced on behalf of third parties, $566 was retained and reported in total investments and $356 was reported in assets held for sale on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2016, under this program the Company serviced commercial mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal balance of $901, of which $251 was serviced on behalf of third parties, $417 was retained and reported in total investments and $233 was reported in assets held for sale on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and were zero as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 because servicing fees were market-level fees at origination and remain adequate to compensate the Company for servicing the loans.
Variable Interest Entities
The Company is engaged with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be VIEs primarily as an investor through normal investment activities but also as an investment manager and previously as a means of accessing capital through a contingent capital facility ("facility").
A VIE is an entity that either has investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as simple majority kick-out rights, or lacks sufficient funds to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities. The Company performs ongoing qualitative assessments of its VIEs to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest when it has both the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the Company’s assessment, if it determines it is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates the VIE in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consolidated VIEs
As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not hold any securities for which it is the primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2016, the Company held one CDO for which it was the primary beneficiary. The CDO represented a structured investment vehicle for which the Company had a controlling financial interest. As of December 31, 2016 the Company held total CDO assets of $5 included in cash with an associated liability of $5 included in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company did not have any additional exposure to loss associated with this investment.
Non-Consolidated VIEs
The Company, through normal investment activities, makes passive investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments. For these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has

determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 is limited to the total carrying value of $920 and $871, respectively, which are included in limited partnerships and other alternative investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $787 and $701, respectively, whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management.
In addition, the Company also makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in ABS, CDOs, CMBS and RMBS in the Available-for-Sale Securities table and fixed maturities, FVO, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company’s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits and the Company’s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company’s investment.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company held a significant variable interest in a VIE for which it was not the primary beneficiary. This VIE represented a contingent capital facility that had been held by the Company since February 2007. Assets and liabilities recorded were $1 and $3, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, as well as a maximum exposure to loss of $3. The Company did not have a controlling financial interest and as such, did not consolidate its variable interest in the facility. As of December 31, 2017, the Company no longer held an interest in the facility. For further information on the facility, see Note 13 of these financial statements.
Securities Lending, Repurchase Agreements and Other Collateral Transactions
The Company enters into securities financing transactions as a way to earn additional income or manage liquidity, primarily through securities lending and repurchase agreements.
Securities Lending
Under a securities lending program, the Company lends certain fixed maturities within the corporate, foreign government/government agencies, and municipal sectors as well as equity securities to qualifying third-party borrowers in return for collateral in the form of cash or securities. For domestic and non-domestic loaned securities, respectively, borrowers provide

F-36

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
6. Investments (continued)

collateral of 102% and 105% of the fair value of the securities lent at the time of the loan. Borrowers will return the securities to the Company for cash or securities collateral at maturity dates generally of 90 days or less. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, except in the event of default by the counterparty, and is not reflected on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additional collateral is obtained if the fair value of the collateral falls below 100% of the fair value of the loaned securities. The agreements provide the counterparty the right to sell or re-pledge the securities loaned. If cash, rather than securities, is received as collateral, the cash is typically invested in short-term investments or fixed maturities and is reported as an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income associated with securities lending transactions is reported as a component of net investment income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Repurchase Agreements
From time to time, the Company enters into repurchase agreements to manage liquidity or to earn incremental income. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which one party (transferor) agrees to sell securities to another party (transferee) in return for cash (or securities), with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same securities at a specified price at a later date. These transactions generally have a contractual maturity of ninety days or less. Repurchase agreements include master netting provisions that provide both counterparties the right to offset claims and apply securities held by them with respect to their obligations in the event of a default. Although the Company has the contractual right to offset claims, the Company's current positions do not meet the specific conditions for net presentation.
Under repurchase agreements, the Company transfers collateral of U.S. government and government agency securities and receives cash. For repurchase agreements, the Company obtains cash in an amount equal to at least 95% of the fair value of the securities transferred. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred when necessary and provide the counterparty the right to sell or re-pledge the securities transferred. The cash received from the repurchase program is typically invested in short-term investments or fixed maturities and is reported as an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company accounts for the repurchase agreements as collateralized borrowings. The securities transferred under repurchase agreements are included in fixed maturities, AFS with the obligation to repurchase those securities recorded in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
From time to time, the Company enters into reverse repurchase agreements where the Company purchases securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same or substantially the same securities. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred to the Company when necessary and the Company has the right to sell or re-pledge the securities received. The Company accounts for reverse repurchase agreements as

collateralized financing.

Other Collateral Transactions
The Company is required by law to deposit securities with government agencies in certain states in which it conducts business. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of securities on deposit was $2.5 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.
As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company has pledged collateral of $104 and $102, respectively, of U.S. government securities and government agency securities or cash primarily related to certain bank loan participations committed to through a limited partnership agreement. These amounts also include collateral related to letters of credit.
For disclosure of collateral in support of derivative transactions, refer to the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section of Note 7 of these financial statements.
Equity Method Investments
The majority of the Company's investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, including hedge funds, real estate funds, and private equity funds (collectively, “limited partnerships”), are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The remainder of investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments consists primarily of investments in insurer-owned life insurance accounted for at cash surrender value. For those limited partnerships and other alternative investments accounted for under the equity method, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2017 is limited to the total carrying value of $1.2 billion. In addition, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $829 to fund limited partnership and other alternative investments as of December 31, 2017. The Company’s investments in limited partnerships are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in the

management of the limited partnerships. In 2017, aggregate investment income from limited partnerships and other alternative investments exceeded 10% of the Company’s pre-tax consolidated net income (loss). Accordingly, the Company is disclosing aggregated summarized financial data for the Company’s limited partnership investments. This aggregated summarized financial data does not represent the Company’s proportionate share of limited partnership assets or earnings. Aggregate total assets of the limited partnerships in which the Company invested totaled $165.9 billion and $93.7 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Aggregate total liabilities of the limited partnerships in which the Company invested totaled $47.8 billion and $13.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Aggregate net investment income of the limited partnerships in which the Company invested totaled $1.9 billion, $844, and $914 for the periods ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Aggregate net income of the limited partnerships in which the Company invested totaled $9.8 billion, $7.7 billion and $6.5 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of, and for the period ended, December 31, 2017, the aggregated summarized financial data reflects the latest available financial information.

7. Derivatives

The Company utilizes a variety of OTC, OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivative instruments as a part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk associated with interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread, issuer default, price, and currency exchange rate risk or volatility. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies.
Strategies that Qualify for Hedge Accounting
Some of the Company's derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements as outlined in Note 1 of these financial statements. Typically, these hedging instruments include interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency swaps where the terms or expected cash flows of the hedged item closely match the terms of the swap. The interest rate swaps are typically used to manage interest rate duration of certain fixed maturity securities. The hedge strategies by hedge accounting designation include:
Cash Flow Hedges
Interest rate swaps are predominantly used to manage portfolio duration and better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities. These derivatives primarily convert interest receipts on floating-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates. In addition, during 2017, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to convert the variable interest payments on junior subordinated debt to fixed interest payments. For further information, see the Junior Subordinated Debentures section within Note 13 of these financial statements.
The Company also enters into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure related to the future purchase of fixed-rate securities, primarily to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain group benefits liabilities.
Foreign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency-denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts and liability payments to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates.
Non-qualifying Strategies
Derivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting (“non-qualifying strategies”) primarily include hedging and replication strategies that utilize credit default swaps. In addition, hedges of interest rate, foreign currency and equity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities do not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying strategies include:
Credit Contracts
Credit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company to pay or receive a periodic fee in exchange

for compensation from the counterparty should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. In addition, the Company enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.
Interest Rate Swaps, Swaptions and Futures
The Company uses interest rate swaps, swaptions and futures to manage interest rate duration between assets and liabilities in certain investment portfolios. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps to terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the notional amount of interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships was $7.3 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively.
Foreign Currency Swaps and Forwards
The Company enters into foreign currency swaps to convert the foreign currency exposures of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity investments to U.S. dollars. The Company also enters into foreign currency forwards to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash and, previously, equity securities. In addition, the Company previously entered into foreign currency forwards to hedge currency impacts on changes in equity of the U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries that were sold in May 2017. For further information on the disposition, see Note 2 of these financial statements.
Equity Index Options
The Company enters into equity index options to hedge the impact of a decline in the equity markets on the investment portfolio. The Company previously entered into total return swaps to hedge equity risk of specific common stock investments which were accounted for using fair value option in order to align the accounting treatment within net realized capital gains (losses). The Company has not held these total return swaps since January 2016.
Commodity Contracts
The Company previously used put options contracts on oil futures to partially offset potential losses related to certain fixed maturity securities that could be impacted by changes in oil prices. These options were terminated at the end of 2015.
Contingent Capital Facility Put Option
The Company previously entered into a put option agreement that provided the Company the right to require a third-party trust to purchase, at any time, The Hartford’s junior subordinated notes in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $500. On February 8, 2017, The Hartford exercised the put option resulting in the issuance of $500 in junior subordinated notes with proceeds received on February 15, 2017. Under the put option agreement, The Hartford had been paying premiums on a periodic basis and had agreed to reimburse the trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses. For further information on the put option agreement, see the Contingent Capital Facility section within Note 13 of these financial statements.

Derivative Balance Sheet Classification
For reporting purposes, the Company has elected to offset within assets or liabilities based upon the net of the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset. The following fair value amounts do not include income accruals or related cash collateral receivables and payables,

which are netted with derivative fair value amounts to determine balance sheet presentation. Derivative fair value reported as liabilities after taking into account the master netting agreements was $100 and $112 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company’s derivative instruments are held for risk management purposes, unless otherwise noted in the following table. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and is presented in the table to quantify the volume of the Company’s derivative activity. Notional amounts are not necessarily reflective of credit risk.

Cash Flow Hedges
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current period earnings. All components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the Company had no ineffectiveness recognized in income within net realized capital gains (losses).
As of December 31, 2017, the before-tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments recorded in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are $86. This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities that will occur over the next twelve months, at which time the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an adjustment to net investment income over the term of the investment cash flows. The maximum term over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability of future cash flows for forecasted transactions, excluding interest payments on existing variable-rate financial instruments, is less than one year.
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company had no net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.
Non-qualifying Strategies
For non-qualifying strategies, including embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from their host contracts and accounted for as derivatives, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings within net realized capital gains (losses).

Credit Risk Assumed through Credit Derivatives
The Company enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk of a single entity or referenced index in order to synthetically replicate investment transactions that are permissible under the Company's investment policies. The Company will receive periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount and will only make a payment if there is a credit event. A credit event payment will typically be equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security

issuer’s debt obligation after the occurrence of the credit event. A credit event is generally defined as a default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity. The credit default swaps in which the Company assumes credit risk primarily reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include standard diversified portfolios of corporate and CMBS issuers. The diversified portfolios of corporate issuers are established within sector concentration limits and may be divided into tranches that possess different credit ratings.

respectively, which have been included in fixed maturities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The counterparties have the right to sell or re-pledge these securities.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company accepted cash collateral associated with derivative instruments of $11 and $53, respectively, which was invested and recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in fixed maturities and short-term investments with corresponding amounts recorded in other investments or other liabilities as determined by the Company's election to offset on the balance sheet. The Company also accepted securities collateral as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 with a fair value of $2 and $2, respectively, none of which the Company has the ability to sell or repledge. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had no repledged securities and did not sell any securities. In addition, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, non-cash collateral accepted was held in separate custodial accounts and was not included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

8. Reinsurance

The Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers to enable the Company to manage capital and risk exposure. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company's procedures include carefully selecting its reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where necessary, and regularly monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers.
In December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an asbestos and environmental adverse development cover (“ADC”) reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”), to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves. Under the ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion.  The $650 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. As of December 31, 2016, other liabilities included $650 for the accrued reinsurance premium. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions.  The ADC covers substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.
The ADC has been accounted for as retroactive reinsurance and the Company reported the $650 cost as a loss on reinsurance transaction in 2016 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For segment reporting, the loss on reinsurance was reported in Property and Casualty Other Operations. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse asbestos and environmental reserve development after December 31, 2016 will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5

billion limit.  Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred.  Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has incurred $285 in adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the ADC treaty with NICO.
Reinsurance Recoverables
Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross losses and loss adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of losses and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent with those used in establishing the gross reserves for amounts the Company owes to its claimants. The Company estimates its ceded reinsurance recoverables based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how incurred but not reported losses will ultimately be ceded under reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

[2] No allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was required as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The Company analyzes recent developments in

commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. Based on this analysis, the Company may

8. Reinsurance (continued)

adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets.
Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance

recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.
Insurance Revenues
The effect of reinsurance on insurance revenues is as follows:

Reinsurance assumed 446 107 97
Reinsurance ceded (50 ) (44 ) (68 )
Net earned premiums, fees and other considerations $ 3,677 $ 3,223 $ 3,136

For its group benefits products, the Company reinsures certain of its risks to other reinsurers under yearly renewable term, coinsurance arrangements and variations thereto. Yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements result in passing all or a portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer receives a proportionate amount of the premiums less an allowance for commissions and expenses and is liable for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments. The increase in premiums assumed in 2017 was primarily due to premiums related to Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business acquired by the Company effective November 1, 2017 whereby Aetna is fronting the business for a period of time.

Range of discount rates 1.77 % - 14.15 % 1.77 % - 14.15 % 1.77 % - 14.15 %

The current accident year benefit from discounting property and casualty insurance product reserves was $15 in 2017, $27 in 2016 and $35 in 2015. The reduction in the discount benefit in 2017 as compared to 2016 and in 2016 as compared to 2015 reflects lower claim volume and a shorter than expected payment pattern. Reserves are discounted at rates in effect at the time claims were incurred, ranging from 1.77% for accident year 2012 to 14.15% for accident year 1981.
The reserves recorded for the Company’s property and casualty insurance products at December 31, 2017 represent the Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant

uncertainties surrounding reserves it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company’s results of operations or cash flows.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses are also impacted by trends including frequency and severity as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment. In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in the ultimate settlement of the liabilities gross of reinsurance include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks

inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in gross reserves include expanding theories of liabilities and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

2017 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Workers’ compensation reserves were reduced in Small Commercial and Middle Market, given the continued emergence of favorable frequency, primarily for accident years 2013 to 2015, as well as a reduction in estimated reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses ("ULAE"), partially offset by strengthening reserves for captive programs within Specialty Commercial.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• General liability reserves were increased for the 2013 to 2016 accident years on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in recent accident year reserves for other Middle Market general liability reserves.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Package business reserves were reduced for accident years 2013 and prior largely due to reducing the Company’s estimate of allocated loss adjustment expenses incurred to settle the claims.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Bond business reserves increased for customs bonds written between 2000 and 2010 which was partly offset by a reduction in reserves for recent accident years as reported losses for commercial and contract surety have emerged favorably.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Automobile liability reserves within Commercial Lines were increased in Small Commercial and large national accounts for the 2013 to 2016 accident years, driven by higher frequency of more severe accidents, including litigated claims.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asbestos and environmental reserves were unchanged as $285 of adverse development arising from the fourth quarter 2017 comprehensive annual review was offset by a $285 recoverable from NICO. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see Note 8 - Reinsurance and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Catastrophes reserves were reduced primarily due to lower estimates of 2016 wind and hail event losses and a decrease in losses on a 2015 wildfire.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Uncollectible reinsurance reserves decreased as a result of giving greater weight to favorable collectibility experience in recent calendar periods in estimating future collections.

2016 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Workers' compensation reserves consider favorable emergence on reported losses for recent accident years as well as a partially offsetting adverse impact related to two recent Florida Supreme Court rulings that have increased the Company’s exposure to workers’ compensation claims in that state. The favorable emergence has been driven by lower frequency and, to a lesser extent, lower medical severity and management has placed additional weight on this favorable experience as it becomes more credible.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• General liability reserves increased for accident years 2012 - 2015 primarily due to higher severity losses incurred on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors and increased reserves in general liability for accident years 2008 and 2010 primarily due to indemnity losses and legal costs associated with a litigated claim.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Package business reserves increased due to higher than expected severity on liability claims, principally for accident years 2013 - 2015. Severity for these accident years has developed unfavorably and management has placed more weight on emerged experience.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Professional liability reserves decreased for claims made years 2008 - 2013, primarily for large accounts, including on non-securities class action cases. Claim costs have emerged favorably as these years have matured and management has placed more weight on the emerged experience.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Automobile liability reserves increased due to increases in both commercial lines automobile and personal lines automobile. Commercial automobile liability reserves increased, predominately for the 2015 accident year, primarily due to increased frequency of large claims. Personal automobile liability reserves increased, primarily related to increased bodily injury frequency and severity for the 2015 accident year, including for uninsured and under-insured motorist claims, and increased bodily injury severity for the 2014 accident year. Increases in automobile liability loss costs were across both the direct and agency distribution channels.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asbestos and environmental reserves were increased during the period as a result of the second quarter 2016 comprehensive annual review.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Uncollectible reinsurance reserves decreased as a result of giving greater weight to favorable collectibility experience in recent calendar periods in estimating future collections.

2015 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Workers' compensation reserves decreased due to an improvement in claim closure rates resulting in a decrease in outstanding claims for permanently disabled

claimants. In addition, accident years 2013 and 2014 continue to exhibit favorable frequency and medical severity trends; management has been placing additional weight on this favorable experience as it becomes more credible.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Package business reserves increased due to higher than expected severity on liability claims, impacting recent accident years.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Professional liability reserves decreased for claims made years 2009 through 2012 primarily for large accounts. Claim costs have emerged favorably as these years have matured and management has placed more weight on the emerged experience.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Automobile liability reserves within Commercial Lines were increased due to increased severity of large claims predominantly for accident years 2010 to 2013.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asbestos and environmental reserves were increased during the period as a result of the 2015 comprehensive annual review.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Catastrophe reserves decreased primarily for accident year 2014 as fourth quarter 2014 catastrophes have developed favorably.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Other reserve re-estimates, net, decreased due to decreased contract surety reserves across several accident years and decreased commercial surety reserves for accident years 2012 through 2014 as a result of lower emerged losses. These reserve decreases were offset by an increase in commercial surety reserves related to accident years 2007 and prior, as the number of new claims reported has outpaced expectations.

[1] Amounts represent reserves for claims that were incurred more than ten years ago for long-tail lines and more than three years ago for short-tail lines.

[2] Asbestos and environmental and other operations include asbestos, environmental and other latent exposures not foreseen when coverages were written, including, but not limited to, potential liability for pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries, lead paint, construction defects, molestation and other long-tail liabilities. These reserve lines do not have significant paid or incurred loss development for the most recent ten accident years and therefore do not have loss development displayed in triangles.

The reserve lines in the above table and the loss triangles that follow represent the significant lines of business for which the Company regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels. These reserve lines differ from the reserve lines reported on a statutory basis, as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC").
The following loss triangles present historical loss development for incurred and paid claims by accident year. Triangles are limited

to the number of years for which claims incurred typically remain outstanding, not exceeding ten years. Short-tail lines, which represent claims generally expected to be paid within a few years, have three years of claim development displayed. IBNR reserves shown in loss triangles include reserve for incurred but not reported claims as well as reserves for expected development on reported claims.

Property and casualty reserves, including IBNR reserves
The Company estimates ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses by accident year. IBNR represents the excess of estimated ultimate loss reserves over case reserves. The process to estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses is an integral part of the Company's reserve setting. Reserves for allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are generally established separate from the reserves for losses.
Reserves for losses are set by line of business within the reporting segments. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information

becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company’s shortest tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property and automobile physical damage. The longest tail lines of business include workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given

accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.
The Company’s reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. A variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. While actuarial methods used and judgments change depending on the age of the accident year, in 2017, there were no new methods or types of judgments introduced or changes in how those methods and judgments were applied. The reserve selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates.
For both short-tail and long-tail lines of business, an expected loss ratio is used to record initial reserves. This expected loss ratio is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period. For certain short-tailed lines of business, IBNR amounts in the above loss development triangles are negative due to anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries on paid losses.
As losses for a given accident year emerge or develop in subsequent periods, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the expected loss ratio method. These primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency / severity techniques and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the expected loss ratio and paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more weight vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and

external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to as the “actuarial indication”.
Paid development and reported development techniques are used for most lines of business though more weight is given to the reported development method for some of the long-tailed lines like general liability. In addition, for long-tailed lines of business, the Company relies on the expected loss ratio method for immature accident years. Frequency/severity techniques are used predominantly for professional liability and are also used for automobile liability. For most lines, reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses ("ALAE", or those expenses related to specific claims) are analyzed using paid development techniques and an analysis of the relationship between ALAE and loss payments. Reserves for ULAE are determined using the expected cost per claim year and the anticipated claim closure pattern as well as the ratio of paid ULAE to paid losses.
In the final step of the reserve review process, senior reserving actuaries and senior management apply their judgment to determine the appropriate level of reserves considering the actuarial indications and other factors not contemplated in the actuarial indications. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions used in the current actuarial indications, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications.
Cumulative number of reported claims
For property and casualty, claim counts represent the number of claim features on a reported claim where a claim feature is each separate coverage for each claimant affected by the claim event.  For example, one car accident that results in two bodily injury claims and one automobile damage liability claim would be counted as three claims within the personal automobile liability triangle. Similarly, a fire that impacts one commercial building may result in multiple claim features due to the potential for claims related to business interruption, structural damage, and loss of the physical contents of the building. Claim features that result in no paid losses are included in the reported claim counts.

Reserves are discounted at rates in effect at the time claims were incurred, ranging from 2.1% for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017, to 8.0% for the Company’s pre-acquisition reserves for incurral year 1990, and vary by product. Prior year's discount accretion has been calculated as the average reserve balance for the year times the weighted average discount rate. The decrease in the weighted average discount rate for 2017 was primarily due to the fact that reserves for the Aetna U.S. group life and disability business are discounted at market rates in effect as of the acquisition date.
Re-estimates of prior incurral years reserves in 2017 was driven by the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group Disability- Prior period estimates decreased by approximately $125 driven by group long-term disability favorable claim incidence for incurral year 2016 and claim recoveries higher than prior reserve assumptions.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group Life and Accident (including Group Life Premium Waiver)- Contributing to an approximately $60 decrease in prior period reserve estimates was favorable claim incidence on group life premium waiver for incurral year 2016.

Re-estimates of prior incurral years reserves in 2016 was driven by the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group Disability- Prior period estimates decreased by approximately $90 largely driven by group long-term disability claim recoveries higher than prior reserve assumptions, particularly in the older incurral years. This favorability was partially offset by lower Social Security Disability approvals driven by lower approval rates and backlogs in the Social Security Administration.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group Life and Accident (including Group Life Premium Waiver)- Contributing to an approximately $75 decrease in prior period reserve estimates was favorable claim incidence on group life premium waiver for incurral year 2015.

Re-estimates of prior incurral years reserves in 2015 was driven by the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group Disability- Prior period estimates decreased by approximately $90 largely driven by updated assumptions related to the probability and timing of long-term disability claim recoveries, which were updated to reflect recent favorable trends. This favorability was partially offset by lower approval rates and backlogs in the Social Security Administration.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Group Life and Accident (including Group Life Premium Waiver- Prior period estimates decreased by approximately $50 largely driven by favorable claim incidence and recovery experience on group life premium waiver.

Group life, disability and accident reserves, including IBNR
The majority of Group Benefits’ reserves are for long-term disability ("LTD") claimants who are known to be disabled and are

currently receiving benefits. A Disabled Life Reserve ("DLR") is calculated for each LTD claim. The DLR for each claim is the expected present value of all estimated future benefit payments and includes estimates of claim recovery, investment yield, and offsets from other income, including offsets from Social Security benefits and workers’ compensation. Estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. Claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. The DLR also includes a liability for payments to claimants who have not yet been approved for LTD either because they have not yet satisfied the waiting (or elimination) period or because the approval or denial decision has not yet been made. In these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of claim denial based on Company experience. For claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the DLR is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability.  In addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the DLR.
For incurral years with IBNR claims, estimates of ultimate losses are made by applying completion factors to the dollar amount of claims reported or expected depending on the market segment. IBNR represents estimated ultimate losses less both DLR and cumulative paid amounts for all reported claims. Completion factors are derived using standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. The IBNR includes an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.
For all products, including LTD, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and market segment, where emerged claim information for an incurral year is not yet credible enough to be a basis for an IBNR projection.  In

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATMENTS (continued)
11. Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (continued)

these cases, the ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses are estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio.
The Company also records reserves for future death benefits under group term life policies that provide for premiums to be waived in the event the insured has a permanent and total disablement and has satisfied an elimination period, which is typically nine months ("premium waiver reserves"). The death benefit reserve for these group life premium waiver claims is estimated for a known disabled claimant equal to the present value of expected future cash outflows (typically a lump sum face amount payable at death plus claim expenses) with separate estimates for claimant recovery (when no death benefit is payable) and for death before recovery or benefit expiry (when death benefit is payable). The IBNR for premium waiver death benefits is estimated with standard actuarial development methods.

In addition, the Company also records reserves for group term life, accidental death & dismemberment, short term disability, and other group products that have short claim payout periods. For these products, reserves are determined using paid or reported actuarial development methods. The resulting claim triangles produce a completion pattern and estimate of ultimate loss. IBNR for these lines of business equals the estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses less the amount of paid or reported claims depending on whether the paid or reported development method was used. Estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends or other factors that affect the development pattern.
Cumulative number of reported claims
For group life, disability and accident coverages, claim counts include claims that are approved, pending approval and terminated and exclude denied claims. Due to the nature of the claims, one claimant represents one event.

[7] In April, 2017 the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement expiring February 15, 2027 to effectively convert the interest payments for the 3 month Libor + 2.125% debenture into fixed interest payments of approximately 4.39%.

The debentures are unsecured, subordinated and junior in right of payment and upon liquidation to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. In addition, the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including obligations to policyholders. The debentures do not limit the Company’s or the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, including debt that ranks senior in right of payment and upon liquidation to the debentures.
The Company has the right to defer interest payments for up to ten consecutive years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will continue to accrue and will accrue additional interest at the then applicable interest rate. If the Company defers interest payments, the Company generally may not make payments on or redeem or purchase any shares of its capital stock or any of its debt securities or guarantees that rank upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up equally with or junior to the debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions. If the Company defers interest on the 8.125% and 3 month Libor plus 2.125% debentures for five consecutive years or, if earlier, pays current interest during a deferral period, the Company will be required to pay deferred interest from proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying securities.
The 7.875% , 8.125% and 3 month Libor plus 2.125% debentures may be redeemed in whole prior to the call date upon certain tax or rating agency events, at a price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed and the applicable make-whole amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may elect to redeem the 8.125% debentures in whole or part at its option prior to the call date at a price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed and the

applicable make-whole amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may elect to redeem the 7.875% , 8.125% and 3 month Libor plus 2.125% debentures in whole or in part on or after the call date for the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
In connection with the offering of the 8.125% debentures, the Company entered into a replacement capital covenant ("RCC") for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company's indebtedness, initially the Company’s 6.1% notes due 2041. Under the terms of the RCC, if the Company redeems the 8.125% debentures at any time prior to June 15, 2048 it can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities. On February 7, 2017, the Company executed an amendment to the RCC to lengthen the amount of time the Company has to issue qualifying replacement securities prior to the redemption of the 8.125% debentures and to amend the definition of certain qualifying replacement securities. The 3 month Libor plus 2.125% debentures are qualifying replacement securities within the definition of the RCC, as amended.
In connection with the offering of the three month LIBOR plus 2.125% debenture, the Company entered into a RCC for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company's indebtedness, initially the Company's 4.3% notes due 2043. Under the terms of the RCC, if the Company redeems the debenture any time prior to February 12, 2047 (or such earlier date on which the RCC terminates by its terms) it can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities. The RCC also prohibits the Company from redeeming all or any portion of the notes on or prior to February 15, 2022.
In April, 2017 the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement expiring February 15, 2027 to effectively convert the variable interest payments for the 3 month Libor plus 2.125% debenture into fixed interest payments of approximately 4.39%.

Shelf Registrations
On July 29, 2016, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-212778) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. In that The Hartford is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the registration statement went

effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the three-year life of the registration statement.
Contingent Capital Facility
The Hartford was party to a put option agreement that provided The Hartford with the right to require the Glen Meadow ABC Trust, a Delaware statutory trust, at any time and from time to time, to purchase The Hartford's junior subordinated notes in a maximum aggregate principal amount not to exceed $500. On February 8, 2017, The Hartford exercised the put option resulting in the issuance of $500 in junior subordinated notes with proceeds received on February 15, 2017. Under the Put Option Agreement, The Hartford had been paying the Glen Meadow ABC Trust premiums on a periodic basis, calculated with respect to the aggregate principal amount of notes that The Hartford had the right to put to the Glen Meadow ABC Trust for such period. The Hartford agreed to reimburse the Glen Meadow ABC Trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses. Up until the Company exercised the put option, the Company held a variable interest in the Glen Meadow ABC Trust where the Company was not the primary beneficiary. As a result, the Company did not consolidate the Glen Meadow ABC Trust.
The junior subordinated notes have a scheduled maturity of February 12, 2047, and a final maturity of February 12, 2067. As noted in the table above, the Company is required to use reasonable efforts to sell certain qualifying replacement securities in order to repay the debentures at the scheduled maturity date. The junior subordinated notes bear interest at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.125%, payable quarterly, and are unsecured, subordinated indebtedness of The Hartford.
Revolving Credit Facilities
The Company has a senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that provides for borrowing capacity up to $1 billion of unsecured credit through October 31, 2019 available in U.S. dollars, Euro, Sterling, Canadian dollars and Japanese Yen. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants within the Credit Facility.
Commercial Paper
The Hartford’s maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program are $1 billion. The Company is dependent upon market conditions to access short-term financing through the issuance of commercial paper to investors. As of December 31, 2017, there was no commercial paper outstanding.

14. Commitments and Contingencies

Management evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes liabilities for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated liability at the low end of the range of losses.
Litigation
The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties in the following discussion under the caption “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.
The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, and in addition to the matters in the following discussion, putative state and federal class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, disability, life and inland marine. The Hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims or other allegedly unfair or improper business practices. Like many other insurers, The Hartford also has been joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs asserting, among other things, that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos and that insurers committed unfair trade practices by asserting defenses on behalf of their policyholders in the underlying asbestos cases. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, the outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
In addition to the inherent difficulty of predicting litigation outcomes, the Mutual Funds Litigation identified below purports to seek substantial damages for unsubstantiated conduct spanning a multi-year period based on novel applications of complex legal theories. The alleged damages are not quantified or factually supported in the complaint, and, in any event, the Company's experience shows that demands for damages often bear little relation to a reasonable estimate of potential loss. The application of the legal standard identified by the court for assessing the potentially available damages, as described below, is inherently unpredictable, and no legal precedent has been

identified that would aid in determining a reasonable estimate of potential loss. Accordingly, management cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any.
Mutual Funds Litigation
In February 2011, a derivative action was brought on behalf of six Hartford retail mutual funds in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Hartford Investment Financial Services, LLC (“HIFSCO”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company, received excessive advisory and distribution fees in violation of its statutory fiduciary duty under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  During the course of the litigation, the claims regarding distribution fees were dismissed without prejudice, the lineup of funds as plaintiffs changed several times, and the plaintiffs added as a defendant Hartford Funds Management Company(“HFMC”), an indirect subsidiary of the Company that assumed the role of advisor to the funds as of January 2013. In June 2015, HFMC and HIFSCO moved for summary judgment, and plaintiffs cross-moved for partial summary judgment with respect to one fund. In March 2016, the court denied the plaintiff's motion, and granted summary judgment for HIFSCO and HFMC with respect to one fund, leaving six funds as plaintiffs: The Hartford Balanced Fund, The Hartford Capital Appreciation Fund, The Hartford Floating Rate Fund, The Hartford Growth Opportunities Fund, The Hartford Healthcare Fund, and The Hartford Inflation Plus Fund. The court further ruled that the appropriate measure of damages on the surviving claims would be the difference, if any, between the actual advisory fees paid through trial and the fees permitted under the applicable legal standard. A bench trial on the issue of liability was held in November 2016. In February 2017, the court granted judgment for HIFSCO and HFMC as to all claims. Plaintiffs have appealed to the United State Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Asbestos and Environmental Claims
The Company continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.
The Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover asbestos and environmental claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess and umbrella policies providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage. Third, the Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing primary, excess, umbrella and reinsurance coverages. Fourth, subsidiaries of the Company participated in the London Market, writing both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business.
Significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid gross losses and expenses related to environmental and particularly asbestos claims. The degree of variability of gross reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
14. Commitments and Contingencies (continued)

In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. Plaintiffs and insureds also have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.
In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.
The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to asbestos and environmental claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.
It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims.
Given the factors described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures. For this reason, the Company principally relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these claims, both gross and net of reinsurance, and regularly evaluates new account information in assessing its potential asbestos and environmental exposures. The Company supplements this exposure-based analysis with evaluations of the Company’s historical direct net loss and expense paid and reported experience, and net loss and expense paid and reported experience by calendar and/or report year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity.
While the Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not estimable

now, could be material to The Hartford's consolidated operating results and liquidity.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company reported $1.2 billion of net asbestos reserves and $237 of net environmental reserves. While the Company believes that its current asbestos and environmental reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not reasonably estimable now, could be material to The Hartford's consolidated operating results and liquidity.
Effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves. Under the ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net asbestos and environmental reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse asbestos and environmental reserve development after December 31, 2016 will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. Furthermore, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims could ultimately exceed the $1.5 billion treaty limit in which case any adverse development in excess of the treaty limit would be absorbed as a charge to earnings by the Company. In these scenarios, the effect of these changes could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results and liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has incurred $285 in adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the ADC treaty with NICO.

Lease Commitments
The total rental expense on operating leases was $57, $53, and $60 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which excludes sublease rental income of $3, $2, and $3 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Company’s lease commitments consist primarily of lease agreements for office space, automobiles, and office equipment that expire at various dates.

Unfunded Commitments
As of December 31, 2017, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $989 million, of which $829 million is committed to fund limited partnership and other alternative investments, which may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. Additionally, $54 of the outstanding commitments relate to various funding obligations associated with private placement securities. The remaining outstanding commitments of $106 relate to mortgage loans the Company is expecting to fund in the first half of 2018.

Guaranty Funds and Other Insurance-Related Assessments
In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state, the guaranty funds may assess its members to pay covered claims of the insolvent insurers. Assessments are based on each member's proportionate share of written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of the premiums written per year depending on the state. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets, while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process.
Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of

December 31, 2017 and 2016 the liability balance was $113 and $126, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 amounts related to premium tax offsets of $6 and $19, respectively, were included in other assets.

Derivative Commitments
Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2017 was $534. Of this $534, the legal entities have posted collateral of $609, which is inclusive of initial margin requirements, in the normal course of business. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2017, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2017, a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would require additional $10 of assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the collateral that we post, when required, is primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.

Guarantees
In the ordinary course of selling businesses or entities to third parties, the Company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising subsequent to the closing due to breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business or entity being sold or with respect to covenants and obligations of the Company and/or its subsidiaries. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. The Company does not expect to make any payments on these guarantees and is not carrying any liabilities associated with these guarantees.

15. Equity

Capital Purchase Program ("CPP") Warrants
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the Company has 2.2 million and 4.0 million CPP warrants outstanding and exercisable. The CPP warrants were issued in 2009 as part of a program established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The CPP warrants expire in June 2019.
CPP warrant exercises were 1.8 million, 0.4 million and 2.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The declaration of common stock dividends by the Company in excess of a threshold triggers a provision in the Company's warrant agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon resulting in adjustments to the CPP warrant exercise price. Accordingly, the CPP warrant exercise price was $8.999, $9.126 and $9.264 as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The exercise price will be settled by the Company withholding the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants equal to the value of the aggregate exercise price of the warrants so exercised determined by reference to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the trading day on which the warrants are exercised and notice is delivered to the warrant agent.
Equity Repurchase Program
In October 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a new equity repurchase program for $1.3 billion for the period commencing October 31, 2016 through December 31, 2017. The $1.3 billion authorization is in addition to the Company's prior authorization for $4.375 billion, which was completed by December 31, 2016.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 20.2 million common shares for $1,028. Effective October 13, 2017 the Company suspended 2017 equity repurchases. The Company does not currently expect to authorize an equity repurchase plan in 2018.

Statutory Results
The domestic insurance subsidiaries of The Hartford prepare their statutory financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance department which vary materially from U.S. GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, predominately use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the NAIC for life benefit reserves, generally carry bonds at amortized cost, and present reinsurance assets and liabilities net of reinsurance. For reporting purposes, statutory capital and surplus is referred to collectively as "statutory capital". Life insurance subsidaries include the

Company's group benefits subsidiary, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (HLA) and the Company's run-off life and annuity subsidiaries held for sale.

Total $ 12,977 $ 14,283

Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company's total adjusted capital (“TAC”) to its authorized control level RBC (“ACL RBC”). Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences (“Company Action Level”) is two times the ACL RBC. The adequacy of a company's capital is determined by the ratio of a company's TAC to its Company Action Level, known as the "RBC ratio". All of the Company's operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations. On an aggregate basis, the Company's U.S. property and casualty insurance companies' RBC ratio was in excess of 200% of its Company Action Level as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The RBC ratios for the Company's group benefits insurance operating subsidiary (HLA) was in excess of 300% of its Company Action Level as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The RBC ratio of the Company's held for sale life insurance and annuity run-off entities was in excess of 300% of its respective Company Action Levels as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The reporting of RBC ratios is not intended for the purpose of ranking any insurance company, or for use in connection with any marketing, advertising, or promotional activities.

15. Equity (continued)

Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries have solvency margins in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.
Dividend Restrictions
Dividends to the HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed commercially domiciled under applicable state insurance laws contain similar or in certain state(s) more restrictive limitations on the payment of dividends. In addition, if any dividend of a domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer's earned surplus or certain other thresholds as calculated under applicable state insurance law, the dividend requires the prior approval of the domestic regulator. Dividends paid to HFSG Holding Company by its life insurance subsidiaries are further dependent on cash requirements of Hartford Life, Inc. ("HLI"), the holding company of its life and annuity run-off business held for sale, and Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company ("HLA") and other factors. Dividends paid to HFSG from HLI are subject to provisions of the Stock and Asset Purchase agreement related to the sale of HLI and its run-off life and annuity insurance business and provides for expected dividends from HLI of $300 prior to closing of the sale, subject to regulatory approval. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiary, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.
Total dividends received by HFSG in 2017 from its P&C insurance subsidiaries were $2.4 billion. In connection with the purchase of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business in the fourth quarter of 2017, the P&C insurance subsidiaries received approval and paid an extraordinary dividend to the HFSG Holding Company of $1.4 billion, of which $800 was funded by approved extraordinary dividends from HLIC. The $800 of extraordinary dividends from HLIC was used to pay down principal on the intercompany note owed by Hartford Holdings, Inc. (HHI) to Hartford Fire Insurance Company. In addition, $100 of Hartford Fire Insurance Company dividends were subsequently contributed to a run-off P&C subsidiary and $63 of P&C insurance subsidiary dividends relate to principal and interest payments on an intercompany note owed by HHI to Hartford Fire Insurance

Company. Accordingly, the net dividend to HFSG Holding Company for the 2017 full year from P&C insurance subsidiaries was approximately $1.5 billion.
The $800 of extraordinary dividends from HLIC were funded in part by $550 of extraordinary dividends from HLIC's indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company.
Total net dividends received by HFSG from subsidiaries in 2017 were $3.1 billion, including the $1.5 billion of net dividends from P&C subsidiaries, $1.4 billion from HLIC, $188 from HLA and $75 from Mutual Funds
In 2018, The Company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.4 billion in dividends to HFSG Holding Company without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. In 2018, HFSG Holding Company anticipates receiving net dividends of approximately $350 from its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries.
In 2018, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company ("HLA") has no dividend capacity for 2018 and does not anticipate paying dividends to the HSFG Holding Company.
On December 4, 2017, The Hartford announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its life and annuity run-off businesses to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safra Group. Up until the anticipated close of the sale, HLIC does not have any additional dividend capacity. Prior to the expected close in 2018, HSFG Holding company anticipates receiving $300 of dividends from HLIC through HLI, subject to approval by the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner. Other intercompany transactions with HLI will be net settled prior to closing.
There are no current restrictions on the HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.
Restricted Net Assets
The Company's insurance subsidiaries had net assets of $16 billion, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, that were restricted from payment to the HFSG Holding Company, without prior regulatory approval at December 31, 2017.

16. Income Taxes

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions, as applicable. Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $704, $521 and $1,517 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and income (losses) from foreign operations of $19, $(74) and $(39) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”). Tax Reform establishes new tax laws that will affect 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, (3) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, (4) changes to the discounting of statutory reserves for tax purposes, and (5) limitations on net operating losses (NOLs) generated after December 31, 2017 though there is no impact to the Company’s current NOL carryforwards.
In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of Tax Reform, the Company recorded a provisional net income tax expense of $877 in the period ending December 31, 2017. This net expense consists of a $821 reduction of The Company’s deferred tax assets primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and a $56 sequestration fee payable associated with refundable AMT credits. Net of the sequestration fee payable, the Company's AMT credits of $790 have been reclassified to a current income tax receivable. Tax reform allows for the refund of AMT credits over time but no later than 2022.
For components where we have made provisional estimates of the impact of Tax Reform, future guidance could change these estimates, particularly the estimated amount of sequestration fee payable. Adjustments to income tax expense, if any, will be made in the period the adjustments become known in 2018.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets represent the tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 shown

in the table below reflect the reduction in deferred taxes required as a result of Tax Reform.  In addition, as a result of entering into a definitive agreement to sell the life and annuity run-off business, deferred tax balances that will be transferred to the buyer have been removed from the following table and are included in assets held for sale.  Included in deferred taxes as of December 31, 2017 are deferred tax assets of the life and annuity run-off business that will be retained by the Company, including $437 for the tax effect of net operating loss carryovers, and $23 of foreign tax credits. While the Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $3.3 billion on the sale of the life and annuity run-off business in 2017, the Company did not record a tax benefit on the sale.  Rather the Company plans to elect to retain tax net operating loss carryovers in lieu of recognizing a tax capital loss in 2018.

[1]As of December 31, 2017, alternative minimum tax credits of $790 have been reclassified as a current tax receivable. See further discussion below.
A deferred tax valuation allowance has not been recorded because the Company believes the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. From time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, altering the level of tax exempt securities held, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. Management views such tax

planning strategies as prudent and feasible and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.

As shown in the deferred tax assets (liabilities) table above, included in net deferred income taxes are the future tax benefits associated with the net operating loss carryover, foreign tax credit carryover, capital loss carryover, alternative minimum tax credit carryover, and general business credit carryover.

Alternative minimum tax credit carryover $ 790 $ 790 No expiration $ —
General business credit carryover $ 3 $ 3 2031 - 2037 $ 3

Net Operating Loss Carryover
NOLs reflected above arose in taxable years prior to 2017 and are still subject to prior tax law which allows for carryback and limits the period over which carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income as shown in the above table. Utilization of the Company's loss carryovers is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income. Most of the net operating loss carryover originated from the Company's U.S. and international annuity business, including from the hedging program. The U.S. net operating loss carryover in the table above included $437 of NOL's of the life and annuity run-off business that the Company will retain. Given the expected earnings of the Company going forward, including earnings of its property and casualty, group benefits and mutual fund businesses, the Company expects to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize its net operating loss carryover. Although the Company projects there will be sufficient future taxable income to fully recover the remainder of the loss carryover, the Company's estimate of the likely realization may change over time.
Tax Credit Carryovers
Alternative Minimum Tax Credits- As noted above, because AMT credits are refundable, the Company reflected AMT credits, net of a sequestration fee payable, as a current tax receivable at its undiscounted amount and they are no longer included as deferred tax assets.
Foreign Tax Credits- These credits are available to offset regular federal income taxes from future taxable income. The use of these credits prior to expiration depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income to first utilize all U.S. net operating loss carryovers. However, the Company has purchased certain investments which allow for utilization of the foreign tax credits without first using the net operating loss carryover. Consequently, the Company believes it is more likely than not the foreign tax credit carryover will be fully realized. Accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided.

In addition to the effect of tax-exempt interest, the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects a federal income tax benefit of $15 related to a deduction for stock-based compensation that vested at a fair value per share greater than the fair value on the date of grant.
The Company recognized an $877 increase in income tax expense in 2017 due to the effects of Tax Reform, primarily due to the reduction in net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.
Additionally, reflected above is a benefit of $79 in 2016 due to the investment in solar energy partnerships. The total tax benefit from the transaction was $113 which includes the tax effects of the related financial statement realized loss from writing down the investments in the partnerships.
Also included in 2016 is a tax benefit primarily due to the sale of the Company's U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries.

The tax benefit of $37 relates to the difference between the tax basis and book basis of the Company's investment in the subsidiaries net of additional foreign tax rate differentials. The total estimated tax benefit recognized in 2016 related to the sale of the U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries was $76. For discussion of this transaction, see Note 20 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in the period of the release.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a current income tax receivable of $811, including $790 of AMT credits receivable which consist of $846 of AMT credits offset by a $56 sequestration fee payable. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a current income tax receivable of $141.
The federal audit of the years 2012 and 2013 was completed as of March 31, 2017 with no additional adjustments. The federal audit of The Company's recently acquired subsidiary Maxum for the 2014 tax year was completed as of December 31, 2017 with no adjustments. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for any potential adjustments that may result from tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open tax years.
The Company classifies interest and penalties (if applicable) as income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognized no interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Company had no interest payable as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company does not believe it would be subject to any penalties in any open tax years and, therefore, has not recorded any accrual for penalties.

18. Employee Benefit Plans

Investment and Savings Plan
Substantially all U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in The Hartford Investment and Savings Plan under which designated contributions may be invested in a variety of investments, including up to 10% in a fund consisting largely of common stock of The Hartford. The Company's contributions include a non-elective contribution of 2.0% of eligible compensation and a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution of up to 6.0% of eligible compensation contributed by the employee each pay period. The Company also maintains a non-qualified savings plan, The Hartford Excess Savings Plan, with the dollar-for-dollar matching contributions of employee compensation in excess of the amount that can be contributed under the tax-qualified Investment and Savings Plan. An employee's eligible compensation includes overtime and bonuses but for the Investment and Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan combined, is limited to $1 annually. The total cost to The Hartford for these plans was approximately $113, $115 and $117 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Additionally, The Hartford has established defined contribution pension plans for certain employees of the Company’s international subsidiaries. The cost to The Hartford for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 for these plans was immaterial.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016 , Investment and Savings Plan assets totaling $540 and $438, respectively, were invested in the separate accounts of HLIC.
Post Retirement Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plan- The Company maintains The Hartford Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees, a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”) that covers substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2013. The Company also maintains non-qualified pension plans to provide retirement benefits previously accrued that are in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
The Plan includes two benefit formulas, both of which are frozen: a final average pay formula (for which all accruals ceased as of December 31, 2008) and a cash balance formula for which benefit accruals ceased as of December 31, 2012, although interest will continue to accrue to existing cash balance formula account balances. Employees who were participants as of December 31, 2012 continue to earn vesting credit with respect to their frozen accrued benefits if they continue to work. The Hartford Excess Pension Plan II, the Company's non-qualified excess pension benefit plan for certain highly compensated employees, is also frozen.
Group Retiree Health Plan- The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. The Company’s contribution for health care benefits will depend upon the retiree’s date of retirement and years of service. In addition, the plan has a defined dollar cap for certain retirees which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion of the health care obligations through a trust fund where such prefunding can be accomplished on a tax effective basis. Beginning January 1, 2017, for retirees 65 and older who were participating in the Retiree PPO Medical

Plan, the Company funds the cost of medical and dental health care benefits through contributions to a Health Reimbursement Account and covered individuals can access a variety of insurance plans from a health care exchange. Effective January 1, 2002, Company-subsidized retiree medical, retiree dental and retiree life insurance benefits were eliminated for employees with original hire dates with the Company on or after January 1, 2002. The Company also amended its postretirement medical, dental and life insurance coverage plans to no longer provide subsidized coverage for employees who retired on or after January 1, 2014.
Assumptions
Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other postretirement expense under the defined benefit pension plan and group retiree health plan are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The assumed discount rates and yield curve is based on high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. Based on all available market and industry information, it was determined that 3.73% and 3.55% were the appropriate discount rates as of December 31, 2017 to calculate the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations, respectively.
The expected long-term rate of return is based on actual compound rates of return earned over various historical time periods. The Company also considers the investment volatility, duration and total returns for various time periods related to the characteristics of the pension obligation, which are influenced by the Company's workforce demographics. In addition, the Company considers long-term market return expectations for an investment mix that generally anticipates 60% fixed income securities and 40% non fixed income securities (global equities, hedge funds and private market alternatives) to derive an expected long-term rate of return. Based upon these analyses, management determined the long-term rate of return assumption to be 6.60% and 6.70% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. To determine the Company's 2018 expense, the Company is currently assuming an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.60%.

A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have an insignificant effect on the amounts reported for other postretirement plans.
Obligations and Funded Status
The following tables set forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets, as well as the funded status of the Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans. International plans represent an immaterial percentage of total pension assets, liabilities and expense and, for reporting purposes, are combined with domestic plans.

Changes in assumptions in 2017 primarily included a $350 increase in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of a decline in the discount rate from 4.22% as of the December 31, 2016 valuation to 3.73% as of the December 31, 2017 valuation. Changes in assumptions in 2016 included a decrease of $51 related to the Company's use of updated mortality rates, partially offset by an increase of $21 related to a reduction in the discount rate.
On June 30, 2017, the Company transferred invested assets and cash from plan assets to purchase a group annuity contract that transferred approximately $1.6 billion of the Company's outstanding pension obligations related to certain U.S. retirees, terminated vested participants and beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750. The settlement charge was included in the corporate category for segment reporting.

The fair value of assets for pension benefits, and hence the funded status, presented in the table above excludes assets of $144 and $132 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, held in rabbi trusts and designated for the non-qualified pension plans. The assets do not qualify as plan assets; however, the assets are available to pay benefits for certain retired, terminated and active participants. Such assets are available to the Company’s general creditors in the event of insolvency. The rabbi trust assets consist of equity and fixed income investments. To the extent the fair value of these rabbi trusts were included in the table above, pension plan assets would have been $3,736 and $4,811 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the funded status of pension benefits would have been $(640) and $(840) as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) and Other Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
As a result of the pension settlement, in 2017, the Company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750 ($488 after-tax) and a reduction to shareholders' equity of $144.
In connection with this transaction, the Company made a contribution of $280 in September 2017 to the U.S. qualified pension plan in order to maintain the plan's pre-transaction funded status.
Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted the full yield curve approach in the estimation of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and non-qualified pension plans and the postretirement benefit plan. The full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that are used in its determination of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. The change has been made to provide a better estimate of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by better aligning projected benefit cash flows with corresponding spot rates on the yield curve rather than using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve as had been done historically.
This change does not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations as the change in the interest cost in net income is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported for the period in other comprehensive income. The change reduced the before tax interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by $32 as of December 31, 2017. The discount rate being used to measure interest cost is 3.58% for the period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 and 3.37% for the period from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 for the qualified pension plan, 3.55% for the non-qualified pension plan, and 3.13% for the postretirement benefit plan. Under the Company's historical estimation approach, the weighted average discount rate for the interest cost component would have been 4.22% for the period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 and 3.92% for the period from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 for the qualified pension plan, 4.19% for the non-qualified pension plan and 3.97% for the postretirement benefit plan. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, and accordingly, has recognized the effect prospectively beginning in 2017.

accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost during 2018 is $48. The estimated prior service cost for the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit cost during 2018 is $(7). The estimated net loss for the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost during 2018 is $6.
Plan Assets
Investment Strategy and Target Allocation
The overall investment strategy of the Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. With respect to asset management, the oversight responsibility of the Plan rests with The Hartford’s Pension Fund Trust and Investment Committee composed of individuals whose responsibilities include establishing overall objectives and the setting of investment policy; selecting appropriate investment options and ranges; reviewing the asset allocation mix and asset allocation targets on a regular basis; and monitoring performance to determine whether or not the rate of return objectives are being met and that policy and guidelines are being followed. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Plan.
Target Asset Allocation

 Pension Plans Other Postretirement Plans
 minimum maximum minimum maximum
Equity securities 5 % 35 % 15 % 45 %
Fixed income securities 50 % 70 % 55 % 85 %
Alternative assets — % 45 % — % — %

Divergent market performance among different asset classes may, from time to time, cause the asset allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used, as necessary, to bring the allocation within tactical ranges.
The majority of the Plan assets are invested in Hartford Life Insurance Company separate accounts managed by HIMCO, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On January 2, 2018, the assets of the plan previously invested in the separate accounts of HLIC were transferred to a third party custodian. The Plan invests in commingled funds and partnerships managed by unaffiliated managers to gain exposure to emerging markets, equity, hedge funds and other alternative investments. These portfolios encompass multiple asset classes reflecting the current needs of the Plan, the investment preferences and risk tolerance of the Plan and the desired degree of diversification. These asset classes include publicly traded equities, bonds and alternative investments and are made up of individual investments in cash

and cash equivalents, equity securities, debt securities, asset-backed securities and hedge funds. Hedge fund investments represent a diversified portfolio of partnership investments in a variety of strategies.
In addition, the Company uses U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts and U.S. Treasury STRIPS in a duration overlay program to adjust the duration of Plan assets to better match the duration of the benefit obligation.

The tables below provide fair value level 3 roll-forwards for the Pension Plan Assets for which significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are used in the fair value measurement on a recurring basis. The Plan classifies the fair value of financial instruments within Level 3 if there are no observable markets for the instruments or, in the absence of active markets, if one or more of the significant inputs used to determine fair value are based on the Plan’s own assumptions. Therefore, the gains and losses in the tables below include changes in fair value due to both observable and unobservable factors.

Concentration of Risk
In order to minimize risk, the Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments. In addition, the Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed on permissible investment options. Permissible investments include U.S. equity, international equity, alternative asset and fixed income investments including derivative instruments. Derivative instruments include future contracts, options, swaps, currency forwards, caps or floors and will be used to control risk or enhance return but will not be used for leverage purposes.
Securities specifically prohibited from purchase include, but are not limited to: shares or fixed income instruments issued by The Hartford, short sales of any type within long-only portfolios, non-derivative securities involving the use of margin, leveraged floaters and inverse floaters, including money market obligations, natural resource real properties such as oil, gas or timber and precious metals.
Other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the Plan does not have any material exposure to any concentration risk of a single issuer.

19. Stock Compensation Plans

The Company's stock-based compensation plans are described below. Shares issued in satisfaction of stock-based compensation may be made available from authorized but unissued shares, shares held by the Company in treasury or from shares purchased in the open market. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued shares from treasury in satisfaction of stock-based compensation.
Stock-based compensation expense, included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, was as follows:
Stock-Based Compensation Expense

---------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ---- ---- - --- - - --

 For the years ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Stock-based compensation plans expense [1] $ 116 $ 81 $ 78
Income tax benefit (41 ) (29 ) (27 )
Excess tax benefit on awards vested, exercised and expired (15 ) — —
Total stock-based compensation plans expense, after-tax $ 60 $ 52 $ 51

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] The increase in stock-based compensation plans expense in 2017 was largely due to a change made in 2017 to provide accelerated vesting of newly issued restricted stock unit and performance share awards to retirement eligible employees.

The Company did not capitalize any cost of stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2017, the total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $68, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.
Stock Plan
Future stock-based awards may be granted under The Hartford's 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the "Incentive Stock Plan") other than the Subsidiary Stock Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan described below. The Incentive Stock Plan provides for awards to be granted in the form of non-qualified or incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock or restricted stock units, or any other form of stock-based award. The maximum number of shares, subject to adjustments set forth in the Incentive Stock Plan, that may be issued to Company employees and third party service providers during the 10-year duration of the Incentive Stock Plan is 12,000,000 shares. If any award under an earlier incentive stock plan is forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expires unexercised, or is settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the net issuance of a lesser number of shares than the

number subject to the award, the shares of stock subject to such award (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for awards under the Incentive Stock Plan and such shares shall be added to the maximum limit. As of December 31, 2017, there were 8,397,784 shares available for future issuance.
The fair values of awards granted under the Incentive Stock Plan are measured as of the grant date and expensed ratably over the awards’ vesting periods, generally 3 years. For stock option awards to retirement-eligible employees the Company recognizes the expense over a period shorter than the stated vesting period because the employees receive accelerated vesting upon retirement and therefore the vesting period is considered non-substantive. Beginning with awards granted in 2017, employees with restricted stock units and performance shares receive accelerated vesting upon meeting certain retirement eligibility criteria.
Stock Option Awards
Under the Incentive Stock Plan, options granted have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and an option’s maximum term is not to exceed 10 years. Options generally become exercisable over a three year period commencing one year from the date of grant. Certain other options become exercisable at the later of three years from the date of grant or upon specified market appreciation of the Company's common shares.
The Company uses a hybrid lattice/Monte-Carlo based option valuation model (the “valuation model”) that incorporates the possibility of early exercise of options into the valuation. The valuation model also incorporates the Company’s historical termination and exercise experience to determine the option value.
The valuation model incorporates ranges of assumptions for inputs, and those ranges are disclosed below. The term structure of volatility is generally constructed utilizing implied volatilities from exchange-traded options, CPP warrants related to the Company’s stock, historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model, and accommodates variations in employee preference and risk-tolerance by segregating the grantee pool into a series of behavioral cohorts and conducting a fair valuation for each cohort individually. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents, in a mathematical sense, the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the value of the Company's closing stock price on the last trading day of the period in excess of the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative intrinsic value. The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $12.38, $12.14 and $10.60, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $8, $1, and $16, respectively.
Share Awards
Share awards granted under the Incentive Stock Plan and outstanding include restricted stock units and performance shares.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units are share equivalents that are credited with dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid in incremental shares when the underlying units vest. Restricted stock are shares of The Hartford's common stock with restrictions as to transferability until vested. Restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are valued equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Generally, restricted stock units vest at the end of or over three years; certain restricted stock units vest at the end of 5 years. Beginning in 2017, restricted stock units vest at the earlier of

employees retirement eligibility date or three years. Equity awards granted to non-employee directors generally vest in one year and were made in the form of restricted stock units in 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Performance Shares
Performance shares become payable within a range of 0% to 200% of the number of shares initially granted based upon the attainment of specific performance goals achieved at the end of or over three years. While most performance shares vest at the end of or over three years, certain performance shares vest at the end of five years. Beginning in 2017, performance shares vest at the earlier of employees retirement eligibility date or three years.
Performance share awards that are not dependent on market conditions are valued equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant less a discount for the absence of dividends. Stock-compensation expense for these performance share awards without market conditions is based on a current estimate of the number of awards expected to vest and, therefore, may change during the performance period as new estimates of performance are available.
Other performance share awards or portions thereof have a market condition based upon the Company's total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies within a three year period. Stock compensation expense for these performance share awards is based on the number of awards expected to vest as estimated at the grant date and therefore does not change for changes in estimated performance. The Company uses a risk neutral Monte-Carlo valuation model that incorporates time to

The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of restricted stock units and restricted stock granted during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $48.90, $42.87 and $42.25, respectively. The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of performance shares granted during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $48.89, $41.50 and $42.40, respectively.
The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $94, $128 and $144, respectively, based on actual or estimated performance factors. The Company did not make cash payments in settlement of stock compensation during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Subsidiary Stock Plan
In 2013 the Company established a subsidiary stock-based compensation plan similar to The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan except that it awards non-public subsidiary stock as compensation. The Company recognized stock-based compensation plan expense of $9, $7 and $7 in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for the subsidiary stock plan. Upon employee vesting of subsidiary stock, the Company recognizes a noncontrolling equity interest. Employees are restricted from selling vested subsidiary stock to anyone other than the Company and the Company has discretion on the amount of stock to repurchase. Therefore the subsidiary

stock is classified as equity because it is not mandatorily redeemable. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased $2 in subsidiary stock.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company sponsors The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under this plan, eligible employees of The Hartford purchase common stock of the Company at a discount rate of 5% of the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period. Accordingly, the plan is a noncompensatory plan. Employees purchase a variable number of shares of stock through payroll deductions elected as of the beginning of the offering period. The Company may sell up to 15,400,000 shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2017, there were 4,517,633 shares available for future issuance. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 204,533 shares, 222,113 shares, and 249,344 shares were sold, respectively. The weighted average per share fair value of the discount under the ESPP was $2.63, $2.26 and $2.15 during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value is estimated based on the 5% discount off the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period.

Discontinued Operations
Sale of life and annuity run-off business
On December 3, 2017, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hartford Holdings, Inc. (HHI) entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Company's life and annuity run-off business, to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safra Group. Under the terms of the sale agreement, the investor group will form a limited partnership that will acquire Hartford Life, Inc. (HLI), a holding company, and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries, for cash of approximately $1.4 billion after a pre-closing dividend to The Hartford of $300 and The Hartford will receive a 9.7% ownership interest in the limited partnership valued at a cost of $164. All equity investors of the

limited partnership are restricted from selling their interest for five years. In addition, as part of the terms of the sale agreement, The Hartford will reduce its long-term debt by $142 because the debt, which was issued by HLI, will be included as part of the sale. Including cash proceeds and the retained equity interest and net of transaction costs, net proceeds for the sale are approximately $1.5 billion.
In addition, The Hartford will retain estimated tax benefits of the life and annuity run-off business totaling approximately $700 based on the newly enacted tax rate of 21%. The estimated retained tax benefits, which will be available for realization subject to the level and timing of The Hartford’s taxable income, include principally $437 of net operating loss carryovers and $235 of alternative minimum tax credits. The amount of net operating loss carryovers ultimately retained will be based on the tax basis of the operations sold. As a result of The Hartford's election to retain a portion of the net operating loss carryovers of the life and annuity run-off business, the Company did not recognize a tax benefit for the loss on sale.
Prior to the closing of the sale, the Company’s group benefits and mutual funds subsidiaries, which are currently subsidiaries of HLI, will be transferred from HLI to HHI and will not be part of the sale.
The transaction completes The Hartford’s exit from the life and annuity run-off businesses and is anticipated to close by June 30, 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. The life and annuity run-off operations meet the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations and are reported in the Corporate category.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company has recognized an estimated loss on sale within discontinued operations of approximately $3.3 billion. Under the agreement, results from the discontinued operations inure to the buyer; therefore, the loss from discontinued operations during the period between signing and closing will remain largely unchanged as any income earned by the life and annuity run-off business will be offset by a higher loss on sale. At closing, shareholders’ equity will be further reduced for the amount of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) of the life and annuity run-off business, which was approximately $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2017, largely consisting of net unrealized gains on investments, net of shadow DAC.
Following the sale, the Company will manage invested assets of the life and annuity run-off business for an initial term of five years and provide transition services for an estimated period of 12 to 24 months.
The following table summarizes the major classes of assets and liabilities of discontinued operations.

[1] Represents the estimated accrued loss on sale of the Company's life and annuity run-off business.

To settle outstanding claims, the Company’s property and casualty operations previously bought structured settlements from the life and annuity run-off business held for sale. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $688 and $712, respectively, of liabilities for structured settlements in cases where the Company did not obtain a release of liability from the claimant which are included in liabilities held for sale. As the life and annuity run-off business will become a third party to the Company upon closing of the sale, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets include a reinsurance recoverable from the life and annuity run-off business of $688 and $712, respectively, with corresponding unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of $688 and $712, respectively, representing the Company’s direct obligation to claimants.
The Hartford has guaranteed the obligations of certain life, accident and health and annuity contracts of the life and annuity run-off business written by Hartford Life Insurance Company ("HLIC") between 1990 and 1997and written by Hartford Life

and Annuity Insurance Company ("HLAIC") between 1993 and 2009. After the sale closes, HLIC, HLAIC and the purchaser will indemnify the Company for any liability arising under the guarantees. The  guarantees have no limitation as to maximum potential future payments. The Hartford has not recorded a liability and the likelihood for any payments under these guarantees is remote.

[1] As a result of the net loss from continuing operations for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, the Company was required to use basic weighted average common shares outstanding in the calculation of diluted loss per share, since the inclusion of shares for stock compensation plans and warrants would have been antidilutive to the earnings (loss) per share calculation.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. 90  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 1, 2017 (in thousands): ----------- ------- -------------------- -------------------------- - --------------------------- ----- - ------ Operating Leases Fiscal Year Purchase O...

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS TubeMogul On December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill.

In connection with our entry into the agreement to acquire RB Foods, we entered into a commitment letter, dated July 18, 2017 (the "Commitment Letter"), under which certain banks agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") of up to $4.2 billion in the aggregate. On August 7, 2017, we entered into a Senior Unsecured Bridge Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions under which those financial institutions agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") for the purpose of providing the financing necessary to fund all or a portion of the consideration to be paid pursuant to the terms of the agreement related to the acquisition of RB Foods and related fees and expenses (the "Bridge Loan Commitment"). The Bridge Facility provided that the Bridge Loan Commitment would be reduced in equivalent amounts upon any incurrence by McCormick of, among other things, term loans and/or the issuance of equity or notes in a public offering or private placement prior to the consummation of the transaction, subject to certain exce...

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.

Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at the acquired business.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS TubeMogul On December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards.

As of January 1, 2018, the Company will reclassify from AOCI to retained earnings net unrealized gains of $83, after tax, related to equity securities, AFS having a fair value of $1.0 billion. Had the new accounting guidance been in place since the beginning of 2017, the Company would have recognized mark-to-market gains of $25 after-tax in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Revenue Recognition
The FASB issued updated guidance for recognizing revenue. The guidance excludes insurance contracts and financial instruments. Revenue is to be recognized when, or as, goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity is expected to receive in exchange for those goods or services, and this accounting guidance is similar to current accounting for many transactions. This guidance is effective retrospectively on January 1, 2018, with a choice of restating prior periods or recognizing a cumulative effect for contracts in place as of the adoption date. Upon adoption on January 1, 2018, the Company will present fee income within the Mutual Funds segment gross of related distribution costs that are currently netted against revenues.  Distribution costs of $188, $184, and $190 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, will be reclassified from fee income to insurance operating costs and other expenses. The adoption will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or net income.

Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
Property and casualty insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period and include accruals for ultimate premium revenue anticipated under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. Unearned premiums represent the premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds, management’s experience and current economic conditions. The Company charges off any balances that are determined to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $132 and $137 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Group life, disability and accident premiums are generally both due from policyholders and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the period of the contracts.
The Company provides investment management, administrative and distribution services to mutual funds and exchange-traded products. The Company earns fees, primarily based on the average daily net asset values of the mutual funds and exchange-traded products, which are recorded as fee income in the period in which the services are provided. Commission fees are based on the sale proceeds and recognized at the time of the transaction. Transfer agent fees are assessed as a charge per account and recognized as fee income in the period in which the services are provided.
Other revenues primarily consists of servicing revenues which are recognized as services are performed.
Dividends to Policyholders
Policyholder dividends are paid to certain property and casualty policyholders. Policies that receive dividends are referred to as participating policies. Participating dividends to policyholders are accrued and reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses and other liabilities using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.
Net written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance policies represented 10%, 9% and 10% of total net written premiums for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Participating dividends to property and casualty policyholders were $35, $15 and $17 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
There were no additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders.
Investments

[") and are carried at fair value. The after-tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Effective January 1, 2018, equity securities will be measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement discussion above. Fixed maturities for which the Company elected the fair value option are classified as FVO, generally certain securities that contain embedded credit derivatives, are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in realized capital gains and losses. Mortgage loans are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of valuation allowances. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value and are primarily accounted for under the equity method with the Company’s share of earnings included in net investment income. Recognition of income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial information, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month delay and hedge funds on a one-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships and other alternative investments’ general partners. Other investments primarily consist of derivative instruments which are carried at fair value.
Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses
Net realized capital gains and losses from investment sales are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized capital gains and losses also result from fair value changes in fixed maturities and equity securities FVO, and derivatives contracts (both free-standing and embedded) that do not qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes as well as ineffectiveness on derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Impairments and mortgage loan valuation allowances are recognized as net realized capital losses in accordance with the Company’s impairment and mortgage loan valuation allowance policies as discussed in Note 6 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency transaction remeasurements are also included in net realized capital gains and losses.
Net Investment Income
Interest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized when earned on the constant effective yield method based on estimated timing of cash flows. The amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturities also takes into consideration call and maturity dates that produce the lowest yield. For securitized financial assets subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or estimated future prepayments using the retrospective method; however, if these investments are impaired and for certain other asset-backed securities, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees and make-whole payments on fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For

equity securities, dividends are recognized as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily use the equity method of accounting to recognize the Company’s share of earnings; however, for a portion of those investments, the Company used investment fund accounting applied to a wholly-owned fund of funds which was liquidated during 2016. For impaired debt securities, the Company accretes the new cost basis to the estimated future cash flows over the expected remaining life of the security by prospectively adjusting the security’s yield, if necessary.

[") and exchange traded derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions. The types of instruments may include swaps, caps, floors, forwards, futures and options to achieve one of four Company-approved objectives:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility;

- --------------------
• to manage liquidity;

- -----------------------------
• to control transaction costs;

- -------------------------------------------------
• to enter into synthetic replication transactions.

Interest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, little to no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.
Interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified dates, the amount, if any, by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike interest rate or falls below the floor strike interest rate, applied to a notional principal amount. A premium payment determined at inception is made by the purchaser of the contract and no principal payments are exchanged.
Forward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.
Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled daily in cash.

Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The contracts may reference commodities, which grant the purchaser the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer commodities at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.
Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.
The Company’s derivative transactions conducted in insurance company subsidiaries are used in strategies permitted under the derivative use plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York insurance departments.
Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty or under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.
The Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based on daily market value movements. For information on collateral, see the derivative collateral arrangements section in Note 7 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, OTC-cleared transactions include price alignment amounts either received or paid on the variation margin, which are reflected in realized capital gains and losses or, if characterized as interest, in net investment income.
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges - Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are

reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded immediately in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities - The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses.
Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing
To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness and ineffectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values, cash flows or net investment in foreign operations of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed primarily using quantitative methods as well as using qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Hedge ineffectiveness of the hedge relationships are measured each reporting period using the “Change in Variable Cash Flows Method”, the “Change in Fair Value Method”, the “Hypothetical Derivative Method”, or the “Dollar Offset Method”.
Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value

hedge, the derivative continues to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is no longer adjusted through current period earnings and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item through the applicable earnings component associated with the hedged item.
When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.
In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.
Embedded Derivatives
The Company purchases investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and losses.
Credit Risk
Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("]:
NOTE 7. Commitments and Contingencies Lease Commitments The Company has various lease agreements with other parties with terms up to 30 years. Non-cancelable, long-term leases may include provisions for maintenance, options to purchase and options to extend the terms.

[") agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives exceed the contractual thresholds. For the Company’s domestic derivative programs, the maximum uncollateralized threshold for a derivative counterparty for a single legal entity is $10. The Company also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk

due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.
Cash
Cash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions.
Reinsurance
The Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to diversify its exposures and provide statutory surplus relief. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers and is a member of and participates in reinsurance pools and associations. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies or pools have underwritten.
Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e. risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting, and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer. If the ceded and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as financing transactions.
Premiums, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded and assumed reinsurance transactions. Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums, which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables are balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Changes in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reported in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Company']:
Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,397 million shares and 509 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification). As a result, we will not proceed with the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. 77 Share Repurchase Program In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 b...

For deferred tax assets, the Company records a valuation allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost to acquire a business over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. The goodwill impairment test follows a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
Management’s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations, including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital required to support the business, future business growth, earnings projections and assets under management for certain reporting units and the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairments.
Intangible Assets
Acquired intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include purchased customer and agency or other distribution relationships and licenses measured at fair value at acquisition. The Company amortizes finite-lived other intangible assets over their useful lives generally on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, ranging from 1 to 15 years. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment

generally when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangibles. If the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows, the impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment which includes capitalized software is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is determined principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation was $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Depreciation expense was $197, $186, and $164 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
For property and casualty and group life and disability insurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported ("]:

The Company also previously elected the fair value option for certain equity securities in order to align the accounting with total return swap contracts that hedged the risk associated with the investments. The swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting and the change in value of both the equity securities and the total return swaps were recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. These equity securities were classified within equity securities, AFS on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The previous cost basis less the impairment becomes the new cost basis. The Company’s evaluation and assumptions used to determine an equity OTTI include, but is not limited to, (a) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost of the security, (b) changes in the financial condition, credit rating and near-term prospects of the issuer, (c) whether the issuer is current on preferred stock dividends and (d) the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery. For the remaining equity securities which are determined to be temporarily impaired, the Company asserts its intent and ability to retain those equity securities until the price recovers.

As of December 31, 2017, AFS securities in an unrealized loss position consisted of 2,526 securities, primarily in the corporate sector, which were depressed primarily due to an increase in interest rates and/or widening of credit spreads since the securities were purchased. As of December 31, 2017, 96% of these securities were depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The improvement in unrealized losses during 2017 was primarily attributable to tighter credit spreads.
Most of the securities depressed for twelve months or more relate to corporate securities and structured securities with exposure to commercial real estate. Corporate securities and commercial real estate securities were primarily depressed because current market spreads are wider than spreads at the securities']:

[2] No allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was required as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The Company analyzes recent developments in

commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. Based on this analysis, the Company may

adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets.
Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance

recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.

Yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements result in passing all or a portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer receives a proportionate amount of the premiums less an allowance for commissions and expenses and is liable for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments.

Shelf Registrations
On July 29, 2016, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-212778) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. In that The Hartford is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the registration statement went

effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the three-year life of the registration statement.

['s consolidated operating results and liquidity.
Effective December 31, 2016, the Company entered into an ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to reduce uncertainty about potential adverse development of asbestos and environmental reserves. Under the ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net asbestos and environmental reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse asbestos and environmental reserve development after December 31, 2016 will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit. Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium paid are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred. Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. Furthermore, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims could ultimately exceed the $1.5 billion treaty limit in which case any adverse development in excess of the treaty limit would be absorbed as a charge to earnings by the Company. In these scenarios, the effect of these changes could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results and liquidity. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has incurred $285 in adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the ADC treaty with NICO.

Lease Commitments
The total rental expense on operating leases was $57, $53, and $60 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, which excludes sublease rental income of $3, $2, and $3 in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions, as applicable. Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $704, $521 and $1,517 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and income (losses) from foreign operations of $19, $(74) and $(39) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”). Tax Reform establishes new tax laws that will affect 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, (3) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, (4) changes to the discounting of statutory reserves for tax purposes, and (5) limitations on net operating losses (NOLs) generated after December 31, 2017 though there is no impact to the Company’s current NOL carryforwards.
In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of Tax Reform, the Company recorded a provisional net income tax expense of $877 in the period ending December 31, 2017. This net expense consists of a $821 reduction of The Company’s deferred tax assets primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and a $56 sequestration fee payable associated with refundable AMT credits.

Plan Assets
Investment Strategy and Target Allocation
The overall investment strategy of the Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. With respect to asset management, the oversight responsibility of the Plan rests with The Hartford’s Pension Fund Trust and Investment Committee composed of individuals whose responsibilities include establishing overall objectives and the setting of investment policy; selecting appropriate investment options and ranges; reviewing the asset allocation mix and asset allocation targets on a regular basis; and monitoring performance to determine whether or not the rate of return objectives are being met and that policy and guidelines are being followed. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Plan.
Target Asset Allocation

----------------------- ------------- -------------------------- ------- ------- -- - -- -

 Pension Plans Other Postretirement Plans
 minimum maximum minimum maximum
Equity securities 5 % 35 % 15 % 45 %
Fixed income securities 50 % 70 % 55 % 85 %
Alternative assets — % 45 % — % — %

Divergent market performance among different asset classes may, from time to time, cause the asset allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used, as necessary, to bring the allocation within tactical ranges.
The majority of the Plan assets are invested in Hartford Life Insurance Company separate accounts managed by HIMCO, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On January 2, 2018, the assets of the plan previously invested in the separate accounts of HLIC were transferred to a third party custodian. The Plan invests in commingled funds and partnerships managed by unaffiliated managers to gain exposure to emerging markets, equity, hedge funds and other alternative investments. These portfolios encompass multiple asset classes reflecting the current needs of the Plan, the investment preferences and risk tolerance of the Plan and the desired degree of diversification. These asset classes include publicly traded equities, bonds and alternative investments and are made up of individual investments in cash

and cash equivalents, equity securities, debt securities, asset-backed securities and hedge funds. Hedge fund investments represent a diversified portfolio of partnership investments in a variety of strategies.
In addition, the Company uses U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts and U.S. Treasury STRIPS in a duration overlay program to adjust the duration of Plan assets to better match the duration of the benefit obligation.

The tables below provide fair value level 3 roll-forwards for the Pension Plan Assets for which significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are used in the fair value measurement on a recurring basis. The Plan classifies the fair value of financial instruments within Level 3 if there are no observable markets for the instruments or, in the absence of active markets, if one or more of the significant inputs used to determine fair value are based on the Plan’s own assumptions. Therefore, the gains and losses in the tables below include changes in fair value due to both observable and unobservable factors.

Concentration of Risk
In order to minimize risk, the Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments. In addition, the Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed on permissible investment options. Permissible investments include U.S. equity, international equity, alternative asset and fixed income investments including derivative instruments. Derivative instruments include future contracts, options, swaps, currency forwards, caps or floors and will be used to control risk or enhance return but will not be used for leverage purposes.
Securities specifically prohibited from purchase include, but are not limited to: shares or fixed income instruments issued by The Hartford, short sales of any type within long-only portfolios, non-derivative securities involving the use of margin, leveraged floaters and inverse floaters, including money market obligations, natural resource real properties such as oil, gas or timber and precious metals.
Other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the Plan does not have any material exposure to any concentration risk of a single issuer.

comprised of the following pricing sources and techniques, which are listed in priority order:

• Quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, which are classified as Level 1.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Prices from third-party pricing services, which primarily utilize a combination of techniques. These services utilize recently reported trades of identical, similar, or benchmark securities making adjustments for market observable inputs available through the reporting date. If there are no recently reported trades, they may use a discounted cash flow technique to develop a price using expected cash flows based upon the anticipated future performance of the underlying collateral discounted at an estimated market rate. Both techniques develop prices that consider the time value of future cash flows and provide a margin for risk, including liquidity and credit risk. Most prices provided by third-party

pricing services are classified as Level 2 because the inputs used in pricing the securities are observable. However, some securities that are less liquid or trade less actively are classified as Level 3. Additionally, certain long-dated securities, including certain municipal securities, foreign government/government agency securities, and bank loans, include benchmark interest rate or credit spread assumptions that are not observable in the marketplace and are thus classified as Level 3.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Internal matrix pricing, which is a valuation process internally developed for private placement securities for which the Company is unable to obtain a price from a third-party pricing service. Internal pricing matrices determine credit spreads that, when combined with risk-free rates, are applied to contractual cash flows to develop a price. The Company develops credit spreads using market based data for public securities adjusted for credit spread differentials between public and private securities, which are obtained from a survey of multiple private placement brokers. The market-based reference credit spread considers the issuer’s financial strength and term to maturity, using an independent public security index and trade information, while the credit spread differential considers the non-public nature of the security. Securities priced using internal matrix pricing are classified as Level 2 because the inputs are observable or can be corroborated with observable data.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Independent broker quotes, which are typically non-binding, use inputs that can be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data. Brokers may use present value techniques using assumptions specific to the security types, or they may use recent transactions of similar securities. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3.

The fair value of free-standing derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporate counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. The pricing valuation models primarily use inputs that are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data. The valuation of certain derivatives may include significant inputs that are unobservable, such as volatility levels, and reflect the Company’s view of what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments.
Valuation Controls
The fair value process for investments is monitored by the Valuation Committee, which is a cross-functional group of senior management within the Company that meets at least quarterly. The purpose of the committee is to oversee the pricing policy and procedures, as well as to approve changes to valuation methodologies and pricing sources. Controls and procedures used to assess third-party pricing services are reviewed by the Valuation Committee, including the results of annual due-diligence reviews.
There are also two working groups under the Valuation Committee: a Securities Fair Value Working Group (“Securities

Working Group”) and a Derivatives Fair Value Working Group ("]:

["). The working groups, which include various investment, operations, accounting and risk management professionals, meet monthly to review market data trends, pricing and trading statistics and results, and any proposed pricing methodology changes.
The Securities Working Group reviews prices received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. The group considers trading volume, new issuance activity, market trends, new regulatory rulings and other factors to determine whether the market activity is significantly different than normal activity in an active market. A dedicated pricing unit follows up with trading and investment sector professionals and challenges prices of third-party pricing services when the estimated assumptions used differ from what the unit believes a market participant would use. If the available evidence indicates that pricing from third-party pricing services or broker quotes is based upon transactions that are stale or not from trades made in an orderly market, the Company places little, if any, weight on the third party service’s transaction price and will estimate fair value using an internal process, such as a pricing matrix.
The Derivatives Working Group reviews the inputs, assumptions and methodologies used to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value. A dedicated pricing team works directly with investment sector professionals to investigate the impacts of changes in the market environment on prices or valuations of derivatives. New models and any changes to current models are required to have detailed documentation and are validated to a second source. The model validation documentation and results of validation are presented to the Valuation Committee for approval.
The Company conducts other monitoring controls around securities and derivatives pricing including, but not limited to, the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Review of daily price changes over specific thresholds and new trade comparison to third-party pricing services.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Daily comparison of OTC derivative market valuations to counterparty valuations.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Review of weekly price changes compared to published bond prices of a corporate bond index.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Monthly reviews of price changes over thresholds, stale prices, missing prices, and zero prices.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Monthly validation of prices to a second source for securities in most sectors and for certain derivatives.

In addition, the Company’s enterprise-wide Operational Risk Management function, led by the Chief Risk Officer, is responsible for model risk management and provides an independent review of the suitability and reliability of model inputs, as well as an analysis of significant changes to current models.

[2] The swaptions presented are purchased options that have the right to enter into a pay-fixed swap.

The tables above exclude the portion of ABS, CRE CDOs and certain corporate securities for which fair values are predominately based on independent broker quotes. While the Company does not have access to the significant unobservable inputs that independent brokers may use in their pricing process, the Company believes brokers likely use inputs similar to those used by the Company and third-party pricing services to price similar instruments. As such, in their pricing models, brokers likely use estimated loss severity rates, prepayment rates, constant default rates and credit spreads. Therefore, similar to non-broker priced securities, increases in these inputs would generally cause fair values to decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no significant adjustments were made by the Company to broker prices received.
Transfers between Levels
Transfers of securities among the levels occur at the beginning of the reporting period. The amount of transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 was $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which represented previously on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities that are now off-the-run. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no transfers from Level 2 to Level 1. See the fair value roll-forward tables for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, for the transfers into and out of Level 3.

The contingent consideration is measured at fair value on a quarterly basis by projecting future eligible ETP AUM over the contingency period to estimate the amount of expected payout. The future expected payout is discounted back to the valuation date using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 18.8%. The risk-adjusted discount rate is an internally generated and significant unobservable input to fair value.
Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable Inputs
The Company uses derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and liabilities. However, the derivative instrument may not be classified with the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated asset or liability. Therefore, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives reported in the Level 3 roll-forward may be offset by realized and unrealized gains and losses of the associated assets and liabilities in other line items of the financial statements.

Fair Value Option
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain securities that contain embedded credit derivatives with underlying credit risk primarily related to residential real estate, and these securities are included within Fixed Maturities, FVO on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For certain previously consolidated investment funds, the Company classified the underlying fixed maturities within Fixed Maturities, FVO as a result of the Company']:
Note 18. Income Taxes 76

['s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $787 and $701, respectively, whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management.
In addition, the Company also makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in ABS, CDOs, CMBS and RMBS in the Available-for-Sale Securities table and fixed maturities, FVO, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company’s investment in comparison to the principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits and the Company’s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company’s investment.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company held a significant variable interest in a VIE for which it was not the primary beneficiary. This VIE represented a contingent capital facility that had been held by the Company since February 2007. Assets and liabilities recorded were $1 and $3, respectively, as of December 31, 2016, as well as a maximum exposure to loss of $3. The Company did not have a controlling financial interest and as such, did not consolidate its variable interest in the facility. As of December 31, 2017, the Company no longer held an interest in the facility. For further information on the facility, see Note 13 of these financial statements.
Securities Lending, Repurchase Agreements and Other Collateral Transactions
The Company enters into securities financing transactions as a way to earn additional income or manage liquidity, primarily through securities lending and repurchase agreements.
Securities Lending
Under a securities lending program, the Company lends certain fixed maturities within the corporate, foreign government/government agencies, and municipal sectors as well as equity securities to qualifying third-party borrowers in return for collateral in the form of cash or securities. For domestic and non-domestic loaned securities, respectively, borrowers provide

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
6. Investments (continued)

collateral of 102% and 105% of the fair value of the securities lent at the time of the loan. Borrowers will return the securities to the Company for cash or securities collateral at maturity dates generally of 90 days or less. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, except in the event of default by the counterparty, and is not reflected on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additional collateral is obtained if the fair value of the collateral falls below 100% of the fair value of the loaned securities. The agreements provide the counterparty the right to sell or re-pledge the securities loaned. If cash, rather than securities, is received as collateral, the cash is typically invested in short-term investments or fixed maturities and is reported as an asset on the Company']:

Cash Flow Hedges
For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of OCI and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in current period earnings. All components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Total $ 42 $ 47 $ 36

During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the Company had no ineffectiveness recognized in income within net realized capital gains (losses).
As of December 31, 2017, the before-tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments recorded in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are $86. This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities that will occur over the next twelve months, at which time the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an adjustment to net investment income over the term of the investment cash flows. The maximum term over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability of future cash flows for forecasted transactions, excluding interest payments on existing variable-rate financial instruments, is less than one year.
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company had no net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.
Non-qualifying Strategies
For non-qualifying strategies, including embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from their host contracts and accounted for as derivatives, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings within net realized capital gains (losses).

Property and Casualty Insurance Products Reserves, Net of Reinsurance, that are Discounted

 For the years ended December 31,

Less: amount of discount 410 483 523

Range of discount rates 1.77 % - 14.15 % 1.77 % - 14.15 % 1.77 % - 14.15 %

The current accident year benefit from discounting property and casualty insurance product reserves was $15 in 2017, $27 in 2016 and $35 in 2015. The reduction in the discount benefit in 2017 as compared to 2016 and in 2016 as compared to 2015 reflects lower claim volume and a shorter than expected payment pattern. Reserves are discounted at rates in effect at the time claims were incurred, ranging from 1.77% for accident year 2012 to 14.15% for accident year 1981.
The reserves recorded for the Company’s property and casualty insurance products at December 31, 2017 represent the Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant

uncertainties surrounding reserves it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company’s results of operations or cash flows.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses are also impacted by trends including frequency and severity as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment. In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in the ultimate settlement of the liabilities gross of reinsurance include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks

inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in gross reserves include expanding theories of liabilities and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following tables summarize the balance sheet impact, including the benefit obligations, assets and funded status associated with our significant pension and other postretirement benefit plans. ---------------------------------------------- ---------- ---------------- -------------- ------ ------ ---- ------ ------ ------ - ----- - ---- ----- --- ----- ----- - ---- ----- ---- - Pension Benefits U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2017 2016 2017 2016 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of yea...
