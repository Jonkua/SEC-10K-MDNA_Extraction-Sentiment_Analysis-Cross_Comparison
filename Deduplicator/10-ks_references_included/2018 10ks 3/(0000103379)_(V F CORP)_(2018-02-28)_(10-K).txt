ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

--------

OVERVIEW

VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF” or the "Company”) is a global leader in the design, production, procurement, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and related products. VF’s diverse portfolio of more than 30 brands meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on four drivers — reshape our portfolio, transform our model, elevate direct-to-consumer and distort Asia.
VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a

broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, denim, backpack, luggage, accessory and apparel categories. Our products are marketed to consumers shopping in specialty stores, department stores, national chains, mass merchants and our own direct-to-consumer operations, which includes VF-operated stores, concession retail stores and e-commerce sites.
VF is organized by groupings of businesses called “coalitions”. The three coalitions are Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear and Imagewear. These coalitions are our reportable segments for financial reporting purposes.

HIGHLIGHTS OF 2017

2017 marked the beginning of VF's renewed strategic journey, as we focused our efforts and investments on the evolution of VF and our brands to become more consumer and retail centric. Our focus and investment in support of our strategies drove accelerated growth and value creation across key pillars of our portfolio in 2017. The choices and capabilities embedded in our strategic growth plan have enabled our strong portfolio of diverse global brands to connect more deeply with consumers, and the results in 2017 reflect initial success in the execution of our plan as VF's core growth engines - international, direct-to-consumer, Outdoor & Action Sports and our workwear platform - continued to show strength.
We are still in the early phases of this strategic journey, and while the consumer landscape is rapidly changing and the global retail environment around the world is dynamic, we believe the choices and capabilities embedded in our strategic growth plan will enable our strong portfolio of diverse global brands to connect more deeply with consumers and fuel growth into the future.

We continued reshaping our portfolio in 2017 to align with our financial aspirations, as we closed on the acquisition of Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co. ("Williamson-Dickie") in the fourth quarter of 2017, and announced the acquisition of Icebreaker Holdings, Ltd., which we expect to close in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019. Further, we completed the sale of the Licensing Business in 2017 and have announced the planned sale of the Nautica® brand business.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”). The Tax Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% starting in 2018 and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As part of the legislation, U.S. companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the U.S. and revalue deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base tax rate of 21%. The transitional impact of the Tax Act resulted in a provisional net

VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K 21

charge of approximately of $465.5 million, or $1.15 cents per share, during the fourth quarter of 2017.
The execution of our 2021 strategic choices, including the re-shaping of our portfolio, and significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax laws, delivered the following results in 2017:

- -----------------------------------------------------------
• 2017 revenues were up 7% to $11.8 billion compared to 2016.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Outdoor & Action Sports coalition revenues increased 8% over 2016 to $8.2 billion, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Direct-to-consumer revenues increased 17% over 2016, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency, and accounted for 32% of VF’s total revenues in 2017. VF opened 111 retail stores in 2017. E-commerce revenues increased 34% in 2017.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• International revenues increased 12%, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency, and represented 41% of VF’s total revenues in 2017.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 50.5% in 2017, reflecting benefits from pricing and a mix-shift toward higher margin businesses, partially offset by impacts from foreign currency.

- ---------------------------------------------------
• Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion in 2017.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Earnings per share decreased 30% to $1.79 in 2017 from $2.56 in 2016, driven by the negative impact from the recent U.S. tax legislation, incremental transaction and deal-related costs and unfavorable impacts from foreign currency that were partially offset by contributions related to the Williamson-Dickie acquisition.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• VF increased the quarterly dividend rate by 10% in the fourth quarter, marking the 45th consecutive year of increase in the rate of dividends paid per share.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• VF repurchased $1.2 billion of its Common Stock and paid $684.7 million in cash dividends, returning approximately $1.9 billion to stockholders.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

---------------------------------

Consolidated Statements of Income

The following table presents a summary of the changes in total revenues during the last two years:

----------------------------- ------------------- -------- ------------------- ----- - --------

(In millions) 2017Compared to2016 2016Compared to2015
Total revenues — prior year $ 11,026.1 $ 10,996.4
Organic growth 489.3 125.7
Acquisition 247.2 —
Impact of foreign currency 48.6 (96.0 )
Total revenues — current year $ 11,811.2 $ 11,026.1

2017 compared to 2016

VF reported a 7% increase in revenues in 2017. The 2017 results were driven by an increase in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and continued strength in our direct-to-consumer and international businesses. The increase was also attributable to growth in the Imagewear coalition, which included a $247.2 million contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, which closed on October 2, 2017. These increases were offset by declines in the Jeanswear coalition. International sales grew in every region in 2017.

2016 compared to 2015

VF reported revenues in 2016 that were in line with 2015 revenues. The 2016 results were primarily attributable to a 2% increase in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and continued strength in the international and direct-to-consumer businesses, which offset foreign currency headwinds of 1% and softness in our Jeanswear and Imagewear coalitions. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency, international sales grew in every region in 2016.
Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “Information by Business Segment”.
The following table presents the percentage relationship to total revenues for components of the Consolidated Statements of Income:

----------------------------------------------------- ---- - ---- ---- ---- ---- -

 2017 2016 2015
Gross margin (total revenues less cost of goods sold) 50.5 % 49.3 % 49.0 %
Selling, general and administrative expenses 37.8 36.2 34.1
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets — 0.7 —
Operating income 12.7 % 12.4 % 15.0 %

22 VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K

2017 compared to 2016

Gross margin improved 120 basis points to 50.5% in 2017 compared to 49.3% in 2016, reflecting a 180 basis point benefit from pricing, a mix-shift toward higher margin businesses and lower restructuring costs, which was partially offset by a 60 basis point impact from foreign currency.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 160 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. This increase is primarily due to investments in our key growth priorities, which include direct-to-consumer, product innovation, demand creation and technology initiatives. The increases were offset by lower restructuring costs in 2017 and a pension settlement charge of $50.9 million in 2016, which did not recur in 2017.
In 2017, operating margin increased 30 basis points, to 12.7% from 12.4% in 2016. In addition to the items described above, the increase in operating margin reflects a 70 basis point increase from goodwill and intangible asset impairments in 2016 that did not recur in 2017.
Net interest expense increased $0.3 million to $85.9 million in 2017. The increase in net interest expense was due to higher interest rates on short-term borrowings and higher interest on long-term debt balances due to a full year of interest on the €850 million euro-denominated 0.625% fixed-rate notes issued in September 2016, which were partially offset by the payoff of the $250.0 million of 5.95% fixed-rate notes on November 1, 2017 and an increase in international short-term investment rates.
Outstanding interest-bearing debt averaged $3.2 billion for 2017 compared to $2.6 billion for 2016, with short-term borrowings representing 27% and 37% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt were 3.1% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2016, as the impact of the issuance of €850 million euro-denominated 0.625% fixed-rate notes in September of 2016 was offset by higher short-term debt rates.
Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, the funding fee charged on the sale of our trade receivables and non-operating gains and losses. Other income (expense) netted to $(0.7) million and $2.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The effective income tax rate was 49.1% in 2017 compared to 16.0% in 2016. The effective income tax rate is substantially higher in 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily due to discrete tax expense associated with the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduces the federal tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21% and moves from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime. As part of the legislation, U.S. companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not been repatriated to the U.S. Additionally, revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability positions at the lower federal base rate of 21% is also required. The transitional impact of the Tax Act resulted in a provisional net charge of $465.5 million, or $1.15 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2017. This amount, which is included in the income taxes line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, is primarily comprised of approximately $512.4 million related to the transition tax and approximately $89.5 million tax benefit related to revaluing U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. Other provisional charges of $42.6 million were primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax on

foreign income and dividends and establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes.
The 2017 effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax expense of $438.9 million, which included the provisional net charge of $465.5 million related to the Tax Act, $25.2 million of tax benefits related to stock compensation, $2.9 million of net tax benefit related to the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits and interest, and $1.9 million of discrete tax expense related to the effects of tax rate changes, exclusive of the Tax Act. The $438.9 million net discrete tax expense in 2017 increased the effective income tax rate by 31.0% compared to a favorable 3.4% impact of discrete items in 2016. Without discrete items, the effective tax rate during 2017 decreased by approximately 1.3% primarily due to the negative tax impact related to the 2016 goodwill impairment. The international effective tax rate was 13.1% and 10.9% for 2017 and 2016, respectively.
As a result of the above, net income in 2017 was $0.7 billion ($1.79 per diluted share), compared to $1.1 billion ($2.56 per diluted share) in 2016.
2016 compared to 2015
In 2016, gross margin improved 30 basis points, reflecting a 130 basis point benefit from pricing, lower product costs and a mix-shift toward higher margin businesses, which was partially offset by a 20 basis point impact from restructuring activities and a negative 80 basis point impact from foreign currency.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 210 basis points compared to 2015. This increase was primarily due to restructuring initiatives of $31.8 million, a pension settlement charge of $50.9 million, investments in our key growth priorities, which include direct-to-consumer, product innovation, demand creation and technology initiatives and the benefit of a $16.6 million gain on the sale of a VF Outlet® location in 2015.
As a result of management’s decision to merge the lucy® brand into The North Face® brand, VF recorded a $79.6 million noncash impairment charge to write-off the goodwill and intangible assets of the lucy® reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2016. For additional information, refer to Notes G, H and U to the consolidated financial statements and the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section below.
In 2016, operating margin decreased 260 basis points, to 12.4% from 15.0% in 2015. The decrease in operating margin reflects a 170 basis point decrease from goodwill and intangible asset impairment, restructuring, and pension settlement charges that did not occur in 2015, a negative 60 basis point impact from changes in foreign currency and investments in our key growth priorities, which include direct-to-consumer, product innovation, demand creation and technology initiatives.
In 2016, net interest expense increased $3.9 million to $85.5 million primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term borrowings and an increase in long-term debt due to the issuance of €850 million euro-denominated 0.625% fixed-rate notes in September 2016.
Outstanding interest-bearing debt averaged $2.6 billion for 2016 and $2.4 billion for 2015, with short-term borrowings representing 37% and 42% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 3.5% in both 2016 and 2015, as the impact of the issuance of €850 million

VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K 23

euro-denominated 0.625% fixed-rate notes in September of 2016 was offset by higher short-term debt rates.
Other income (expense) netted to $2.0 million and $1.0 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The effective income tax rate was 16.0% in 2016 compared to 22.2% in 2015. The 2016 tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of $43.1 million, which included $27.9 million of tax benefits related to the early adoption of the accounting standards update on stock compensation, $13.2 million of net tax benefits related to the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits and interest, and $4.1 million of discrete tax expense related to the effects of tax rate changes. The $43.1 million net discrete tax benefit in 2016 reduced the effective income tax rate by 3.4% compared to a favorable 2.8% impact of discrete items in 2015. Without discrete items, the effective tax rate during 2016 decreased by approximately 5.6% primarily due to i) a higher percentage of

foreign earnings in 2016, ii) the comparative impact of tax benefits recorded in 2016 related to the utilization of foreign tax attributes, iii) the full year benefits of the federal research tax credit and other incentives signed into law in December 2015 and iv) the negative tax impact related to the 2016 goodwill impairment. The international effective tax rate was 10.9% and 12.5% for 2016 and 2015, respectively.
As a result of the above, net income in 2016 was $1.1 billion ($2.56 per diluted share) compared to $1.2 billion ($2.82 per diluted share) in 2015. The decrease in diluted earnings per share in 2016 compared to 2015 was the result of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges ($0.15 per share), restructuring charges ($0.10 per share) and a pension settlement charge ($0.07 per share).

The Outdoor & Action Sports coalition includes the following brands: Vans®, The North Face®, Timberland®, Kipling®, Napapijri®, JanSport®, Reef®, Smartwool®, Eastpak®, lucy® and Eagle Creek®.

2017 compared to 2016
Global revenues for Outdoor & Action Sports increased 8% in 2017, driven by growth in the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency. The direct-to-consumer growth was driven by strong e-commerce and comparable store growth. Revenues in the Americas region increased 5% in 2017, reflecting 13% growth in the non-U.S. Americas region, which included a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency, and 4% growth in the U.S. Revenues in Europe increased 14%, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency. Revenues in the Asia-Pacific region increased 7% in 2017, including a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency.
Vans® brand global revenues increased 19% in 2017, reflecting strong operational growth in both the direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels. The growth in the direct-to-consumer channel was driven by strong comparable store and e-commerce growth.
Global revenues for The North Face® brand increased 4% in 2017, as growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, driven by comparable store and e-commerce growth, and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency, were partially offset by relatively flat wholesale revenues. Global wholesale revenues for The North Face® brand were tempered by U.S. retailer bankruptcies, lower year-over-year off-price shipments and efforts to manage inventory levels in certain markets.
Global revenues for the Timberland® brand increased 2% in 2017, as growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, driven by comparable store and e-commerce growth, and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency, were partially offset by relatively flat wholesale revenues.
Global direct-to-consumer revenues for Outdoor & Action Sports grew 17% in 2017, driven by an expanding e-commerce business, comparable store growth and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency. Wholesale revenues increased 2% in 2017, driven by growth in the Vans® brand and Europe, partially offset by the above-mentioned U.S. retailer bankruptcies, lower year-over-year off-price shipments and efforts to manage inventory levels in certain markets.
Operating margin increased 50 basis points in 2017 despite a negative impact from foreign currency. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, gross margin expansion, driven by a mix-shift to higher margin businesses, pricing and lower product costs, was partially offset by increased investments in direct-to-consumer, product and innovation, demand creation and technology.

2016 compared to 2015
Global revenues for Outdoor & Action Sports increased 2% in 2016, reflecting strong growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, partially offset by weakness in the U.S. wholesale channel. Revenues in the Americas region were consistent with 2015, and revenues in the Asia-Pacific region increased 4% in 2016 despite a 2% negative impact from foreign currency. European revenues increased 5% in 2016, representing operational growth of 4% and a favorable impact from foreign currency of 1%.
Vans® brand global revenues were up 6% in 2016, reflecting strong operational growth in the direct-to-consumer channel, partially offset by declines in the wholesale channel and a negative 1% impact from foreign currency.
Global revenues for The North Face® brand decreased 2% in 2016, as strong operational growth in the direct-to-consumer channel was more than offset by declines in the wholesale channel in the U.S. and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 1%. The wholesale revenue declines for The North Face® brand were attributable to retailer bankruptcies and management’s proactive approach to managing inventory levels in the market by reducing off-price shipments in the U.S. during the fourth quarter. The combination of both factors negatively impacted revenue growth for the year by approximately 4%.
Global revenues for the Timberland® brand were up 1% in 2016 driven by growth in the direct-to-consumer channel and international business, partially offset by weaker wholesale revenues in the U.S.
Global direct-to-consumer revenues for Outdoor & Action Sports grew 12% in 2016, driven by new store openings and an expanding e-commerce business, partially offset by an unfavorable 1% impact from foreign currency. Wholesale revenues were down 4% in 2016, primarily due to retailer bankruptcies and reduced off-price shipments in the U.S., and a negative impact from foreign currency of 1%.
Operating margin decreased 90 basis points in 2016 as the negative impact from foreign currency, increased investments in direct-to-consumer, product development and innovation and restructuring charges more than offset the benefits of favorable pricing and lower product costs.

Operating margin 15.9 % 18.0 % 19.2 %

The Jeanswear coalition consists of the global jeanswear businesses, led by the Wrangler® and Lee® brands.

2017 compared to 2016
Global Jeanswear revenues decreased 3% in 2017 compared to 2016, as growth in the direct-to-consumer channel was more than offset by U.S. wholesale declines in the mass, mid-tier and department store channels. Specifically, our U.S. wholesale business has been impacted by a key customer's inventory destocking decision and continued channel consolidation, which was partially mitigated by strong growth with our digital wholesale partners. Revenues in the Americas region decreased 4% in 2017, driven by softness in the wholesale channel. Revenues in the Asia-Pacific region decreased 3% in 2017 due to declines in the wholesale channel in Asia and India, partially offset by growth in the direct-to-consumer channel in Asia. European revenues increased 4% in 2017 due to growth in our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency.
Global revenues for the Wrangler® brand decreased 1% in 2017, driven by declines in the U.S. mass and western specialty businesses. Global revenues for the Lee® brand were down 6% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to declines in the U.S. mid-tier and department store channels, which were partially offset by growth in the direct-to-consumer channel.
Operating margin decreased 210 basis points in 2017 over 2016, primarily due to lower revenues, gross margin contraction from higher product costs and additional investments in our strategic growth priorities.

2016 compared to 2015
Global Jeanswear revenues decreased 2% in 2016 compared to 2015, due to a 2% negative impact from foreign currency. Revenues in the Americas region decreased 2% in 2016, due to a 2% negative impact from foreign currency. Revenues in the Asia-Pacific region decreased 4% in 2016, driven by a 5% negative impact from foreign currency. European revenues increased 3% in 2016, including a 1% negative impact from foreign currency.
Global revenues for the Wrangler® brand decreased 1% in 2016, as 1% operational growth, which was tempered by aggressive inventory management by key retailers, was offset by a negative 2% impact from foreign currency. Global revenues for the Lee® brand were down 3% in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by a negative 2% impact from foreign currency and softness in the U.S. mid-tier channel.
Operating margin decreased 120 basis points in 2016 over 2015, primarily due to lower gross margin largely driven by restructuring charges and higher product costs as a result of lower production volumes.

The Imagewear coalition consists of occupational apparel and uniform product categories including the Red Kap® and Bulwark® brand industrial businesses, as well as the workwear apparel brands from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition including Dickies®, Workrite®, Kodiak®, Terra® and Walls®. The Imagewear coalition also includes the results of certain transition services related to the sale of the Licensed Sports Group (the "LSG transition services") that commenced in the second quarter of 2017.

2017 compared to 2016
Global Imagewear revenues increased 50% in 2017 compared to 2016. Included in these 2017 results are revenues from the LSG transition services of $19.9 million and revenues from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition of $247.2 million. Excluding revenues from the LSG transition services and Williamson-Dickie, Imagewear revenues increased 2% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to growth in our Bulwark® brand, which was fueled by increased oil and gas exploration activities, mostly offset by industry consolidation.
Operating margin decreased 530 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. Excluding the impact of the LSG transition services and the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, operating margin in 2017 decreased 250 basis points. The decrease was driven by lower gross margin attributable to business mix and higher inventory costs and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

2016 compared to 2015
Imagewear revenues decreased 4% in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to continued weakness in the industrial manufacturing and energy sectors, which negatively impacted sales of the Bulwark® and Red Kap® brands.
The 60 basis point increase in operating margin in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by improved gross margin, primarily due to favorable pricing, product mix and foreign currency impacts, partially offset by restructuring charges.

VF Outlet® stores in the U.S. sell both VF and non-VF products. Revenues and profits of VF products sold in these stores are reported as part of the operating results of the applicable coalition, while revenues and profits of non-VF products are reported in this “other” category. The improvement in profit and operating margin

in 2017 was due to no restructuring charges during the year. The decrease in profit and operating margin in 2016 was primarily due to a $16.6 million gain recognized on the sale of a VF Outlet® location during 2015 and restructuring charges of $1.3 million in 2016.

Reconciliation of Coalition Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes

There are three types of costs necessary to reconcile total coalition profit to consolidated income before income taxes. These costs are (i) impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which is excluded from coalition profit because these costs are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses, (ii) interest expense, net, which is excluded from coalition profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not

under the control of coalition management, and (iii) corporate and other expenses, discussed below, which are excluded from coalition profit to the extent they are not allocated to the coalitions. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and net interest expense are discussed in the “Consolidated Statements of Income” section, and corporate and other expenses are discussed below.

VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K 27

Following is a summary of VF’s corporate and other expenses:

------------------------------------------------------------ ------ ----- ---- ------ ---- ----- ------ - - -----

(In millions) 2017 2016 2015
Information systems and shared services $ 365.0 $ 333.0 $ 307.6
Less costs allocated to coalitions (228.4 ) (213.9 ) (190.8 )
Information systems and shared services retained atcorporate 136.6 119.1 116.8
Corporate headquarters’ costs 218.4 169.1 138.1
Other 53.0 96.2 44.3
Corporate and other expenses $ 408.0 $ 384.4 $ 299.2

Information Systems and Shared Services
These costs include management information systems and the centralized finance, supply chain, human resources, direct-to-consumer and customer management functions that support worldwide operations. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the coalitions based on utilization of those services. Costs to develop new computer applications are generally not allocated to the coalitions. The increases in information systems and shared services costs in 2017 and 2016 primarily resulted from the costs associated with software system implementations and upgrades and other strategic projects.
Corporate Headquarters’ Costs
Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the coalitions. The increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by higher strategic project costs, an increase in cash and stock-based

compensation expense and charitable contributions. The increase in corporate headquarters’ costs in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by restructuring initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2016 and higher cash and stock-based compensation expense.
Other
This category includes (i) costs of corporate programs or corporate-managed decisions that are not allocated to the coalitions, (ii) costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of VF’s trademarks, and (iii) miscellaneous consolidated costs, the most significant of which is related to the expense of VF’s centrally-managed U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The decrease in other expense in 2017 compared to 2016 and the increase in other expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was largely driven by a $50.9 million settlement charge in 2016 related to our U.S. pension obligation, resulting from offering former employees a one-time option to receive a lump sum distribution of their deferred vested benefits.

------------------------

International Operations

International revenues increased 12% in 2017 compared to an increase of 3% in 2016. Foreign currency favorably impacted international revenue growth by 1% in 2017 and negatively impacted growth by 3% in 2016. Revenues in Europe increased 15% in 2017, reflecting operational growth and a 2% benefit from foreign currency. In the Asia-Pacific region, revenues increased 6%

primarily driven by strong growth across the region, particularly in China. Revenues in the Americas (non-U.S.) region grew 13%, reflecting operational growth and a 1% benefit from foreign currency. International revenues represented 41% and 40% of total VF revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

-----------------------------

Direct-to-Consumer Operations

Direct-to-consumer revenues grew 17% in 2017 compared to growth of 10% in 2016, reflecting growth in all regions and in nearly every brand with a retail format. Foreign currency favorably impacted direct-to-consumer revenue growth by 1% in 2017 and negatively impacted direct-to-consumer growth by 1% in 2016. The increase in direct-to-consumer revenues in both periods was due to comparable store growth for locations open at least twelve

 months at each reporting date, and an expanding e-commerce business which grew 34% and 23% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. VF opened 111 stores in 2017, bringing the total number of VF-owned retail stores to 1,518 at December 2017. Direct-to-consumer revenues were 32% of total VF revenues in 2017 compared to 29% in 2016.

Balance Sheets

The Williamson-Dickie acquisition significantly impacted the December 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accordingly, the table below presents the December 2017 balance sheet accounts excluding the Williamson-Dickie balances at that date so that the remaining VF balances are comparable with the December 2016 balances.

--------------------------------- ------------- --------- ----------------- ------------- ------------------------------ ------- --------- ----------- - --------- --------- - ---------

Unless noted otherwise, the discussion that follows relates to VF's businesses excluding the Williamson-Dickie balances at December 2017. The discussion refers to significant changes in balances at December 2017 compared to December 2016:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in accounts receivable — primarily due to higher wholesale shipments in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in inventories — driven by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in intangible assets and goodwill — driven by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decrease in other assets — primarily due to the cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of a deferred charge upon the early adoption of the accounting standards update regarding intra-entity asset transfers; partially offset by an increase in net pension assets for certain defined benefit plans and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in short-term borrowings — due to the increase in commercial paper borrowings primarily related to the funding of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decrease in current portion of long-term debt — due to the repayment of $250.0 million of notes that matured during the year.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in accounts payable — primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and payments to vendors and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in accrued liabilities — primarily due to changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities related to foreign exchange contracts, an increase in accrued income taxes related to the current portion of the transition tax related to the Tax Act and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in long-term debt — due to foreign currency fluctuations of euro-denominated bonds.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in other liabilities — primarily due to an increase in accrued income taxes from the noncurrent portion of the transition tax related to the Tax Act, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income tax liabilities resulting from revaluation at the lower U.S. corporate rate required by the Tax Act.

Liquidity and Cash Flows

The financial condition of VF is reflected in the following:

--------------------- -------- --------

(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016
Working capital $1,355.6 $2,383.2
Current ratio 1.5 to 1 2.4 to 1
Debt to total capital 44.0% 31.9%

For the ratio of debt to total capital, debt is defined as short-term and long-term borrowings, and total capital is defined as debt plus stockholders’ equity. The increase in the debt to total capital ratio at December 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by the decrease in total long-term debt, as discussed in “Balance Sheets” above. In addition, VF repurchased $1.2 billion of stock and paid $684.7 million in dividends in 2017, which reduced stockholders’ equity by $1.9 billion. Stockholder's equity was also reduced by $237.8 million related to the cumulative-effect adjustment upon the early adoption of the accounting standards update regarding intra-entity

asset transfers and the impact of the $465.5 million provisional net charge related to the Tax Act.
VF’s primary source of liquidity is the strong annual cash flow provided by operating activities. Cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the year. Cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Additionally, direct-to-consumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the year.
In summary, our cash flows were as follows:

------------------------------------- -------- ------- ---- -------- ---- ------- ------ - - -------

(In millions) 2017 2016 2015
Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,474.7 $ 1,480.6 $ 1,203.6
Cash used by investing activities (776.3 ) (112.4 ) (322.8 )
Cash used by financing activities (1,363.0 ) (1,076.9 ) (840.2 )

The cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated, and are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Accordingly, the information in the table above and cash flow discussion below include the results of continuing and discontinued operations.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Cash flow provided by operating activities is dependent on the level of net income, adjustments to net income and changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities remained relatively flat as lower net income was offset by working capital changes primarily related to an increase in accrued income tax payable resulting from the Tax Act.
Cash provided by operating activities increased $277.0 million in 2016 primarily due to i) a $250.0 million discretionary contribution to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2015 that did not recur in 2016, and ii) a decrease in net cash usage from working capital changes due in part to higher collections of accounts receivable and lower increases of inventory, partially offset by higher levels of cash tax payments compared to 2015.
Cash Used by Investing Activities
VF’s investing activities in 2017 related primarily to the Williamson-Dickie acquisition of $740.5 million, net of cash received. Additionally, the activities included $215.0 million of proceeds from the sale of LSG, which is $99.0 million higher than the proceeds received from the sale of the Contemporary Brands coalition in 2016. Capital expenditures of $169.6 million and software purchases of $65.2 million offset the proceeds received. Capital expenditures decreased $6.3 million compared to 2016. Software purchases increased $21.0 million in 2017 primarily due to system implementations and investments in our digital platform.
VF’s investing activities in 2016 related primarily to capital expenditures of $175.8 million and software purchases of $44.2 million, partially offset by $116.0 million of proceeds from the sale of its Contemporary Brands coalition. Capital expenditures

decreased $78.7 million compared to 2015 primarily due to the purchase in 2015 of a headquarters building in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Software purchases decreased $19.1 million in 2016 primarily due to the completion of a major system implementation that incurred significant costs through the middle of 2015.
Cash Used by Financing Activities
The increase in cash used by financing activities in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven by i) no long-term debt borrowings in 2017 compared to $951.8 million in proceeds during 2016, ii) the $250.0 million repayment of long-term debt discussed in "Balance Sheets" above, iii) a $199.9 million increase in purchases of treasury stock, and iv) a $48.7 million increase in cash dividends paid. These increases were partially offset by the $1.1 billion increase in net cash generated by short-term borrowings as discussed in “Balance Sheets” above.
The increase in cash used by financing activities in 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by i) the $853.3 million net decrease in short-term borrowings, ii) a $267.8 million increase in purchases of treasury stock and iii) a $70.7 million increase in cash dividends paid. These increases were partially offset by $951.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, VF purchased 22.2 million, 15.9 million and 10.0 million shares, respectively, of its Common Stock in open market transactions. The respective cost was $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion and $732.6 million with an average price per share of $54.04 in 2017, $62.80 in 2016 and $73.00 in 2015.
In March 2017, VF's Board of Directors approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the 2013 authorization. As of

30 VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K

the end of 2017, VF has purchased 14.0 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a total cost of $762.1 million (average price per share of $54.46) under the new share repurchase authorization, and had $4.2 billion remaining for future repurchases. VF will continue to evaluate its use of capital, giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
VF relied on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations. In addition, VF has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities. VF maintains a $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”). The Global Credit Facility expires in April 2020 and VF may request two extensions of one year each, subject to stated terms and conditions. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in both U.S. dollar and certain non-U.S. dollar currencies, and has a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit. In addition, the Global Credit Facility supports VF’s U.S. commercial paper program for short-term, seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility are priced at a credit spread of 80.5 basis points over the appropriate LIBOR benchmark for each currency. VF is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders, currently equal to 7.0 basis points of the committed amount of the facility. The credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on VF’s credit ratings.
VF has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to $2.25 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. Commercial paper borrowings and standby letters of credit issued as of December 2017 were $705.0 million and $15.3 million, respectively, leaving $1.5 billion available for borrowing against the Global Credit Facility at December 2017.
VF has $267.0 million of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time

by either VF or the banks. Total outstanding balances under these arrangements were $24.4 million and $26.0 million at December 2017 and 2016, respectively. Borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 9.9% and 7.2% at December 2017 and 2016, respectively, excluding accepted letters of credit which are non-interest bearing to VF.
VF repaid $250.0 million of 5.95% fixed-rate notes on November 1, 2017, using a combination of operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings.
VF’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates. At the end of 2017, VF’s long-term debt ratings were ‘A’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and ‘A3’ by Moody’s Investors Service, and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘A-1’ and ‘Prime-2’, respectively. None of VF’s long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2021, 2023 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
Cash dividends totaled $1.72 per share in 2017, compared to $1.53 in 2016 and $1.33 in 2015. The dividend payout ratio was 96.2% of diluted earnings per share in 2017, 59.9% in 2016 and 47.2% in 2015. Based on the quarterly dividend in place, the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2018 is $1.84 per share.

Following is a summary of VF’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2017 that will require the use of funds:

-------------------------------- ----- ----- ------------------------------------------ ----- - ----- ---- ---- --- ---- ---------- --- -- - --- --- - --- - -----

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Long-term debt consists of required principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for long-term liabilities in VF’s Consolidated Balance Sheet related to deferred compensation and other employee-related benefits, product warranty claims and other liabilities. These amounts are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. Amounts exclude liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits and deferred income taxes.

Obligations under our qualified defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan are not included in the table above. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in Note N to the consolidated financial statements. We currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately $35.1 million to our pension plans during calendar year 2018. Future contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes

VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K 31

in tax and other benefit laws, changes to the plan, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on long-term debt and the interest portion of payments on capital leases. Amounts exclude amortization of debt issuance costs, debt discounts and acquisition costs that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments during the noncancelable lease term. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance, which are not included above.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Minimum royalty payments represent obligations under license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties and include required minimum advertising commitments. Actual payments could exceed minimum royalty obligations.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor that are payable upon delivery of the inventory to VF. This obligation excludes the amount included in accounts payable at December 2017 related to inventory purchases.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects, and (iii) amounts related to the definitive merger agreement to acquire 100% of the stock of Icebreaker Holdings, Ltd.

VF had other financial commitments at the end of 2017 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $123.9 million of surety bonds, custom bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees are not included in the above table because they represent contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other programs and would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its other obligations.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business are not included in the above table because they represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments.

Management believes that VF’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as its Global Credit Facility, additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend payout rate, and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise.
VF does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

---------------

Risk Management

VF is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. Management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of natural hedges within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers, or (iii) using derivative financial instruments. Some potential risks are discussed below:
Insured risks
VF is self-insured for a significant portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability exposures. VF purchases insurance from highly-rated commercial carriers to cover other risks, including directors and officers, property and umbrella, and to establish stop-loss limits on self-insurance arrangements.
Cash and equivalents risks
VF had $566.1 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2017. Management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom VF conducts business. Similarly, management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents.
Defined benefit pension plan risks
At the end of 2017, VF’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a net total of $134.2 million. The underfunded status includes a $162.0 million liability related to our unfunded U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plan, $48.5 million of net liabilities related to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, and a $76.3 million asset related to our U.S. qualified defined benefit

plan. VF has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of its plans, including a discretionary contribution to the U.S. qualified plan of $250.0 million in 2015. VF will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans, which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios. Management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years.
VF’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense, which has ranged in recent years from $34.8 million in 2017 to $113.0 million in 2016, including the $50.9 million settlement charge discussed below. These fluctuations are primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense. The assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans, the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants.
During 2016, VF took an additional step in managing pension risk by offering former employees in the U.S. qualified plan a one-time option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits, pursuant to which the plan paid $197.1 million in lump-sum distributions to settle $224.7 million of projected benefit obligations.  The Company recorded $50.9 million in settlement charges during 2016 to recognize the related deferred actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). No additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were paid out of existing plan assets, and the plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged as a result of this offer. However, assuming other key assumptions remain

32 VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K

unchanged, pension expense will decrease in future years due to lower amortization of net deferred actuarial losses. Refer to Note N to the consolidated financial statements and the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section below.
VF has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. In 2005, VF’s U.S. defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits. In more recent years, the investment strategy of the U.S. qualified plan has been revised to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status, capital market expectations, and risk tolerance. Additionally, VF completed the one-time lump-sum offering noted above during 2016 which reduced the number of plan participants in the U.S. qualified plan by 23%. Management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce VF’s risks related to its defined benefit plans.
Interest rate risks
VF limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, VF may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk. Since all of VF’s long-term debt has fixed interest rates, the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short-term borrowings (which averaged approximately $870 million during 2017). However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VF’s cash equivalents. Based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2017, the effect of a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately $3.6 million.
Foreign currency exchange rate risks
VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 41% of VF’s revenues in 2017 were generated in international markets. Most of VF’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In periods where the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where VF has operations, there is a negative impact on VF’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. As discussed later in this section, management hedges VF’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions.
The reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For net advances to and investments in VF’s foreign businesses that are considered to be long-term, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those long-term advances is deferred as a component of accumulated OCI in stockholders’ equity. The U.S. dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies. On September 20, 2016, VF issued €850 million of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes which it has designated as a net investment hedge of VF’s investment in certain foreign operations. Because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument, foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated OCI as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments. Any amounts deferred in accumulated OCI will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.
VF monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of

exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions (relating to cross-border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales, operating costs and intercompany royalty payments). VF’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80% of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months. Currently, VF uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future. This use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on VF’s cash flows and earnings, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged.
For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2017, if there were a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of 2017, it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately $230 million. However, any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes.
Counterparty risks
VF is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘A minus/A3’ investment grade credit ratings or better. VF continually monitors the credit rating of, and limits the amount hedged with, each counterparty. Additionally, management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary. VF also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans.
Commodity price risks
VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton, leather, rubber, wool and other materials, which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles. To manage risks of commodity price changes, management negotiates prices in advance when possible. VF has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments.
Deferred compensation and related investment security risks
VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds, including VF Common Stock. VF invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections. The increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities (except for the participants’ investment selections in VF Common Stock) are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VF’s investments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position. The VF Common Stock is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes, so any gains or losses on those shares result in exposure to operating results and financial position as a result of the corresponding change in participant liabilities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

VF has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. VF applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the consolidated financial statements.
The application of these accounting policies requires that VF make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because VF’s business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date

that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, VF may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension benefits and self-insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known.
VF believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates, assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. The application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

-----------

Inventories

VF’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. VF performs a detailed review at each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style-size-color stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. Management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand, market conditions and selling prices

less costs of disposal. If the estimated net realizable value is less than cost, VF provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to VF’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories.
Existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations throughout the year. VF provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill

VF allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. VF evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques - the replacement cost, market and income methods - and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective.
Fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows. Indefinite-lived trademark or trade name intangible assets (collectively referred to herein as “trademarks”) represent individually acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in multiple countries. Definite-lived customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition. Definite-lived license intangible assets relate to VF's licensing contracts with customers. Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and is assigned at the reporting unit level.
VF’s depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment reflect judgments on their estimated economic lives and residual value,

if any. VF’s amortization policies for definite-lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers. For license-related intangible assets, management considers historical trends and anticipated license renewal periods.
VF’s policy is to review property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. VF tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. VF measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value, a fair value analysis must be performed, and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

34 VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K

When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. Management uses the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method, to value customer relationship assets. Under this method, VF calculates the present value of the after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges.
VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. As part of its annual impairment testing, VF may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the intangible asset or reporting unit must be quantitatively tested for impairment.
An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value of an indefinite-lived trademark is based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. Under this method, forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership), and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark. The appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that considers market participant assumptions, plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset. The royalty rate is selected based on consideration of i) royalty rates included in active license agreements, if applicable, ii) royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry and iii) the current performance of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference.
Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by coalition management.
For goodwill impairment testing, VF estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s WACC as discussed above. For the market-based approach, management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods. The guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies. The market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies. Under the similar transactions method, valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual

transaction prices and revenue/EBITDA data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit.
Based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and market-based methods, VF determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. However, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, VF calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value.
The income-based fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which VF operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management’s control. At the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for at least a 10-year forecast period.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. The terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount rate may consider any company-specific risk in achieving the prospective financial information.

Under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of VF’s reporting units.
2017 impairment testing
During the third quarter of 2017, management determined that there had been a triggering event related to the Nautica® brand reporting unit that required an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets. VF early adopted the accounting standard update that permits a single step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was compared to the carrying value, and a $104.7 million goodwill impairment was recorded in the third quarter of 2017. The Nautica® brand reporting unit has since been reported in discontinued operations.
Management performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017. Management performed a qualitative analysis for all reporting units and trademark intangible assets, as discussed below in the “Qualitative impairment analysis” section.

VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K 35

Qualitative impairment analysis
For all reporting units, VF elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the goodwill and trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired. In this qualitative assessment, VF considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results, ii) financial performance versus management’s annual and five-year strategic plans, iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit. If applicable, performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, VF concluded that it was not more likely than not that the carrying values of the goodwill and trademark intangible assets were greater than their fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not necessary.
Management’s use of estimates and assumptions
Management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessment, using assumptions we believe

market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the business. It is possible that VF’s conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2018 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA.
A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on VF’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

-------------

Stock Options

VF uses a lattice option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. VF believes that a lattice model provides a refined estimate of the fair value of options because it can incorporate (i) historical option exercise patterns and multiple assumptions about future option exercise patterns for each of several groups of option holders and (ii) inputs that vary over time, such as assumptions for interest rates and volatility. Management performs an annual review of all assumptions employed in the valuation of option grants and believes they are reflective of the outstanding options and underlying Common Stock and of groups of option participants. The lattice valuation incorporates the assumptions listed in Note P to the consolidated financial statements.
One of the critical assumptions in the valuation process is estimating the expected average life of the options before they are exercised. For each option grant, VF estimated the expected average life based on evaluations of the historical and expected

option exercise patterns for each of the groups of option holders that have historically exhibited different option exercise patterns. These evaluations included (i) voluntary stock option exercise patterns based on a combination of changes in the price of VF Common Stock and periods of time that options are outstanding before exercise and (ii) involuntary exercise patterns resulting from turnover, retirement and death.
Volatility is another critical assumption requiring judgment. Management bases its estimates of future volatility on a combination of implied and historical volatility. Implied volatility is based on short-term (6 to 9 months) publicly traded near-the-money options on VF Common Stock. VF measures historical volatility over a ten-year period, corresponding to the contractual term of the options, using daily stock prices. Management’s assumption for valuation purposes is that expected volatility starts at a level equal to the implied volatility and then transitions to the historical volatility over the remainder of the ten-year option term.

-------------------

Pension Obligations

VF sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full-time U.S. employees hired before 2005 and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of the limitations imposed by income tax regulations. VF also sponsors certain non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The selection of actuarial assumptions for determining the projected pension benefit liabilities and annual pension expense is significant due to amounts involved and the long time period over which benefits are accrued and paid.
Annually, management reviews the principal economic actuarial assumptions summarized in Note N to the consolidated financial statements, and revises them as appropriate based on current rates and trends as of the valuation date. VF also periodically reviews and revises, as necessary, other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, termination, disability and mortality. VF believes the assumptions appropriately

reflect the participants’ demographics and projected benefit obligations of the plans and result in the best estimate of the plans’ future experience. Actual results may vary from the actuarial assumptions used.
The below discussion of discount rate, return on assets and mortality assumptions relates specifically to the U.S. pension plans, as they comprise approximately 91% of VF’s total defined benefit plan assets and approximately 90% of VF’s total projected benefit obligations of the combined U.S. and international plans.
One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial model is the discount rate, which is used to estimate the present value of future cash outflows necessary to meet projected benefit obligations for the specific plan. It is the estimated interest rate that VF could use to settle its projected benefit obligations at the valuation date. The discount rate assumption is based on current market interest

36 VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K

rates. VF selects a discount rate for each of the U.S. pension plans by matching high quality corporate bond yields to the timing of projected benefit payments to participants in each plan. VF uses the population of U.S. corporate bonds rated ‘Aa’ by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services. VF excludes the highest and lowest yielding bonds from this population of approximately 623 such bonds having at least i) $500 million outstanding with 10 years or less to maturity or ii) $50 million outstanding with 10 years or more to maturity. The bonds must be noncallable/nonputable unless make-whole provisions exist. Each plan’s projected benefit payments are matched to current market interest rates over the expected payment period to calculate an associated present value. A single equivalent discount rate is then determined that produces the same present value. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan’s distinct liability characteristics. VF believes that those ‘Aa’ rated issues meet the “high quality” intent of the applicable accounting standards and that the 2017 discount rates of 3.66% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and 3.70% for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan appropriately reflect current market conditions and the long-term nature of projected benefit payments to participants in the U.S. pension plans. These lower discount rates, compared with the rates of 4.10% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and 4.14% for the unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan at the end of 2016, reflect the general decrease in yields of U.S. government obligations and high quality corporate bonds during 2017.
In 2015, VF adopted the spot rate approach to measure service and interest costs. Under the spot rate approach, the full yield curve is applied separately to cash flows for each projected benefit obligation, service cost, and interest cost for a more precise calculation.
Another critical assumption of the actuarial model is the expected long-term rate of return on investments. VF’s investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets with an acceptable level of risk to maximize the long-term return while minimizing volatility in the value of plan assets relative to the value of plan liabilities. These risks include market, interest rate, credit, liquidity, regulatory and foreign securities risks. Investment assets consist of U.S. and international equity, corporate and governmental fixed-income securities, insurance contracts, and alternative assets. VF develops a projected rate of return for each of the investment asset classes based on many factors, including historical and expected returns, the estimated inflation rate, the premium to be earned in excess of a risk-free return, the premium for equity risk and the premium for longer duration fixed-income securities. The weighted average projected long-term rates of return of the various assets held by the qualified plan provide the basis for the expected long-term rate of return actuarial assumption. VF’s rate of return assumption was 6.00% in 2017 and 2016 and 6.25% in 2015. In recent years, VF has altered the investment mix by (i) increasing the allocation to fixed-income investments and reducing the allocation to equity investments,

(ii) increasing the allocation in equities to more international investments and, (iii) adding alternative assets as an asset class. The changes in asset allocation are anticipated, over time, to reduce the year-to-year variability of the U.S. plan’s funded status and resulting pension expense. Management monitors the plan’s asset allocation to balance risk with anticipated investment returns in a given year. Based on an evaluation of market conditions and projected market returns, VF will be using a rate of return assumption of 6.00% for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan for 2018.
We consistently review all of our demographic assumptions as part of the normal management of our defined benefit plans, and update these assumptions as appropriate. The Company performed a demographic assumptions study in 2017 and updated the assumptions, as necessary, in the year end 2017 valuations.
In 2014, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued new mortality tables (RP-2014) and mortality improvement scales (MP-2014) which reflect longer life expectancies than the previous tables. In 2017, the SOA issued updated scales (MP-2017), which were adjusted for characteristics of our plan-specific populations and other data where appropriate, in developing our best estimate of the expected mortality rates of plan participants in the U.S. pension plans.
Differences between actual results in a given year and the actuarially determined assumed results for that year (e.g., investment performance, discount rates and other assumptions) do not affect that year’s pension expense, but instead are deferred as unrecognized actuarial gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At the end of 2017, there were $454.5 million of pretax accumulated deferred actuarial losses, plus $10.5 million of pretax deferred prior service costs, resulting in an after-tax amount of $291.9 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet. These deferred losses will be amortized as a component of pension expense.
Pension expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements was $34.8 million in 2017, $113.0 million in 2016 and $64.8 million in 2015. Pension expense for 2016 was higher as it included a $50.9 million settlement charge resulting from 9,400 participants accepting a one-time option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits (refer to Note N). The cost of pension benefits actually earned each year by covered active employees (commonly called “service cost”) was $24.9 million in 2017, $25.8 million in 2016 and $29.2 million in 2015. Pension expense was significantly lower in 2017 due to the $50.9 million settlement charge incurred in 2016, lower interest costs resulting from lower interest rates and lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses resulting from the 2016 one-time distribution. Looking forward, VF expects pension expense for the next 12 months to decrease to approximately $20.4 million which reflects lower amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses and higher expected return on plan assets.

VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K 37

The sensitivity of changes in actuarial assumptions on 2017 pension expense and on projected benefit obligations related to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2017, all other factors being equal, is illustrated by the following:

--------------------------------------------- ---------------------- -- ----------------------------- --- - ---

 Increase (Decrease) in
(Dollars in millions) Pension Expense Projected Benefit Obligations
0.50% decrease in discount rate $ 14 $ 104
0.50% increase in discount rate (14 ) (94 )
0.50% decrease in expected investment return 8 —
0.50% increase in expected investment return (8 ) —
0.50% decrease in rate of compensation change (1 ) (5 )
0.50% increase in rate of compensation change 1 5

As discussed in the “Risk Management” section above, VF has taken a series of steps to reduce volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. On a longer-term basis, VF believes the year-to-year variability of the retirement benefit expense should decrease.

------------

Income Taxes

As a global company, VF is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 U.S. and foreign jurisdictions each year. As discussed in Note Q to the consolidated financial statements, VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. VF makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which VF operates.
In February 2015, the European Union Commission (“EU”) opened a state aid investigation into rulings granted to companies under Belgium’s excess profit tax regime. On January 11, 2016, the EU announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies, including VF. The Belgian government and VF have each filed appeals seeking annulment of the EU decision. On January 10, 2017, VF Europe BVBA received an assessment for €31.9 million tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years and remitted €31.9 million ($33.9 million) on January 13, 2017. This was recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment. If this matter is adversely resolved, these amounts will not be collected by VF.
The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment. VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. VF has reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. VF has evaluated these potential issues under the “more-likely-than-not” standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent VF prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established, or to the extent VF is required

to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits. VF does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses.
VF has $286.0 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, and $212.9 million of valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws. If management believes that VF will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses during the carryforward periods, VF records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. If in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, VF would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act included a broad range of complex provisions impacting the taxation of multi-national companies. Generally, accounting for the impacts of newly enacted tax legislation is required to be completed in the period of enactment; however, in response to the complexities and ambiguity surrounding the Tax Act, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to provide companies with relief around the initial accounting for the Tax Act. Pursuant to SAB 118, the SEC has provided a one-year measurement period for companies to analyze and finalize accounting for the Tax Act. During the one-year measurement period, SAB 118 allows companies to recognize provisional amounts when reasonable estimates can be made for the impacts resulting from the Tax Act. VF will finalize accounting for the Tax Act during the one-year measurement period, and any adjustments to the provisional amounts will be included in income tax expense or benefit in the appropriate period, in accordance with guidance provided by SAB 118.
While our accounting for the Tax Act is not complete, we have recognized a provisional charge of approximately $465.5 million primarily comprised of approximately $512.4 million related to the transition tax and approximately $89.5 million related to revaluing U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using the new U.S. corporate

38 VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K

tax rate of 21%. Other provisional charges netting to $42.6 million were primarily related to U.S. federal and state tax on foreign income and dividends and establishing a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes.
The Tax Act has significant complexity and our final tax liability may differ materially from provisional estimates due to additional guidance and regulations that may be issued by the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and for VF’s finalization of the relevant calculations required by the new tax legislation.
VF continues to analyze the provisions of the Tax Act which are effective after December 30, 2017, including but not limited to, the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse

tax (“BEAT”); a new provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses (e.g. interest and general administrative expenses) as well as certain global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”) from foreign operations; a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and limitations on the deductibility of certain employee compensation. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S (“GAAP”), companies are allowed to make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes resulting from GILTI as a current-period expense when they are incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. The Company has not completed its analysis of the effects of the GILTI provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided under SAB 118.

['s Board of Directors approved a $5.0 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the 2013 authorization. As of

30 VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K

the end of 2017, VF has purchased 14.0 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a total cost of $762.1 million (average price per share of $54.46) under the new share repurchase authorization, and had $4.2 billion remaining for future repurchases. VF will continue to evaluate its use of capital, giving first priority to business acquisitions and then to direct shareholder return in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
VF relied on continued strong cash generation to finance its ongoing operations. In addition, VF has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities. VF maintains a $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”). The Global Credit Facility expires in April 2020 and VF may request two extensions of one year each, subject to stated terms and conditions. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in both U.S. dollar and certain non-U.S. dollar currencies, and has a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit. In addition, the Global Credit Facility supports VF’s U.S. commercial paper program for short-term, seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility are priced at a credit spread of 80.5 basis points over the appropriate LIBOR benchmark for each currency. VF is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders, currently equal to 7.0 basis points of the committed amount of the facility. The credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on VF’s credit ratings.
VF has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to $2.25 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. Commercial paper borrowings and standby letters of credit issued as of December 2017 were $705.0 million and $15.3 million, respectively, leaving $1.5 billion available for borrowing against the Global Credit Facility at December 2017.
VF has $267.0 million of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time

by either VF or the banks. Total outstanding balances under these arrangements were $24.4 million and $26.0 million at December 2017 and 2016, respectively. Borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 9.9% and 7.2% at December 2017 and 2016, respectively, excluding accepted letters of credit which are non-interest bearing to VF.
VF repaid $250.0 million of 5.95% fixed-rate notes on November 1, 2017, using a combination of operating cash flows and commercial paper borrowings.
VF’s favorable credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates. At the end of 2017, VF’s long-term debt ratings were ‘A’ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and ‘A3’ by Moody’s Investors Service, and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘A-1’ and ‘Prime-2’, respectively. None of VF’s long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2021, 2023 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.
Cash dividends totaled $1.72 per share in 2017, compared to $1.53 in 2016 and $1.33 in 2015. The dividend payout ratio was 96.2% of diluted earnings per share in 2017, 59.9% in 2016 and 47.2% in 2015. Based on the quarterly dividend in place, the current indicated annual dividend rate for 2018 is $1.84 per share.

Following is a summary of VF’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of 2017 that will require the use of funds:

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Long-term debt consists of required principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Other recorded liabilities represent payments due for long-term liabilities in VF’s Consolidated Balance Sheet related to deferred compensation and other employee-related benefits, product warranty claims and other liabilities. These amounts are based on historical and forecasted cash outflows. Amounts exclude liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits and deferred income taxes.

Obligations under our qualified defined benefit pension plans and unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan are not included in the table above. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in Note N to the consolidated financial statements. We currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately $35.1 million to our pension plans during calendar year 2018. Future contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes

VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K 31

in tax and other benefit laws, changes to the plan, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on long-term debt and the interest portion of payments on capital leases. Amounts exclude amortization of debt issuance costs, debt discounts and acquisition costs that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Operating leases represent required minimum lease payments during the noncancelable lease term. Most real estate leases also require payment of related operating expenses such as taxes, insurance, utilities and maintenance, which are not included above.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Minimum royalty payments represent obligations under license agreements to use trademarks owned by third parties and include required minimum advertising commitments. Actual payments could exceed minimum royalty obligations.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods, raw materials and sewing labor that are payable upon delivery of the inventory to VF. This obligation excludes the amount included in accounts payable at December 2017 related to inventory purchases.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) Other obligations represent other binding commitments for the expenditure of funds, including (i) amounts related to contracts not involving the purchase of inventories, such as the noncancelable portion of service or maintenance agreements for management information systems, (ii) capital expenditures for approved projects, and (iii) amounts related to the definitive merger agreement to acquire 100% of the stock of Icebreaker Holdings, Ltd.

VF had other financial commitments at the end of 2017 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $123.9 million of surety bonds, custom bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees are not included in the above table because they represent contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other programs and would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its other obligations.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business are not included in the above table because they represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments.

Management believes that VF’s cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, as well as its Global Credit Facility, additional borrowing capacity and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and to maintain the planned dividend payout rate, and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise.
VF does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.

---------------

Risk Management

VF is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. Management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of natural hedges within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers, or (iii) using derivative financial instruments. Some potential risks are discussed below:
Insured risks
VF is self-insured for a significant portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability exposures. VF purchases insurance from highly-rated commercial carriers to cover other risks, including directors and officers, property and umbrella, and to establish stop-loss limits on self-insurance arrangements.
Cash and equivalents risks
VF had $566.1 million of cash and equivalents at the end of 2017. Management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom VF conducts business. Similarly, management monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents.
Defined benefit pension plan risks
At the end of 2017, VF’s defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by a net total of $134.2 million. The underfunded status includes a $162.0 million liability related to our unfunded U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plan, $48.5 million of net liabilities related to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, and a $76.3 million asset related to our U.S. qualified defined benefit

plan. VF has made significant cash contributions in recent years to improve the funded status of its plans, including a discretionary contribution to the U.S. qualified plan of $250.0 million in 2015. VF will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans, which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios. Management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years.
VF’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension expense, which has ranged in recent years from $34.8 million in 2017 to $113.0 million in 2016, including the $50.9 million settlement charge discussed below. These fluctuations are primarily due to varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ expense. The assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans, the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants.
During 2016, VF took an additional step in managing pension risk by offering former employees in the U.S. qualified plan a one-time option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits, pursuant to which the plan paid $197.1 million in lump-sum distributions to settle $224.7 million of projected benefit obligations.  The Company recorded $50.9 million in settlement charges during 2016 to recognize the related deferred actuarial losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). No additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were paid out of existing plan assets, and the plan’s funded status remained materially unchanged as a result of this offer. However, assuming other key assumptions remain

32 VF Corporation 2017 Form 10-K

unchanged, pension expense will decrease in future years due to lower amortization of net deferred actuarial losses. Refer to Note N to the consolidated financial statements and the “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” section below.
VF has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements. In 2005, VF’s U.S. defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants, which did not affect the benefits of existing plan participants at that date or their accrual of future benefits. In more recent years, the investment strategy of the U.S. qualified plan has been revised to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status, capital market expectations, and risk tolerance. Additionally, VF completed the one-time lump-sum offering noted above during 2016 which reduced the number of plan participants in the U.S. qualified plan by 23%. Management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce VF’s risks related to its defined benefit plans.
Interest rate risks
VF limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, VF may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk. Since all of VF’s long-term debt has fixed interest rates, the exposure relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short-term borrowings (which averaged approximately $870 million during 2017). However, any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VF’s cash equivalents. Based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during 2017, the effect of a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately $3.6 million.
Foreign currency exchange rate risks
VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 41% of VF’s revenues in 2017 were generated in international markets. Most of VF’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In periods where the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where VF has operations, there is a negative impact on VF’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. As discussed later in this section, management hedges VF’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions.
The reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For net advances to and investments in VF’s foreign businesses that are considered to be long-term, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those long-term advances is deferred as a component of accumulated OCI in stockholders’ equity. The U.S. dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies. On September 20, 2016, VF issued €850 million of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes which it has designated as a net investment hedge of VF’s investment in certain foreign operations. Because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument, foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated OCI as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments. Any amounts deferred in accumulated OCI will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.
VF monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of

exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions (relating to cross-border inventory purchases, production costs, product sales, operating costs and intercompany royalty payments). VF’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80% of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months. Currently, VF uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future. This use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on VF’s cash flows and earnings, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset losses and gains on the transactions being hedged.
For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of 2017, if there were a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of 2017, it would result in a change in fair value of those contracts of approximately $230 million. However, any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes.
Counterparty risks
VF is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘A minus/A3’ investment grade credit ratings or better. VF continually monitors the credit rating of, and limits the amount hedged with, each counterparty. Additionally, management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary. VF also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans.
Commodity price risks
VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton, leather, rubber, wool and other materials, which we either purchase directly or in a converted form such as fabric or shoe soles. To manage risks of commodity price changes, management negotiates prices in advance when possible. VF has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments.
Deferred compensation and related investment security risks
VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds, including VF Common Stock. VF invests in a portfolio of securities that substantially mirrors the participants’ investment selections. The increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities (except for the participants’ investment selections in VF Common Stock) are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VF’s investments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position. The VF Common Stock is treated as treasury shares for financial reporting purposes, so any gains or losses on those shares result in exposure to operating results and financial position as a result of the corresponding change in participant liabilities.

------------------------------------------

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

VF has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. VF applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note A to the consolidated financial statements.
The application of these accounting policies requires that VF make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because VF’s business cycle is relatively short (i.e., from the date

that inventory is received until that inventory is sold and the trade receivable is collected), actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, VF may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, equity compensation, pension benefits and self-insured liabilities. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known.
VF believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates, assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. The application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

-----------

Inventories

VF’s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes all material, labor and overhead costs incurred to manufacture or purchase the finished goods. Overhead allocated to manufactured product is based on the normal capacity of plants and does not include amounts related to idle capacity or abnormal production inefficiencies. VF performs a detailed review at each business unit, at least quarterly, of all inventories on the basis of individual styles or individual style-size-color stock keeping units to identify slow moving or excess products, discontinued and to-be-discontinued products, and off-quality merchandise. This review matches inventory on hand, plus current production and purchase commitments, with current and expected future sales orders. Management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand, market conditions and selling prices

less costs of disposal. If the estimated net realizable value is less than cost, VF provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to VF’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories.
Existence of physical inventory is verified through periodic physical inventory counts and ongoing cycle counts at most locations throughout the year. VF provides for estimated inventory losses that have likely occurred since the last physical inventory date. Historically, physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill

VF allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. VF evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques - the replacement cost, market and income methods - and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective.
Fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows. Indefinite-lived trademark or trade name intangible assets (collectively referred to herein as “trademarks”) represent individually acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in multiple countries. Definite-lived customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers at the time of acquisition. Definite-lived license intangible assets relate to VF']:
NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
