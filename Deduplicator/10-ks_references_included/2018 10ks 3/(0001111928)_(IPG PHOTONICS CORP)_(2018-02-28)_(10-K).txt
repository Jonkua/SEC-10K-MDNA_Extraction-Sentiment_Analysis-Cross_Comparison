ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6, "Selected Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors."
Overview
We develop and manufacture a broad line of high-performance fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and diode lasers that are used in numerous applications, primarily in materials processing. We sell our products globally to OEMs, system integrators and end users. We market our products internationally primarily through our direct sales force.
We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture most of our key components used in our finished products, from semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also manufacture certain complementary products used with our lasers, including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical processing heads and chillers. In addition, we offer laser-based systems for certain markets and applications.
Description of Our Net Sales, Costs and Expenses
Net sales. We derive net sales primarily from the sale of fiber lasers and amplifiers. We also sell diode lasers, communications systems, laser systems and complementary products. We sell our products through our direct sales organization and our network of distributors and sales representatives, as well as system integrators. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials processing laser systems, communications systems, medical laser systems and other laser systems for advanced applications to end users. We also sell our products to end users that build their own systems which incorporate our products or use our products as an energy or light source. Our scientists and engineers work closely with OEMs, systems integrators and end users to analyze their system requirements and match appropriate fiber laser or amplifier specifications. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several months.
Sales of our products generally are recognized upon shipment, provided that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Our sales typically are made on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase commitments.
We develop our products to standard specifications and use a common set of components within our product architectures. Our major products are based upon a common technology platform. We continually enhance these and other products by improving their components and developing new components and new product designs.
The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as decreased manufacturing costs and increases in unit volumes, increased competition, the introduction of new products and market share considerations. In the past, we have lowered our selling prices in order to penetrate new

markets and applications. Furthermore, we may negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that purchase multiple units.
Cost of sales. Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead. We are vertically integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for our products as well as assemble finished products. We believe our vertical integration allows us to increase efficiencies, leverage our scale and lower our cost of sales. Cost of sales also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing, engineering and service operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, shipping costs and reserves for inventory obsolescence and for warranty obligations. Inventories are written off and charged to cost of sales when identified as excess or obsolete.
Due to our vertical integration strategy and ongoing investment in plant and machinery, we maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead. We may not be able to or choose not to adjust these fixed costs to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Our gross margin is therefore significantly affected by our sales volume and the corresponding utilization of capacity and absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses.
Sales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of costs related to compensation, trade shows, professional and technical conferences, travel, facilities, depreciation of equipment used for demonstration purposes and other marketing costs.
Research and development. Our research and development expense consists primarily of compensation, development expenses related to the design of our products and certain components, the cost of materials and components to build prototype devices for testing and facilities costs. Costs related to product development are recorded as research and development expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
General and administrative. Our general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, legal, information technology and other administrative personnel, outside legal and professional fees, insurance premiums and fees, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses such as charges and benefits related to the change in allowance for doubtful debt.
Factors and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results
In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance.
Net sales. Our net sales grew from $769.8 million in 2014 to $1,408.9 million in 2017, representing a three year compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. Net sales growth was driven by (i) increasing demand for our products, fueled by their superior performance and decreasing average cost per watt of output power which has resulted in a substantial improvement in their competitiveness and increased market share compared to other laser technologies including CO2 and YAG lasers, (ii) increased sales of fiber lasers for cutting and welding applications and the development of OEM customers in these applications. (iii) the introduction of new products, including our high power lasers with higher output power levels, quasi-continuous wave ("QCW") lasers, laser systems, high power pulsed lasers and optical heads and other accessories and (iv) the development of new applications for our products some of which displace non-laser technologies. Our annual revenue growth rates have varied. Net sales increased by 40%, 12% and 17% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by our customers, particularly by manufacturers using our products for materials processing, which includes general manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, heavy industry, consumer, semiconductor and electronics. Approximately 94% of our revenues in 2017 were from customers using our products for materials processing. Although applications within materials processing are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by customers for materials processing and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending.
Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers, the shipment, installation and acceptance of products at our customers' facilities, the mix of OEM orders and one-time orders for products with large purchase prices, economic and political conditions in a certain country or region and seasonal factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity throughout the year in the regions where we operate. Historically, our net sales have been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. Furthermore, net sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products for use in new applications in the end markets that we serve. The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for a period, which may then slow until we penetrate new markets or obtain new customers.

Gross margin. Our total gross margin in any period can be significantly affected by total net sales in any period, by product mix, that is, the percentage of our revenue in the period that is attributable to higher or lower power products and the mix of sales between laser and amplifier sources and complete systems, by sales mix between OEM customers who purchase devices from us in high unit volumes and other customers, by mix of sales in different geographies and by other factors, some of which are not under our control.
Our product mix affects our margins because the selling price per watt is generally higher for medium power devices and certain specialty products than for high power devices and certain pulsed lasers sold in large volumes. The overall cost of high power lasers may be partially offset by improved absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with sales of larger volumes of higher power products because they use a greater number of optical components and drive economies of scale in manufacturing. Also, the profit margins on systems can be lower than margins for our laser and amplifier sources, depending on the configuration, volume and competitive forces, among other factors.
We believe our strategy to maintain and extend our leadership position will result in industry-leading revenue growth and profitability. Although our fiber laser technology has a leading market position within select materials processing applications, our share within many other laser applications is significantly smaller and non-existent in many other applications. We estimate fiber lasers comprise less than 35% of total laser source sales and that laser-based machine tools comprise less than 25% of all machine tools used for cutting and welding of metals. Given the potential for our fiber laser technology to gain deeper penetration within the broader markets we serve and plan to target, we continue to introduce new technologies and products to expand our market presence. We expect that some new technologies and products will have returns above our cost of capital but may have gross margins below our corporate average. If we are able to develop opportunities that are significant in size, competitively advantageous or leverage our existing technology base and leadership, our current gross margin levels may not be maintained. Instead, we aim to deliver industry-leading levels of gross and operating margins by growing our market position across the broader markets we serve.
The mix of sales between OEM customers and other customers can affect gross margin because we provide sales price discounts on products based on the number of units ordered. As the number of OEM customers increase and the number of units ordered increases, the average sales price per unit will be reduced. We expect that the impact of reduced sales price per unit will be offset by the manufacturing efficiency provided by high unit volume orders, but the timing and extent of achieving these efficiencies may not always match the mix of sales in any given time period or be realized at all.
We invested $126.5 million, $127.0 million and $70.1 million in capital expenditures in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Most of this investment relates to expansion of our manufacturing capacity and, to a lesser extent, research and development and sales-related facilities.
A high proportion of our costs is fixed so costs are generally difficult or may take time to adjust in response to changes in demand. In addition, our fixed costs increase as we expand our capacity. If we expand capacity faster than is required by sales growth, gross margins could be negatively affected. Gross margins generally decline if production volumes are lower as a result of a decrease in sales or a reduction in inventory because the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs will be reduced. Gross margins generally improve when the opposite occurs. If both sales and inventory decrease in the same period, the decline in gross margin may be greater if we cannot reduce fixed costs or choose not to reduce fixed costs to match the decrease in the level of production. If we experience a decline in sales that reduces absorption of our fixed costs, or if we have production issues, our gross margins will be negatively affected.
We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or are determined to be excess. Any provision for such slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded provisions for slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory totaling $16.9 million, $22.8 million and $15.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Sales and marketing expense. We expect to continue to expand our worldwide direct sales organization, build and expand applications centers, hire additional sales and marketing personnel at our existing and new geographic locations as well as to support sales of new product lines, increase the number of units for demonstration purposes and otherwise increase expenditures on sales and marketing activities in order to support the growth in our net sales. As such, we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the aggregate.
Research and development expense. We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products, systems and applications technology. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period. In general, if net sales continue to increase we expect research and development expense to increase in the aggregate.

General and administrative expense. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to invest in systems and resources in management, finance, legal, information technology, human resources and administration to support our worldwide operations. Legal expenses vary from quarter to quarter based primarily upon the level of litigation and transaction activities.
Major customers. While we have historically depended on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net sales, the composition of this group can change from year to year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a percentage of our annual net sales were 28%, 22% and 25% in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our largest customer accounted for 13%, 9% and 13% of our net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We seek to add new customers and to expand our relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the composition of our significant customers will continue to change. We generally do not enter into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase our fiber lasers or amplifiers. If any of our significant customers were to substantially reduce their purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. On an ongoing basis we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to inventories, warranty obligations, contingent liabilities, income taxes and the fair value of certain debt and equity instruments including stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, which may materially affect our operating results and financial position. The accounting policies described below are those which, in our opinion, involve the most significant application of judgment, or involve complex estimation, and which could, if different judgments or estimates were made, materially affect our reported results of operations and financial position.
Revenue Recognition.    We recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605. Revenue from orders with multiple deliverables is divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met. These separate units generally consist of equipment and installation. The consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling prices. The selling price of equipment is based on vendor-specific objective evidence and the selling price of installation is based on third-party evidence. Applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied separately for each separate unit of accounting. Revenue for laser and amplifier sources generally is recognized upon the transfer of ownership which is typically at the time of shipment. Installation revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation service which typically occurs within 30 to 90 days of delivery. For laser systems that have customer specific processing requirements, revenue is recognized at the latter of customer acceptance date or shipment date if the customer acceptance is made prior to shipment. Returns and customer credits are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Rights of return generally are not included in sales arrangements.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts.    Accounts receivable include $46.1 million and $24.0 million of bank acceptance drafts issued in China at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Bank acceptance drafts are bank guarantees of payment on specified dates. The maturity of these bank acceptance drafts is less than 90 days. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience and the age of outstanding receivables.
Inventory.    Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value. Inventory includes parts and components that may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence. We maintain a reserve for excess or obsolete inventory items. The reserve is based upon a review of inventory materials on hand, which we compare with historic usage, estimated future usage and age. In addition, we review the inventory and compare recorded costs with estimates of current market value. Write-downs are recorded to reduce the carrying value to the net realizable value with respect to any part with costs in excess of current market value. Estimating demand and current market values is inherently difficult, particularly given that we make highly specialized components and products. We determine the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory by making our best estimate considering the current quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for this inventory to support future sales of our products. We often have limited information on which to base our forecasts. If future sales differ from these forecasts, the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory may change and additional inventory provisions may be required. Because of our vertical integration, a significant or sudden decrease in sales could result in a significant change in the estimates of excess or obsolete inventory valuation.

Warranty.    We maintain an accrual for warranty claims for units sold that are subject to warranty. We estimate this accrual considering past claims experience, the number of units still carrying warranty coverage and the average life of the remaining warranty period.
Stock-based compensation.    Stock-based compensation is included in the following financial statement captions as follows:

------------------------------ ----------------------- ------ ---- ------ ---- ------ ------ - - ------

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Cost of sales $ 5,863 $ 6,018 $ 5,316
Sales and marketing 2,041 1,820 1,998
Research and development 5,001 4,905 4,049
General and administrative 10,116 8,991 7,626
Total stock-based compensation 23,021 21,734 18,989
Tax benefit recognized (7,367 ) (6,971 ) (6,141 )
Net stock-based compensation $ 15,654 $ 14,763 $ 12,848

We account for stock-based compensation using the fair value of the awards granted. We estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes model, we value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method and we use a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of market-based performance stock units. We amortize the fair value of stock options and awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which are generally the vesting periods. After adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017, we account for forfeitures as they occur whereas previous to that date, we estimated the effect of forfeitures at the date of issuance. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of stock-based payment awards represent management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.
The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model were as follows:

------------------------ ----------------------- ------------- -------------

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Expected term 3.8-5.0 years 4.4-6.1 years 4.4-6.3 years

Dividend yield 0.25% 0.25% 0.25%
Forfeiture rate —% 2.65%-5.26% 3.47%-5.88%

The weighted-average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model was as follows:

Dividend yield —% —% —%
Weighted-average fair value per share 147.25 88.51 128.42

We offer an employee stock purchase plan covering our U.S. and German employees. The plan allows employees who participate to purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions at a 15% discount to the lower of the stock price on the first day or last day of the six-month purchase period. Payroll deductions may not exceed 10% of the employee's compensation. Compensation expense related to the employee stock purchase plan for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, was approximately $1.0 million, $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively.
Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes.    Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.
We file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and tax returns in numerous international jurisdictions. We must estimate our income tax expense after considering, among other factors, if inter-company transactions have been made

on an arm’s length basis, differing tax rates between jurisdictions, allocation factors, tax credits, nondeductible items and changes in enacted tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. As we continue to expand globally, there is a risk that, due to complexity within and diversity among the various jurisdictions in which we do business, a governmental agency may disagree with the manner in which we have computed our taxes. Additionally, due to the lack of uniformity among all of the foreign and domestic taxing authorities, there may be situations where the tax treatment of an item in one jurisdiction is different from the tax treatment in another jurisdiction or that the transaction causes a tax liability to arise in another jurisdiction.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; and (4) bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property. Our accounting for the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax ("Transition Tax") element of the Tax Act is incomplete. However, we were able to make estimates of certain effects and, therefore, recorded provisional adjustments. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, we recorded a $47.0 million accrual for the federal Transition Tax and an associated $1.1 million state tax liability with a corresponding adjustment to current income tax expense. The federal Transition Tax is payable over eight years. We also recorded a $1.3 million reduction of net deferred tax assets as a result of the lower enacted tax rate in the Tax Act with a corresponding adjustment to deferred income tax expense.
While our annual tax rate is dependent on the factors detailed above, we expect that the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate rate will reduce our consolidated effective tax rate by approximately four percentage points in 2018 as compared to what the effective tax rate would have been without the enacted tax rate reduction.
 We have provided a $2.2 million deferred tax liability for certain withholding and dividend taxes related to possible distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries to their non-U.S. parents. With regard to repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries back to the U.S., we previously considered these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, recorded no deferred income taxes. We are currently analyzing our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation. We have yet to determine whether we will change our prior assertion and repatriate earnings. Accordingly, we have not recorded any deferred taxes attributable to repatriation to the U.S. of our investments in its foreign subsidiaries. We will record the tax effects of any change in our prior assertion in the period that we complete our analysis and are able to make a reasonable estimate.
Deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as "temporary differences." The tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2017, we had a net deferred tax asset of $5.6 million. If insufficient evidence of our ability to generate future taxable income arises, we may be required to record a valuation allowance against these assets, which will result in additional income tax expense. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate whether the deferred tax assets may be realized in the future and assess the need for a valuation allowance.
We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. Reserves recorded are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is "more likely than not" to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2017, we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $10.4 million that, if recognized, would be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense.
At December 31, 2017, we had $191.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $206.3 million in short-term investments in the United States and $718.2 million of cash and cash equivalents at foreign locations. Cash and cash equivalents outside of the United States are intended to fund working capital, capital expenditures and business expansion outside the United States.

• The increase in high power laser sales related to growth in cutting and welding. High power lasers continue to displace CO2 lasers. We believe our revenue growth has benefited from an accelerated replacement cycle for older CO2 based cutting systems and also from displacement of non-laser technologies, which has resulted in higher demand for the fiber based cutting and welding systems sold by our OEM customers. Within cutting applications, we continue to see a migration to lasers with higher output powers which improve processing speeds and enable processing of thicker materials. The shift towards lasers with higher output powers has also benefited sales due to their higher average selling prices.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Medium power sales increased due to growth in laser sintering and fine welding applications, which was partially offset by decreases in sales for fine cutting applications because fine cutting systems using medium power lasers migrated to using high power 1 to 2 kilowatt lasers. Average selling prices for medium power lasers also declined.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Pulsed laser sales increased due to growth in marking and engraving, cleaning and stripping, solar cell manufacturing and cutting applications. Within the pulsed laser category, the rate of sales increases was larger for high power pulsed lasers than for pulsed lasers with lower average power.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• QCW laser sales increased due to the demand for welding and drilling applications. Welding applications for QCW lasers are primarily related to consumer electronics.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Materials processing sales also increased as a result of improved laser systems and parts and service sales, which are included in Other Revenue in the Sales by Product chart above. The increase in laser systems sales was mainly driven by the July 2017 acquisition of Innovative Laser Technologies, LLC ("ILT").

Sales for other applications increased due to higher sales for telecom and advanced applications. Telecom sales benefited from an increase in sales of pluggable transceivers used in data transmission and an increase in amplifier sales used for last mile fiber access to the home applications. For 2017, the rate of growth of telecom sales benefited from the contribution of sales by Menara, which we acquired in May 2016. Sales of telecom products are included in Other Revenue in the Sales by Product chart above. Advanced application sales are typically uneven from quarter to quarter. The increase in advanced applications sales was driven by increase in demand from defense, semiconductor and scientific applications across various product lines.
Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales increased by $158.0 million, or 34.8%, to $612.0 million in 2017 from $453.9 million in 2016. Our gross margin increased to 56.6% in 2017 from 54.9% in 2016. Gross margin increased due to a decrease in the cost of internally manufactured components, increased manufacturing efficiency and product mix which included increased sales of high power, QCW and pulsed lasers with higher average powers. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by lower average selling prices. Expenses related to provisions for excess or obsolete inventory and other valuation adjustments decreased by $5.9 million to $16.9 million, or 1.2% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $22.8 million, or 2.3% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $11.4 million, or 29.7%, to $49.8 million in 2017 from $38.4 million in 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, trade show and exhibitions, travel and

depreciation expense. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense decreased to 3.5% in 2017 from 3.8% in 2016. As we continue to expand our worldwide sales organization, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the aggregate.
Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $22.3 million, or 28.4%, to $100.9 million in 2017 from $78.6 million in 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, contractors, consultants, materials, depreciation and other research and development expense. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes and developing manufacturing of new components such as crystals and refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields and productivity. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as UV, visible and mid-IR, lasers with ultrafast pulses, laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding and cutting heads. In addition to new products research and development is focused on enhancing the performance of our existing products by improving their electrical efficiency and increasing their average power. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense decreased to 7.2% in 2017 from 7.8% in 2016. We expect to continue to invest in research and development and that research and development expense will increase in the aggregate.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $14.2 million, or 21.3%, to $80.7 million in 2017 from $66.5 million in 2016, primarily as a result of increased expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation, accounting, subscription fees, recruitment, information technology, travel and depreciation expense. In 2016, general and administrative expense also includes a non-cash impairment charge of $2.9 million related to our corporate aircraft. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense decreased to 5.7% in 2017 from 6.6% in 2016. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we invest to support the expected growth in net sales.
Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating expenses. We estimate that if exchange rates had been the same as one year ago, sales in 2017 would have been $2.0 million higher, gross margin would have been $4.3 million higher and operating expenses in total would have been $3.7 million lower. These estimates assume constant exchange rates between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016 and are calculated using the average exchange rates for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 for the respective currencies, which were US$1=Euro 0.90, US$1=Japanese Yen 109, US$1=Chinese Yuan 6.65 and US$1=Russian Ruble 67.
Loss (gain) on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange loss of $14.5 million in 2017 as compared to a loss of $4.5 million in 2016. The change was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Euro and Russian Ruble as compared to the U.S. Dollar, which was partially offset by appreciation of the Chinese Yuan as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
Interest income (expense), net. Interest income (expense), net decreased to $0.7 million of income in 2017 compared to $1.3 million of income in 2016.
Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net decreased to approximately $0 in 2017 compared to $0.9 million of income in 2016 as a result of the loss incurred upon sale of available-for-sale-securities being partially offset by increases in net rental income from a building in the United States purchased in the second quarter of 2016 that is partially leased to third parties.
Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $204.3 million in 2017 compared to $105.8 million in 2016, representing an effective tax rate of 37.0% in 2017 and 28.9% in 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the amounts recorded upon adoption of the Tax Act including $47.0 million of accrued federal Transition Taxes for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries with an associated $1.1 million state tax liability and a $1.3 million write down of deferred tax assets as a result of the rate reductions in the Tax Act. In addition, the provision for income taxes includes a $4.4 million provision for uncertain tax positions. These increases in the provision for income taxes were partially offset by $14.6 million of excess tax benefits related to exercise of stock options and release of restricted stock units which vested during the period. Effective as of the beginning of 2017, the accounting standard related to excess tax benefits and deficits changed, and these items are now recognized in the provision for income taxes whereas previously they were accounted for within additional paid-in capital. The tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation will increase or decrease our effective rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the benefits taken on our tax return which will depend upon the quantity and intrinsic value of RSUs that vest and options that are exercised in the period. Additionally, we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and we anticipate that our effective rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the factors described above.
Net income. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation increased by $86.8 million to $347.6 million in 2017 from $260.8 million in 2016. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales decreased by 1.2% to 24.7% in 2017 from 25.9% in 2016 due to the factors described above.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The increase in high power laser sales related to growth in cutting, cladding, laser sintering, heat treatment and annealing applications partially offset by a decline in surface patterning and automotive related welding applications and decreases in average selling prices. High power lasers are continuing to displace CO2 lasers in cutting systems sold by our OEM customers. We are also seeing increased use of high power lasers for deposition applications like cladding and laser sintering which is used in additive manufacturing. Our cutting and additive manufacturing OEM customers are producing systems using lasers with higher output powers in order to improve the speed with which parts are cut and grown.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The decrease in medium power sales related to fine cutting applications partially offset by a higher demand for medium power lasers used for fine welding, sintering and ablation applications. In part the increase in sintering applications transitioned to high power lasers because our additive manufacturing OEM customers are increasingly using high power lasers instead of medium power lasers in their systems. While the number of units shipped of medium power lasers increased, this increase was offset by declines in average selling prices.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Low power laser sales decreased due to lower sales for medical applications.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Pulsed laser sales increased due to higher demand for ablation and cleaning and stripping applications. Marking and engraving applications, which is the largest application for pulsed lasers, was relatively flat. Within the pulsed laser category, increased sales of high power pulsed lasers and green pulsed lasers were partially offset by decreased sales of pulsed lasers with lower average power.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• QCW laser sales decreased due to lower demand for fine cutting from consumer electronics applications partially offset by increased sales for welding and drilling applications.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Materials processing sales also increased as a result of higher sales and service related sales which are included in above.

Sales for other applications increased due to higher sales for telecom applications. The increase in telecom sales was driven by sales from Menara, which we acquired in May 2016, and an increase in amplifier sales used for last mile fiber access

to the home applications. Sales of telecom products are included in Other Revenue. These sales increases were partially offset by a decrease in medical application sales.
Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales increased by $44.5 million, or 10.9%, to $453.9 million in 2016 from $409.4 million in 2015. Our gross margin increased to 54.9% in 2016 from 54.6% in 2015. Gross margin increased due to decreases in the cost of internally manufactured components and increased manufacturing efficiency which have offset decreases in average selling prices. Gross margin also benefited from product mix including increased sales of CW high power lasers with output power of more than 6 kilowatts, high power pulsed lasers and higher power QCW lasers. These benefits were partially offset by a decrease in absorption of manufacturing costs, increased provision for inventory reserves, an increase in expenses related to the amortization of intangibles and the step-up to fair value of inventory acquired in the Menara transaction. Expenses related to provisions for excess or obsolete inventory and other valuation adjustments increased by $7.4 million to $22.8 million, or 2.3% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $15.4 million, or 1.7% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $6.6 million, or 20.5%, to $38.4 million in 2016 from $31.9 million in 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, premises and trade show and exhibitions expense. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 3.8% in 2016 from 3.5% in 2015.
Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $15.2 million, or 24.0%, to $78.6 million in 2016 from $63.3 million in 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, stock-based compensation, materials, depreciation and other research and development expense. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes and developing manufacturing of new components such as crystals and refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields and productivity. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as UV, visible and mid-IR, lasers with ultrafast pulses, laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding and cutting heads. In addition to new products research and development is focused on enhancing the performance of our existing products by improving their electrical efficiency and increasing their average power. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 7.8% in 2016 from 7.0% in 2015.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $9.3 million, or 16.3%, to $66.5 million in 2016 from $57.2 million in 2015, primarily as a result of increased expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation, legal, consulting, information technology and travel. It also includes a non-cash impairment charge of $2.9 million related to our corporate aircraft. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 6.6% in 2016 from 6.3% in 2015.
Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating expenses. We estimate that if exchange rates had been the same as one year ago, sales in 2016 would have been $16.1 million higher, gross margin would have been $8.6 million higher and operating expenses in total would have been $2.2 million higher. These estimates assume constant exchange rates between fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015 and are calculated using the average exchange rates for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2015 for the respective currencies, which were US$1=Euro 0.90, US$1=Japanese Yen 121, US$1=Chinese Yuan 6.24 and US$1=Russian Ruble 61.
Loss (gain) on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange loss of $4.5 million in 2016 as compared to a gain of -$2.6 million in 2015. The change was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Russian Ruble and depreciation of the Chinese Yuan as compared to the U.S. Dollar partially offset by the depreciation of the Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
Interest income (expense), net. Interest income (expense), net increased to $1.3 million of income in 2016 compared to $0.3 million of expense in 2015 as a result of higher yielding interest and increases in short-term investments.
Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net increased to $0.9 million of income in 2016 compared to $0.1 million of expense in 2015 as a result of increased rental income from current occupied spaces in a recently acquired building.
Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $105.8 million in 2016 compared to $99.6 million in 2015, representing an effective tax rate of 28.9% in 2016 and 29.2% in 2015. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily the result of increased income before provision for income taxes. The decrease in effective rate was due to the release of income tax reserves upon the completion of a tax audit, the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions, and an increase in the benefit related to research and development tax credits. The legislation enabling research and development credits in the United States was permanently enacted at the end of 2015. The effective rate decrease was partially offset by a $1.6 million deferred tax liability for certain withholding and dividend taxes related to possible distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries to their non-U.S. parents in 2016.

Net income. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation increased by $18.6 million to $260.8 million in 2016 from $242.2 million in 2015. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales decreased by 1.0% to 25.9% in 2016 from 26.9% in 2015 due to the factors described above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity as of December 31, 2017 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $909.9 million, short-term investments of $206.3 million, unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of $111.0 million and working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) of $439.0 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $623.9 million, short-term investments of $206.8 million, unused credit lines and overdraft facilities of $71.5 million and working capital (excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) of $312.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $285.5 million from $830.7 million to $1,116.2 million relates primarily to cash provided by operating activities in 2017 of $405.4 million, which was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of $170.8 million and cash used in financing activities of $3.4 million.
Short-term investments consist of liquid investments including U.S. government and government agency notes, corporate notes, commercial paper and certificates of deposit with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year.
Our long-term debt consists of two long-term notes with a combined total outstanding balance at December 31, 2017 of $49.0 million of which $3.6 million is the current portion. We have an unsecured note with an outstanding balance at December 31, 2017 of $22.0 million of which $1.2 million is the current portion. The interest on this unsecured note is variable at 1.20% above LIBOR and is fixed using an interest rate swap at 2.85% per annum. The unsecured note matures in May 2023, at which time the outstanding debt balance will be $15.4 million. We have another note that is secured by our corporate aircraft. The outstanding balance on this secured note at December 31, 2017 was $27.0 million of which $2.4 million is the current portion. The interest rate on this secured note is fixed at 2.74% per annum and it matures in July 2022, at which time the outstanding debt balance will be $15.4 million.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit provide us with the financial flexibility to meet our liquidity and capital needs, as well as to complete certain acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities based upon market conditions and the strategic importance and valuation of the target company. We may consider issuing debt to finance acquisitions depending on the timing and size of the acquisition among other reasons. Our future long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors including our level of sales, the impact of economic environment on our sales levels, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of the global sales and marketing activities, government regulation including trade sanctions, the timing and introduction of new products, the need to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products.
The following table details our line-of-credit facilities as of December 31, 2017:

------------------------------------ --------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------- ------------ --------------------------------------------------------------

Our largest committed credit lines are with Bank of America N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG in the amounts of $50.0 million and $59.9 million (or 50 million Euro as described above), respectively, and neither of them is syndicated.
We are required to meet certain financial covenants associated with our U.S. revolving line of credit and long-term debt facilities. These covenants, tested quarterly, include a debt service coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio. The debt service coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as required principal and interest payments during the period. Debt service in the calculation is decreased by our cash held in the U.S.A. in excess of $50 million up to a maximum of $250 million. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than two times our trailing twelve months EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2017.
The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to not take or to delay investments and actions that we might otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt or a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
Operating activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $107.7 million to $405.4 million in 2017 from $297.7 million in 2016. Our business has experienced a compounded annual growth rate over the past three years of 22% in net sales and of 20% in net income. In 2017, net sales and net income grew by 40% and 33%, respectively. As the business and net income has grown, cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges has increased. This increase has been partially offset by continued increases in working capital to support the growth of the business. Our largest working capital items are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory because of the amount of value added within IPG due to our vertically integrated structure. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes payable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. The increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2017 primarily resulted from:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase in cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges of $512.0 million in 2017 as compared to $372.5 million in 2016; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase in cash due to an increase in income and other taxes payable of $16.7 million in 2017 compared with a decrease of $10.7 million in 2016; partially offset by

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase in cash used by accounts receivable of $63.2 million in 2017 as compared to $11.4 million in 2016 due to higher sales volume and an increase in days sales outstanding; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase in cash used by inventory of $71.1 million in 2017 as compared to $53.6 million in 2016 due to an increase in inventory to support the sales growth and an increase in days inventory on hand.

Given our vertical integration, rigorous and time-consuming testing procedures for both internally manufactured and externally purchased components and the lead time required to manufacture components used in our finished products, the rate at which we turn inventory has historically been comparatively low when compared to our cost of sales. Also, our historic growth rates required investment in inventories to support future sales and enable us to quote short delivery times to our customers, providing what we believe is a competitive advantage. Furthermore, if there was a disruption to the manufacturing capacity of any of our key technologies, our inventories of components should enable us to continue to build finished products for a reasonable period of time. We believe that we will continue to maintain a relatively high level of inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result, we expect to have a significant amount of working capital invested in inventory. A reduction in our level of net sales or the rate of growth of our net sales from their current levels would mean that the rate at which we are able to convert our inventory into cash would decrease.
We assess our intention and ability to reinvest the earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations. The Tax Act estimated charges include $47.0 million related to the one-time Transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings which is payable over eight years. The provisions of the Tax Act allow for tax free repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. We have recorded a deferred tax liability of $1.1 million for the state tax effect of future repatriation. In addition, we have a $2.2 million deferred tax liability for certain withholding and dividend taxes related to possible distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries to their non-U.S. parents. With regard to repatriation of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries back to the U.S., we are currently analyzing our global working capital and cash requirements and the potential additional tax liabilities attributable to a repatriation. We have yet to determine whether we will repatriate earnings. Accordingly, we have not recorded any deferred taxes attributable to repatriation to the U.S. of our investments in its foreign subsidiaries.

Investing activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $170.8 million and $274.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in 2017 related to $126.5 million for property, plant and equipment including the purchase of a new corporate aircraft and $60.5 million for the acquisition of three businesses during 2017, net of cash acquired. These cash uses were partially offset by $15.9 million of cash generated by the sale of fixed assets, primarily the previous corporate aircraft. The cash used in investing activities in 2016 related to $127.0 million for property, plant and equipment, $100.7 million of net purchases of short-term investments and $47.8 million for the acquisition of two businesses, net of cash acquired.
In 2018, we expect to incur approximately $170 million to $190 million in capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. Capital expenditures include investments in property, facilities and equipment to add capacity worldwide to support anticipated revenue growth. The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. If we obtain financing for certain projects, our cash expenditures would be reduced in the year of expenditure. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period.
Financing activities.    Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities was $(3.4) million and $27.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The cash used in financing activities in 2017 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $40.0 million and payments on our long-term borrowings of $19.8 million, the majority of which related to repayment of the long-term note secured by our previous corporate aircraft. These cash uses were partially offset by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan and proceeds of debt issued to fund the new corporate aircraft purchase. The cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was primarily related to the cash provided by the proceeds on long-term borrowings, the exercise of stock options, issuances under our employee stock purchase plan, the related tax benefits of the exercises, partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock and noncontrolling interest as well as payments on our long-term debt.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.
