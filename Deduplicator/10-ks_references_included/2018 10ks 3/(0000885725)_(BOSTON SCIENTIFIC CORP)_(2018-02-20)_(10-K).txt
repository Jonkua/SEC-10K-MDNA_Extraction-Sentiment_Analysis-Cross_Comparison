ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Boston Scientific Corporation and its subsidiaries. For a full understanding of our financial condition and results of operations, this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Executive Summary
Financial Highlights and Trends

In 2017, we generated net sales of $9.048 billion, as compared to $8.386 billion in 2016, an increase of $662 million, or 7.9 percent. Our operational net sales, which exclude a 10 basis point impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased $661 million, or 7.8 percent, as compared to the prior year.1 This increase included operational net sales of approximately $105 million in 2017 due to the acquisition of EndoChoice Holdings, Inc. (EndoChoice) during the fourth quarter of 2016 and the acquisition of Symetis SA (Symetis) during the second quarter of 2017. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our net sales by global business.
Our reported net income in 2017 was $104 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. Our reported results for 2017 included certain charges and/or credits totaling $1.647 billion (after-tax), or $1.18 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2017 was $1.752 billion, or $1.26 per share.1 Our reported net income in 2016 was $347 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Our reported results for 2016 included certain charges and/or credits totaling $1.187 billion (after-tax), or $0.86 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2016 was $1.534 billion, or $1.11 per share.1

1 Operational net sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, which exclude certain items required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP), are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Refer to Additional Information for a discussion of management’s use of these non-GAAP financial measures.

Business and Market Overview

The following section describes an overview of our product offerings and results of operations by business unit. For additional information on our businesses and their product offerings, see Item 1. Business of this Annual Report.

Cardiovascular

Interventional Cardiology

Our Interventional Cardiology business develops and manufactures technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders including structural heart conditions. Our broad, innovative product offerings have enabled us to become a leader in the global interventional cardiology market.

Our net sales of Interventional Cardiology products of $2.419 billion represented approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017. Our Interventional Cardiology net sales increased $138 million, or 6.1 percent, in 2017, as compared to 2016. Our operational net sales, which exclude an immaterial impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased 6.1 percent as compared to the prior year. This year-over-year increase was primarily related to sales of our WATCHMAN™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology device and growth in our complex percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) product offerings.

On May 16, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Symetis, a privately-held Swiss structural heart company focused on minimally-invasive transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices. We are in the process of integrating Symetis into our Interventional Cardiology business and expect the integration to be substantially complete by the end of 2018.

Peripheral Interventions

Our Peripheral Interventions business develops and manufactures products to diagnose and treat peripheral arterial diseases, including a broad line of medical devices used in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and peripheral vascular diseases, as well as products to diagnose, treat and ease various forms of cancer.

Our net sales of Peripheral Interventions products of $1.081 billion represented approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017. Our Peripheral Interventions net sales increased $69 million or 6.8 percent, in 2017, as compared to 2016. Our operational net sales, which exclude a 20 basis point impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased 6.6 percent, as compared to 2016. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by growth in our core franchises, particularly our stent portfolio, our drug-eluting product franchise and our atherectomy systems.

Rhythm Management

Cardiac Rhythm Management

Our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business develops and manufactures a variety of implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities.

The following are the components of our CRM net sales:

--------------------- ----------------- ----- ----------------- --- - -----

 Year Ended
(in millions) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016
Defibrillator systems $ 1,305 $ 1,274
Pacemaker systems 590 576
CRM products $ 1,895 $ 1,850

Our net sales of CRM products of $1.895 billion represented approximately 21 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017. Our net sales of CRM products increased $45 million, or 2.5 percent, in 2017, as compared to 2016. Our operational net sales, which exclude a 20 basis point impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased 2.3 percent, as compared to 2016. This year-over-year increase was driven by growth in both our defibrillator and pacemaker portfolios. Our defibrillator growth was primarily driven by continued EMBLEM™ S-ICD sales, launch of our RESONATE™ family of ICD and CRT-D’s in Europe and the favorable impact from U.S. MRI safe conditional labeling, which was approved by the FDA in September 2017. Our

 36

pacemaker growth was primarily driven by the annualized impact of our U.S. MRI pacemaker launch in the first half of 2017, partially offset by more difficult U.S. pacemaker comparisons in the second half of 2017.

Electrophysiology

Our Electrophysiology business develops and manufactures less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart, including a broad portfolio of therapeutic and diagnostic catheters and a variety of equipment used in the Electrophysiology lab.

Our net sales of Electrophysiology products of $278 million represented approximately three percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017. Our Electrophysiology net sales increased $35 million, or 14.5 percent, in 2017, as compared to 2016. Our operational net sales, which exclude a 10 basis point impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased 14.4 percent, as compared to 2016. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased sales of our next generation Rhythmia™ Mapping System, Rhythmia HDx™, Rhythmia related disposables and our expanding portfolio of navigation enabled therapeutic catheters.

MedSurg

Endoscopy

Our Endoscopy business develops and manufactures devices to diagnose and treat a broad range of gastrointestinal (GI) and pulmonary conditions with innovative, less invasive technologies.

Our net sales of Endoscopy products of $1.619 billion represented approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017. Our Endoscopy net sales increased $179 million, or 12.4 percent, in 2017, as compared to 2016. Our operational net sales, which exclude a 10 basis point impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased 12.3 percent, as compared to 2016. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by growth across several of our key product franchises, including our hemostasis franchise featuring our Resolution 360™ Clips, our biliary franchise with our SpyGlass™ DS Direct Visualization System and our infection prevention products and pathology services that were acquired as part of the EndoChoice acquisition.

On November 22, 2016, we completed our acquisition of EndoChoice. EndoChoice is an Alpharetta, Georgia based company focused on the development and commercialization of infection prevention products, pathology services and single-use devices for specialists treating a wide range of GI conditions. In 2017, we substantially completed the process of integrating EndoChoice into our Endoscopy business.

Urology and Pelvic Health

Our Urology and Pelvic Health business develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and pelvic conditions for both male and female anatomies, including kidney stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, male incontinence, pelvic floor disorders, abnormal uterine bleeding and uterine fibroids and polyps.

Our net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products of $1.124 billion represented approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017. Urology and Pelvic Health net sales increased $119 million, or 11.8 percent, in 2017, as compared to 2016. Our operational net sales, which exclude a 20 basis point impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased 11.6 percent, as compared to 2016. This year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to growth in sales of our kidney stone products, including our LithoVue™ Digital Flexible Ureteroscope, our pelvic floor products, as a result of market share gains primarily driven by a competitor exiting the market in 2016, and our men's health products.

Neuromodulation

Our Neuromodulation business develops and manufactures devices to treat various neurological movement disorders and manage chronic pain.

Our net sales of Neuromodulation products of $635 million represented seven percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017. Neuromodulation net sales increased $79 million, or 14.2 percent, in 2017, as compared to 2016. Our operational net sales, which exclude a 10 basis point impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased 14.1 percent, as compared to 2016. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by continued adoption of our Precision Montage™ and Precision Spectra™ with MultiWave™ Technology Spinal Cord Simulator Systems in the U.S. and an increase in international sales, including sales of our Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation System.

 37

Emerging Markets

As part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in Item 1. Business of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. We define Emerging Markets as including 20 countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors and our global capabilities. We have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Our Emerging Markets net sales represented 10.1 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017 and 9.5 percent in 2016. In 2017, our Emerging Markets net sales grew 14.7 percent on a reported basis and excluding a 10 basis point impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, grew 14.6 percent on an operational basis, both as compared to the prior year.

Net Sales $ 9,048 $ 8,386 $ 7,477 7.9% 12.1%

Refer to Executive Summary for further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2017 and 2016 net sales.

In 2016, we generated net sales of $8.386 billion, as compared to $7.477 billion in 2015, an increase of $909 million, or 12.1 percent. Our operational net sales, which exclude a 40 basis point impact related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased $1.008 billion, or 12.5 percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increases in net sales from our Urology and Pelvic Health business of $312 million, primarily due to the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, from our Interventional Cardiology business of $248 million, led by sales from our Synergy drug-eluting stent and further penetration of the WATCHMAN™ Device, from our Endoscopy business of $134 million and from our Peripheral Intervention business of $107 million.

Gross Profit
Our gross profit was $6.455 billion in 2017, $5.962 billion in 2016 and $5.304 billion in 2015. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 71.3 percent in 2017, as compared to 71.1 percent in 2016 and 70.9 percent in 2015. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period:

--------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ---- --

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016
Gross profit - prior year 71.1 % 70.9 %
Manufacturing cost reductions 1.9 % 2.0 %
Sales pricing and mix 0.1 % (0.1 )%
Inventory step-up due to acquisition accounting (0.2 )% (0.2 )%
Net impact of foreign currency (1.3 )% (0.9 )%
All other, including other inventory charges and other period expense (0.3 )% (0.6 )%
Gross profit - current year 71.3 % 71.1 %

The primary factor contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin for 2017 and 2016 as compared to the prior year periods was the positive impacts of cost reductions as a result of our process improvement programs and restructuring programs. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and other inventory charges and period

 39

expenses. In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded charges related to the voluntary removal of Lotus Valve Devices from global, commercial and clinical sites.

Operating Expenses
The following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses:

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------- -------- ---- - -------- ----- - -------- - ----- ---- -

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
 % of Net % of Net % of Net
(in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ Sales
Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,294 36.4 % 3,099 37.0 % 2,873 38.4 %
Research and development expenses 997 11.0 % 920 11.0 % 876 11.7 %
Royalty expense 68 0.8 % 79 0.9 % 70 0.9 %

Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses

In 2017, our SG&A expenses increased $195 million, or six percent, as compared to 2016 and were 60 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by increased net sales, as well as the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A. In 2016, our SG&A expenses increased $226 million, or eight percent, as compared to 2015 and were 140 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, as well as the reduction in expenses resulting from the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax, which was substantially reinvested into our strategic growth initiatives. The Medical Device Excise Tax was temporarily suspended in December 2015 through December 31, 2017. In January 2018 another temporary two year suspension of the 2.3 percent excise tax was passed, extending the suspension to December 31, 2019.

Research and Development (R&D) Expenses

We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. In 2017, our R&D expenses increased $77 million, or eight percent, as compared to 2016, yet remained flat as a percentage of net sales at approximately 11.0 percent. In 2016, our R&D expenses increased $44 million, or five percent, as compared to 2015 and were 70 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The year-over-year increase in expenses was due primarily to investments across our businesses in order to maintain a pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.

Royalty Expense

In 2017, our royalty expense decreased $11 million, or 14 percent, as compared to 2016. Our royalty expense remained relatively flat at approximately one percent of net sales for both periods. The decrease in royalty expense relates primarily to a renegotiated lower royalty rate structure on certain products.

In 2016, our royalty expense increased $9 million, or 13 percent, as compared to 2015 and remained relatively flat at approximately one percent of net sales for both periods. The increase in royalty expense was primarily due to increases in net sales of our drug-eluting stent systems in 2016.

Amortization Expense

Our amortization expense was $565 million in 2017, as compared to $545 million in 2016, an increase of $20 million or four percent. Amortization expense was $545 million in 2016, as compared to $495 million in 2015, an increase of $50 million or 10 percent. The increases in each period were primarily due to amortizable intangible assets acquired as part of our recent acquisitions including the Symetis acquisition in 2017, the EndoChoice acquisition in 2016 and the AMS Portfolio Acquisition in 2015. Amortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.

 40

Intangible Asset Impairment Charges

In 2017, 2016 and 2015 we recorded immaterial intangible asset impairment charges, including impairments of in-process research and development in 2016 and 2015. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Intangible asset impairment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.

Contingent Consideration Expense

We recorded a net benefit related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $80 million in 2017, a net expense of $29 million in 2016 and a net expense of $123 million in 2015. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details related to our contingent consideration arrangements. Contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.

Restructuring-related Activities and Charges

The following table provides a summary of our restructuring and restructuring-related charges and cash payments:

----------------------------------- ----------------------- -- ---- ---- -- - --

 Year Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2017 2016 2015
Total restructuring charges $ 37 $ 28 $ 26
Total restructuring-related charges $ 58 $ 50 $ 57

Total cash payments $ 70 $ 82 $ 95

Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.

The 2016 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $275 million to $325 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $165 million to $175 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized. The 2014 Restructuring Plan resulted in total pre-tax charges of $261 million and is expected to continually reduce annual expenses by approximately $200 million. A substantial portion of these savings are being reinvested in strategic growth initiatives.

See Note G – Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our restructuring plans.

Litigation-related Charges and Credits

We recorded litigation-related net charges in the amount of $285 million in 2017, $804 million in 2016 and $1.105 billion in 2015. The net charges recorded in 2017 and 2016 include amounts primarily related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims. The net charges recorded in 2015 include amounts primarily related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and the charge related to the Mirowski Family Venture LLC (Mirowski) lawsuit following a jury verdict that Guidant Corporation (Guidant) breached their license agreement with Mirowski. Litigation related charges and credits are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.

We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. Refer to Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of our material legal proceedings.

 $ (124 ) $ (37 ) $ (83 )

In 2017, we recorded total charges of $56 million for an other-than-temporary impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of one of our investments and their fair value. Certain impairment charges that are considered to be unusual or infrequent and significant are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our strategic investments.

We recorded pension termination charges of $44 million during 2015 associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. In accordance with the adoption of ASC Update No. 2017-07, this charge was retrospectively reclassified from Operating expenses to Other, net on our consolidated statements of operations. Please refer to Note A – Significant Accounting Policies and Note P - New Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for additional information. We do not expect to incur any additional charges in the future related to the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan. Pension termination charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.
Tax Rate
The following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate:

----------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ----- -- ----- --

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Reported tax rate 88.8 % (95.9 )% 63.2 %
Impact of certain receipts/charges* (75.8 )% 108.3 % (53.5 )%
 13.0 % 12.4 % 9.7 %

*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.

 42

The change in our reported tax rate for 2017, as compared to 2016 and 2015, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate, including intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, restructuring and restructuring-related items, litigation-related items and certain investment impairments, as well as the impact of certain discrete tax items. Included in the discrete tax items during the year was the impact of the TCJA, enacted December 22, 2017 in the U.S.

In 2017, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, restructuring and restructuring-related items, litigation-related items and certain investment impairments. Our reported tax rate for 2017 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to the TCJA.

In 2016, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, restructuring and restructuring-related items and litigation-related items. Our reported tax rate for 2016 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions through settlement or expiration of statute, offset by a charge related to changes in state apportionment.

In 2015, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, restructuring and restructuring-related items, litigation-related items, debt extinguishment charges and pension termination charges. Our reported tax rate for 2015 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to benefits due to settlement of various uncertain tax positions and reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied.

We are contesting in U.S. Tax Court significant proposed adjustments from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to its audit of our transfer pricing methodologies for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. The IRS also proposed similar transfer pricing adjustments for the 2008 through 2010 tax years. We disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the IRS and we were scheduled to go to trial in the U.S. Tax Court in late July 2016. On July 19, 2016, we entered a Stipulation of Settled Issues with the IRS intended to resolve all of the aforementioned transfer pricing issues, as well as issues related to our transaction with Abbott Laboratories, for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. The Stipulation of Settled Issues is contingent upon the IRS Office of Appeals applying the same basis of settlement to all transfer pricing issues for the Company’s 2008, 2009 and 2010 tax years as well as review by the United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation. In October 2016, we reached an agreement in principle with IRS Office of Appeals as to the resolution of the transfer pricing issues in 2008, 2009 and 2010 tax years, subject to additional calculations of tax as well as documentation to memorialize our agreement.

In the event that the conditions in the Stipulation of Settled Items are satisfied, we expect to make net tax payments of approximately $275 million, plus interest through the date of payment with respect to the settled issues. If finalized, payments related to the resolution are expected in the next six months. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of December 31, 2017 and we do not expect to recognize any additional charges related to resolution of this controversy. However, the final resolution of these issues is contingent and if the Stipulation of Settled Issues is not finalized, it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
See Note I - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our tax rate and our tax litigation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Based on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt. Please refer to our Contractual Obligations and Commitments table for additional details on our future payment obligations and commitments.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $188 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $21 million invested in money market and government funds and $167 million in interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.250 billion commercial paper program, which is backed by our 2017 revolving credit facility described below. As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.197 billion in commercial paper debt outstanding resulting in an additional $1.053 billion of available liquidity and $400 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables as of December 31, 2017, both described below.

The following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows):

------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ----- ---- - ------ - - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2017 2016 2015
Cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ 1,426 $ 1,182 $ 691
Cash provided by (used for) investing activities (1,010 ) (887 ) (2,186 )
Cash provided by (used for) financing activities 110 (206 ) 1,276

Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies and reducing our debt levels.
Operating Activities
During 2017, we generated $1.426 billion of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.182 billion in 2016, an increase of $244 million or 21 percent. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating profit for 2017 compared to 2016.
During 2016, we generated $1.182 billion of cash from operating activities, as compared to $691 million in 2015, an increase of $491 million, or 71 percent. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating profit for 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by approximately $100 million increase in litigation-related payments, primarily associated with the transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and to Mirowski.
Investing Activities
During 2017, cash used for investing activities was $1.010 billion. Our investing activities primarily include $560 million of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions including Symetis and Apama, $319 million of payments for purchases of property, plant and equipment, including amounts to complete our manufacturing plant in Malaysia and $131 million of payments related to strategic investments.
During 2016, cash used for investing activities was $887 million. Our investing activities primarily included $408 million of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions including EndoChoice, $376 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment and $132 million of payments related to strategic investments, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of one of two buildings located in Quincy, Massachusetts for $29 million.
During 2015, cash used for investing activities was $2.186 billion. Our investing activities included $1.734 billion of payments net of cash acquired, for acquisitions, primarily related to the AMS Portfolio Acquisition and CeloNova, along with $266 million of payments related to strategic investments. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $247 million.
Financing Activities
Our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, including our new commercial paper program and cash used to new share settle and stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, as discussed in Note K - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, our financing activities included $33 million of contingent payments in 2017, $65 million of payments in 2016 and $156 million of payments in 2015 associated with our previous acquisitions.
Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risk and uncertainties could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans.

 Note: The table above does not include unamortized amounts related to interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges.

Revolving Credit Facility

On August 4, 2017, we entered into a $2.250 billion revolving credit facility (the 2017 Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks and terminated our previous $2.000 billion revolving credit facility (the 2015 Facility), which was scheduled to mature in April 2020. The 2017 Facility will mature on August 4, 2022. Eurodollar and multicurrency loans under the 2017 Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin of between 0.90 percent and 1.50 percent, based on our corporate credit ratings (1.10 percent as of December 31, 2017). Under the credit agreement for the 2017 Facility (the 2017 Credit Agreement), we are required to pay a facility fee (0.15 percent as of December 31, 2017) based on our credit ratings and the total amount of revolving credit commitment, regardless of usage of the 2017 Facility. This facility provides backing for the commercial paper program described below. There were no amounts borrowed under our current or prior revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.

The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows:

-------------------------- ------------------------------------------- -----------------------------

 CovenantRequirement as of December 31, 2017 Actual as ofDecember 31, 2017
Maximum leverage ratio (1) 3.5 times 2.2 times

(1) Ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit agreement, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.

The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, through maturity, of any non-cash charges and up to $500 million in restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses related to our current or future restructuring plans. As of December 31, 2017, we had $444 million of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the 2017 Credit Agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments do not exceed $2.624 billion in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.839 billion of the legal exclusion remaining.

 45

Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers on terms acceptable to us.  In this case, all credit facility commitments would terminate and any amounts borrowed under the facility would become immediately due and payable.  Furthermore, any termination of our credit facility may negatively impact the credit ratings assigned to our commercial paper program which may impact our ability to refinance any then outstanding commercial paper as it becomes due and payable.

Commercial Paper

In June 2017, we launched a commercial paper program that allowed the Company to have a maximum of $2.000 billion in commercial paper outstanding. In August 2017, we increased our commercial paper program’s maximum to $2.250 billion, in line with the increased size of the 2017 Facility. Outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity available under the 2017 Facility. As of December 31, 2017 there was $1.197 billion of commercial paper outstanding. The commercial paper program is backed by the 2017 Facility. Commercial paper issued as of December 31, 2017 had a weighted average maturity of 38 days and a weighted average yield of 1.85 percent.

Term Loans

As of December 31, 2016, we had $750 million outstanding under our unsecured term loan facilities. These facilities included an unsecured term loan for $150 million maturing August 2018 (2018 Term Loan) and an unsecured term loan facility for $600 million maturing August 2020 (2020 Term Loan). Both of these term loan facilities were fully repaid in 2017.

Senior Notes

We had senior notes outstanding of $4.400 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $4.650 billion as of December 31, 2016. On January 12, 2017, we used our existing credit facilities to repay the $250 million plus interest of our senior notes due in January 2017.

Our senior notes were issued in public offerings, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility, to the extent if borrowed by our subsidiaries and to liabilities of our subsidiaries (see Other Arrangements below).

Our $4.050 billion of senior notes issued in 2009, 2013 and 2015 contain a change-in-control provision, which provides that each holder of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate repurchased principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if a rating event, as defined in the indenture, occurs as a result of a change-in-control, as defined in the indenture. Any other credit rating changes may impact our borrowing cost, but do not require us to repay any borrowings.

The interest rate payable on our November 2035 Notes is currently 7.00 percent. Corporate credit rating improvements may result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate on our November 2035 Notes to the extent that our lowest credit rating is above BBB- or Baa3. The interest rates on our November 2035 Notes will be permanently reinstated to the issuance rate if the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either A- or A3 or higher.

Other Arrangements

As of December 31, 2016, we maintained a $300 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables maturing on June 9, 2017. In February 2017, we amended the terms of this credit and security facility, including increasing the facility size to $400 million and extending the facility maturity date to February 2019. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2017 and $60 million outstanding under our credit and security facility as of December 31, 2016. The credit and security facilities requires that we maintain a maximum leverage covenant consistent with our revolving credit facility.

We have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $456 million as of December 31, 2017. We have no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized $171 million of receivables as of December 31, 2017 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent and $152 million as of December 31, 2016 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent.

 46

In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 22.000 billion Japanese yen (approximately $195 million as of December 31, 2017). We de-recognized $157 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2017 at an average interest rate of 1.3 percent and $149 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2016 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent. De-recognized accounts and notes receivable are excluded from trade accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We had outstanding letters of credit of $49 million as of December 31, 2017 and $44 million as of December 31, 2016, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees, accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.
For additional details related to our debt, including our revolving credit facility, term loans, senior notes and other arrangements, see Note E – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

As of and through December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all the required covenants related to our debt obligations.
Equity
During 2017 we received $85 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $111 million in 2016 and $114 million 2015. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.
We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2017, 2016, or 2015. As of December 31, 2017, we had remaining approximately $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. There were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was $127 million in 2017, $116 million in 2016 and $107 million in 2015. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2017:

(2) Includes accrued interest and penalties and other related items.

The amounts in the table above with respect to lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements.

The table above does not reflect our long-term liability for legal matters that are probable and estimable of $436 million due to the timing of payment being uncertain. Refer to Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our legal accrual.
In addition, the table above does not include $835 million of unrecognized tax benefits, accrued interest and penalties and other related items, because the timing of their future cash settlement is uncertain. Refer to Note I - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.

On January 24, 2018, we closed an investment and entered into an acquisition option agreement with Millipede, Inc. (Millipede). Under the terms of the agreements, we have purchased a portion of the outstanding shares of Millipede along with newly issued shares of the company. We also have the option to acquire the remaining shares of Millipede at any time prior to the completion of a first in human clinical study that meets certain parameters. Upon the completion of the clinical study, Millipede has the option to compel us to acquire the remaining shares of the company. Each company’s option period expires by the end of 2019. Completion of this acquisition would result in an additional $325 million payment by us at closing with a further $125 million becoming payable upon achievement of a commercial milestone. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.

On November 1, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with an investee company where we may be obligated to pay $145 million in cash up-front and a maximum of $130 million in contingent payments to acquire the investee. The agreement contains a provision, expiring October 31, 2019, allowing the investee company to sell the remaining equity interests of the investee company to us upon achievement of a regulatory milestone and an option allowing us to acquire the remaining equity interests. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.
With certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining R&D cost to complete acquired in-process research and development projects is between $45 million and $55 million. Net cash inflows from the projects currently in development are expected to commence in 2018 and will continue through 2031, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2017.

Legal Matters
For a discussion of our material legal proceedings see Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management’s judgment: Revenue Recognition, Bad Debt Reserves, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities, Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes.
See Note A – Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. In addition, see Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments and Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration; Note I - Income Taxes for further discussion on income tax related matters and Note J – Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability matters.

 48

Revenue Recognition
We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.

Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE™ Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Generally, we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.
Inventory Provisions
We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.
Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities
We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.
We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (FASB ASC Topic 350). If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.

Goodwill Valuation

We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently

 49

if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. For our 2017, 2016 and 2015 annual impairment assessment, we identified seven reporting units: Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation. Beginning in 2016, we aggregated the Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology reporting units, components of the Rhythm Management operating segment, based on the criteria prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 350. These reporting units were aggregated due to a reorganization that commenced in 2015 that resulted in integrated leadership, shared resources and consolidation of certain sites in 2016.

In performing the goodwill impairment assessment for 2017 and 2016, we utilized both the optional qualitative assessment and the quantitative approach prescribed under FASB ASC Topic 350. Beginning in 2016, the qualitative assessment was used for testing certain reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 percent. All other reporting units were tested using the quantitative approach described below. The qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on an assessment of relevant events including macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other entity-specific factors. After assessing the totality of events, if it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the quantitative approach of the goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. If it is determined that impairment is more likely than not, then we perform the quantitative impairment test. In 2017, we selected our Rhythm Management operating segment and our Neuromodulation reporting unit for quantitative testing, while the remaining reporting units were qualitatively assessed. For all reporting units tested using the optional qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test as it is not more-likely-than-not such reporting units were impaired. For the two reporting units tested using the quantitative approach, we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

For our 2017, 2016 and 2015 annual impairment assessments, for those reporting units for which a quantitative test was performed, we used only the income approach, specifically the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.

In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.

Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.

Future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in procedural volumes, pricing pressures, reductions in reimbursement levels, product actions and/or competitive technology developments,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new and next-generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls,

 50

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• decreases in our forecasted profitability due to an inability to implement successfully and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products,

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the level of success of ongoing and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies, achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations, establishing government and third-party payer reimbursement, supplying the market and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted WACC and increases in our market-participant tax rate and/or changes in tax laws or macroeconomic conditions.

Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.

Refer to Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for additional details related to our annual goodwill balances.
Legal and Product Liability Accruals
In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us; trial court or appellate proceedings; and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.
Income Taxes
We establish reserves when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged despite our assertion that our tax return positions are fully supportable. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves significant judgment based on individual facts, circumstances and information available in addition to applying complex tax regulations in various jurisdictions across our global operations. Under U.S. GAAP, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows.

Additional Information
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (earnings) and adjusted net income (earnings) per share that exclude certain amounts and operational net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

To calculate adjusted net income (earnings) and adjusted net income (earnings) per share we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income as detailed below. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss) and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share. To calculate operational net sales that exclude changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational growth rate percentages is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.

Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.

We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and operational net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.

The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amortization expense - We record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Intangible asset impairment charges - This amount represents write-downs of certain intangible asset balances during 2017, 2016 and 2015.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment and test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment. If we determine the carrying value of the amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable or we conclude that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-live asset is impaired, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We exclude the impact of impairment charges from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management has excluded intangible asset impairment charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.

• Acquisition-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments may consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments, (b) gains on previously held investments, (c) purchased and/or funded in-process research and development expenses incurred outside of a business combination and (d) due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization and integration and exit costs. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. Due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization and integration and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments represent severance and other direct costs associated with our restructuring plans. These restructuring plans each consist of distinct initiatives that are fundamentally different from our ongoing, core cost reduction initiatives in terms of, among other things, the frequency with which each action is performed and the required planning, resourcing, cost and timing. Examples of such initiatives include the movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities, which, due to the highly regulated nature of our industry, requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines, run product validations and seek regulatory approvals. Restructuring initiatives generally take approximately two years to complete and have a distinct project timeline that begins subsequent to approval by our Board of Directors. In contrast to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, restructuring initiatives typically result in duplicative cost and exit costs over this period of time, are one-time shut downs or transfers and are not considered part of our core, ongoing operations. Because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business, management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Litigation-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. We record these charges and credits, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant, within the litigation-related charges line in our consolidated statements of operations; all other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses. These amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Investment impairment charges - These amounts represent write-downs relating to our investment portfolio that are considered unusual or infrequent and significant. Each reporting period, we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. If we identify an impairment indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value and determine if the impairment is other-than-temporary. For other-than-temporary impairments, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value and its fair value. Management excludes the impact of certain impairment charges when assessing operating performance, as well as from our operating segments’ measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these investment impairment charges for purposes of calculating its non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) net charge - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions as a result of the TCJA, enacted in December 2017. These adjustments, which are estimates, are not indicative of expected on-going operating results. We exclude the impact of this charge from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for the purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.

Operational Net Sales Excluding the Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2017 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...

 ----- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note: The table above does not include unamortized amounts related to interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges.

Revolving Credit Facility

On August 4, 2017, we entered into a $2.250 billion revolving credit facility (the 2017 Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks and terminated our previous $2.000 billion revolving credit facility (the 2015 Facility), which was scheduled to mature in April 2020. The 2017 Facility will mature on August 4, 2022. Eurodollar and multicurrency loans under the 2017 Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin of between 0.90 percent and 1.50 percent, based on our corporate credit ratings (1.10 percent as of December 31, 2017). Under the credit agreement for the 2017 Facility (the 2017 Credit Agreement), we are required to pay a facility fee (0.15 percent as of December 31, 2017) based on our credit ratings and the total amount of revolving credit commitment, regardless of usage of the 2017 Facility. This facility provides backing for the commercial paper program described below. There were no amounts borrowed under our current or prior revolving credit facilities as of December 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.

The 2017 Credit Agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows:

-------------------------- ------------------------------------------- -----------------------------

 CovenantRequirement as of December 31, 2017 Actual as ofDecember 31, 2017
Maximum leverage ratio (1) 3.5 times 2.2 times

(1) Ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit agreement, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.

The 2017 Credit Agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, through maturity, of any non-cash charges and up to $500 million in restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses related to our current or future restructuring plans. As of December 31, 2017, we had $444 million of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the 2017 Credit Agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the 2017 Credit Agreement, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments do not exceed $2.624 billion in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.839 billion of the legal exclusion remaining.

 45

Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers on terms acceptable to us.  In this case, all credit facility commitments would terminate and any amounts borrowed under the facility would become immediately due and payable.  Furthermore, any termination of our credit facility may negatively impact the credit ratings assigned to our commercial paper program which may impact our ability to refinance any then outstanding commercial paper as it becomes due and payable.

Commercial Paper

In June 2017, we launched a commercial paper program that allowed the Company to have a maximum of $2.000 billion in commercial paper outstanding. In August 2017, we increased our commercial paper program’s maximum to $2.250 billion, in line with the increased size of the 2017 Facility. Outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity available under the 2017 Facility. As of December 31, 2017 there was $1.197 billion of commercial paper outstanding. The commercial paper program is backed by the 2017 Facility. Commercial paper issued as of December 31, 2017 had a weighted average maturity of 38 days and a weighted average yield of 1.85 percent.

Term Loans

As of December 31, 2016, we had $750 million outstanding under our unsecured term loan facilities. These facilities included an unsecured term loan for $150 million maturing August 2018 (2018 Term Loan) and an unsecured term loan facility for $600 million maturing August 2020 (2020 Term Loan). Both of these term loan facilities were fully repaid in 2017.

Senior Notes

We had senior notes outstanding of $4.400 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $4.650 billion as of December 31, 2016. On January 12, 2017, we used our existing credit facilities to repay the $250 million plus interest of our senior notes due in January 2017.

Our senior notes were issued in public offerings, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility, to the extent if borrowed by our subsidiaries and to liabilities of our subsidiaries (see Other Arrangements below).

Our $4.050 billion of senior notes issued in 2009, 2013 and 2015 contain a change-in-control provision, which provides that each holder of the senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a price equal to 101 percent of the aggregate repurchased principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if a rating event, as defined in the indenture, occurs as a result of a change-in-control, as defined in the indenture. Any other credit rating changes may impact our borrowing cost, but do not require us to repay any borrowings.

The interest rate payable on our November 2035 Notes is currently 7.00 percent. Corporate credit rating improvements may result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate on our November 2035 Notes to the extent that our lowest credit rating is above BBB- or Baa3. The interest rates on our November 2035 Notes will be permanently reinstated to the issuance rate if the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either A- or A3 or higher.

Other Arrangements

As of December 31, 2016, we maintained a $300 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables maturing on June 9, 2017. In February 2017, we amended the terms of this credit and security facility, including increasing the facility size to $400 million and extending the facility maturity date to February 2019. We had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2017 and $60 million outstanding under our credit and security facility as of December 31, 2016. The credit and security facilities requires that we maintain a maximum leverage covenant consistent with our revolving credit facility.

We have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under FASB ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $456 million as of December 31, 2017. We have no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized $171 million of receivables as of December 31, 2017 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent and $152 million as of December 31, 2016 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent.

In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 22.000 billion Japanese yen (approximately $195 million as of December 31, 2017). We de-recognized $157 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2017 at an average interest rate of 1.3 percent and $149 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2016 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent. De-recognized accounts and notes receivable are excluded from trade accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We had outstanding letters of credit of $49 million as of December 31, 2017 and $44 million as of December 31, 2016, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers']:
Note 8. Long-term Debt In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under the facility. ------- -----------------------------

[' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees, accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.
For additional details related to our debt, including our revolving credit facility, term loans, senior notes and other arrangements, see Note E – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

As of and through December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all the required covenants related to our debt obligations.
Equity
During 2017 we received $85 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $111 million in 2016 and $114 million 2015. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.
We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2017, 2016, or 2015. As of December 31, 2017, we had remaining approximately $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. There were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was $127 million in 2017, $116 million in 2016 and $107 million in 2015. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2017:

(2) Includes accrued interest and penalties and other related items.

The amounts in the table above with respect to lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements.

The table above does not reflect our long-term liability for legal matters that are probable and estimable of $436 million due to the timing of payment being uncertain. Refer to Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our legal accrual.
In addition, the table above does not include $835 million of unrecognized tax benefits, accrued interest and penalties and other related items, because the timing of their future cash settlement is uncertain. Refer to Note I - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.

On January 24, 2018, we closed an investment and entered into an acquisition option agreement with Millipede, Inc. (Millipede). Under the terms of the agreements, we have purchased a portion of the outstanding shares of Millipede along with newly issued shares of the company. We also have the option to acquire the remaining shares of Millipede at any time prior to the completion of a first in human clinical study that meets certain parameters. Upon the completion of the clinical study, Millipede has the option to compel us to acquire the remaining shares of the company. Each company’s option period expires by the end of 2019. Completion of this acquisition would result in an additional $325 million payment by us at closing with a further $125 million becoming payable upon achievement of a commercial milestone. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.

On November 1, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement with an investee company where we may be obligated to pay $145 million in cash up-front and a maximum of $130 million in contingent payments to acquire the investee. The agreement contains a provision, expiring October 31, 2019, allowing the investee company to sell the remaining equity interests of the investee company to us upon achievement of a regulatory milestone and an option allowing us to acquire the remaining equity interests. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.
With certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining R&D cost to complete acquired in-process research and development projects is between $45 million and $55 million. Net cash inflows from the projects currently in development are expected to commence in 2018 and will continue through 2031, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2017.

Legal Matters
For a discussion of our material legal proceedings see Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP.
To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management’s judgment: Revenue Recognition, Bad Debt Reserves, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities, Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes.
See Note A – Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. In addition, see Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments and Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration; Note I - Income Taxes for further discussion on income tax related matters and Note J – Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability matters.

Revenue Recognition
We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.

Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE™ Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Generally, we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.
Inventory Provisions
We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.
Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities
We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.
We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (FASB ASC Topic 350). If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.

Goodwill Valuation

We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently

 49

if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. For our 2017, 2016 and 2015 annual impairment assessment, we identified seven reporting units: Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation. Beginning in 2016, we aggregated the Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology reporting units, components of the Rhythm Management operating segment, based on the criteria prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 350. These reporting units were aggregated due to a reorganization that commenced in 2015 that resulted in integrated leadership, shared resources and consolidation of certain sites in 2016.

In performing the goodwill impairment assessment for 2017 and 2016, we utilized both the optional qualitative assessment and the quantitative approach prescribed under FASB ASC Topic 350. Beginning in 2016, the qualitative assessment was used for testing certain reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 percent. All other reporting units were tested using the quantitative approach described below. The qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on an assessment of relevant events including macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other entity-specific factors. After assessing the totality of events, if it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the quantitative approach of the goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. If it is determined that impairment is more likely than not, then we perform the quantitative impairment test. In 2017, we selected our Rhythm Management operating segment and our Neuromodulation reporting unit for quantitative testing, while the remaining reporting units were qualitatively assessed. For all reporting units tested using the optional qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test as it is not more-likely-than-not such reporting units were impaired. For the two reporting units tested using the quantitative approach, we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.

For our 2017, 2016 and 2015 annual impairment assessments, for those reporting units for which a quantitative test was performed, we used only the income approach, specifically the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.

In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.

Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.

Future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in procedural volumes, pricing pressures, reductions in reimbursement levels, product actions and/or competitive technology developments,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new and next-generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls,

 50

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• decreases in our forecasted profitability due to an inability to implement successfully and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products,

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the level of success of ongoing and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies, achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations, establishing government and third-party payer reimbursement, supplying the market and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully,

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted WACC and increases in our market-participant tax rate and/or changes in tax laws or macroeconomic conditions.

Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.

Refer to Note C - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for additional details related to our annual goodwill balances.
Legal and Product Liability Accruals
In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us; trial court or appellate proceedings; and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.
Income Taxes
We establish reserves when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged despite our assertion that our tax return positions are fully supportable. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves significant judgment based on individual facts, circumstances and information available in addition to applying complex tax regulations in various jurisdictions across our global operations. Under U.S. GAAP, in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit, the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position, and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows.

Additional Information
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (earnings) and adjusted net income (earnings) per share that exclude certain amounts and operational net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.

To calculate adjusted net income (earnings) and adjusted net income (earnings) per share we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income as detailed below. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss) and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share. To calculate operational net sales that exclude changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational growth rate percentages is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.

Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.

We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and operational net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.

The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:
