   OVERVIEW

			3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. As described in Note 17,  effective in the first quarter of 2017, 3M improved the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers. Segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five operating business segments: Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis.

   Table of Contents

Excluding the $762 million impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), net income was $1.285 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share, an increase of 11.7 percent on a per diluted share basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, net income attributable to 3M was $4.858 billion, or $7.93 per diluted share, compared to $5.050 billion, or $8.16 per diluted share, for the full year 2016, a decrease of 2.8 percent on a per diluted share basis. Excluding the 2017 impact related to TCJA, net income was $5.620 billion, or $9.17 per diluted share, an increase of 12.4 percent on a per diluted share basis compared to 2016. The Company refers to various measures excluding the 2017 net impact of enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the section that follows.

			Organic growth/productivity in 2017 includes benefits from higher organic local-currency sales, raw material cost decreases from sourcing cost reduction projects, and business transformation, which is having a positive impact on 3M’s productivity efforts. These benefits were partially offset by higher defined benefit pension expenses. During both the fourth quarter and full year 2017, organic growth and productivity were the primary drivers for the year-on-year benefit.

			Acquisitions and divestitures decreased earnings per diluted share by 2 cents year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2017, while increasing earnings per diluted share by 54 cents year-on-year for the full year 2017. Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate primarily to the acquisition of Scott Safety (fourth quarter 2017). The net impact related to Scott Safety includes income from operations, more than offset by the transaction and integration costs of the acquisition. Interest expense related to financing costs of Scott Safety are also included. The net impact related to Scott Safety was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. Full year 2017 had year-on-year operating income impacts from the following divestitures: Polyfoam and the remaining portion of the library system business (both in first quarter 2016), protective films business and cathode battery technology out-license business (both in fourth quarter 2016), prescription safety eyewear business (January 2017), identity management business and tolling and automated license/number plate recognition business (both in the second quarter of 2017), and electronic monitoring business (fourth quarter 2017). The incremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on divestiture impact, net of lost operating loss/(income) during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $26 million, or approximately 5 cents per diluted share. For the full year 2017, the year-on-year net pre-tax increase from divestitures was approximately $474 million, which is equivalent to a year-on-year increase of 61 cents per diluted share (primarily related to the identity management business). Additional discussion on divestitures is provided later within the “Divestitures and Strategic Investments” section.

			Operating income results include year-on-year incremental strategic investments that decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $51 million and $413 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively. These incremental strategic investments are comprised of 3M’s investments in growth initiatives and optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint. Additional discussion on strategic investments is provided later within the “Divestitures and Strategic Investments” section.

			In the fourth quarter of 2017, as a result of the Company’s regular review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, the Company increased its accruals. This incremental increase resulted in a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. Refer to Note 15 for more details.

			Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $3 million and $111 million year-on-year in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This had a minimal impact per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, and is equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 13 cents per diluted share for the full year 2017.

			Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter and full year 2017 declined 0.1 percent and 1.0 percent year-on-year, respectively, which benefited earnings per share. The Company purchased $504 million and $2.1 billion of its own stock in the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively.

			Other net interest decreased earnings per share for both fourth quarter and full year 2017, largely due to the loss on extinguishment of debt, higher U.S. average balances, and higher interest rates. The early extinguishment of debt resulted in a charge of $96 million, which contributed to a year-on-year decrease of 11 cents per diluted share for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Additionally, the portion of interest expense related to the financing costs of

acquiring Scott Safety, which was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 2 cents per diluted share, is included in the acquisitions and divestitures impact described above.

			As discussed in the section below, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the TCJA, which was equivalent to a decrease of $1.25 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2017 was 68.6 percent, an increase of 40.4 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 23.0 percent in the fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of 5.2 percentage points versus 2016. For the full year 2017, the effective tax rate was 35.5 percent, an increase of 7.2 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the effective income tax rate was 25.4 percent in the full year 2017, a decrease of 2.9 percentage points versus 2016. Excluding the impact of TCJA, the fourth quarter and full year 2017 change in tax rate was driven largely by increasing benefits from our supply chain centers of expertise, favorable geographic mix and other items, as referenced in Note 9.

			Income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -  (non-GAAP measures):

			During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance. See additional information in Note 9. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the net impact of enactment of the TCJA. This item represents a significant charge that impacted the Company’s financial results. Income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and an adjusted measure. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. The Company considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing the Company’s operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for this item is meaningful to investors as it provides a useful analysis of ongoing underlying operating trends. The determination of this item may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

   Year 2016 EPS:

			For total year 2016, productivity and other increased earnings, helped by lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expenses, higher selling prices, lower raw material costs, and productivity benefits related to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of flat organic sales and lower asset utilization.

			Acquisition and divestiture impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related to the acquisitions of Membrana and Capital Safety (third quarter 2015) and Semfinder (September 2016), and the divestitures of Polyfoam (first quarter 2016), the library systems business (fourth quarter 2015/first quarter 2016), and the license plate converting business in France (fourth quarter 2015). In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. On a combined basis, these acquisition/divestiture year-on-year impacts resulted in a 14 cents per diluted share benefit to earnings per share in 2016, driven by solid performances from 2015 acquisitions and year-on-year divestiture gains. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of these acquisition/divestiture impacts.

			Restructuring actions (included within incremental strategic investments in the preceding table) resulted in an after-tax charge of 14 cents per diluted share in 2015, which provided a year-on-year benefit in 2016.

			Foreign exchange impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $127 million year-on-year in 2016, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes on tax rates. This was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 14 cents per diluted share for 2016.

			Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding  in 2016 declined 3 percent versus 2015, which benefited earnings per share. The benefits from share repurchases, net of issuances, were partially offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, which increased the calculated number of diluted shares in 2016.

   Higher average debt balances led to an increase in interest expense year-on-year in 2016.

			The income tax rate was 28.3 percent in 2016, a decline of 0.8 percentage points versus last year. The 2016 change in tax rate was driven by a number of factors as referenced in Note 9, including the first quarter 2016 adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09 (discussed in Note 1).

			From a business segment perspective, 3M achieved both total sales growth and organic local-currency sales growth (which includes organic volume and selling price impacts) in all five business segments. Operating income margins were 22.8 percent, with four of five business segments above 22 percent.

 · In Industrial, total sales increased 6.9 percent, or 3.9 percent on an organic local currency basis, with organic sales growth in abrasives, automotive and aerospace solutions, industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket, and separation and purification. Organic sales declined in advanced materials. Operating income margins were 19.4 percent, down 2.5 percentage points, with the decline driven by incremental strategic investments and a fourth quarter 2016 gain on sale of the temporary protective films business.

 · In Safety and Graphics, total sales increased 15.0 percent, or 10.7 percent on an organic local currency basis. Organic sales grew in all businesses, led by personal safety, roofing granules, and transportation safety. Operating income margins were 26.3 percent, up 6.1 percentage points, with 2.4 percentage points of this increase driven by divestitures, partially offset by acquisitions and incremental strategic investments.

 · In Health Care, total sales increased 6.0 percent, or 3.1 percent on an organic local currency sales basis. Organic sales grew in food safety, health information systems, medical consumables, and oral care. Organic sales declined in drug delivery systems. Operating income margins were 31.5 percent, up 1.8 percentage points.

 · In Electronics and Energy, total sales increased 12.5 percent, or 11.0 percent on an organic local currency basis. Electronics-related organic sales increased 14 percent, with growth in both electronics materials solutions and display materials and systems. Energy-related organic sales increased 4 percent as growth in electrical markets was partially offset by declines in telecommunications markets. Operating income margins were 25.2 percent, down 2.5 percentage points. The fourth quarter 2016 gain on sale of intellectual property and fourth quarter 2017 incremental strategic investments negatively impacted operating income margins by 3.3 percentage points.

 · In the Asia Pacific geographic area, where 3M’s Electronics and Energy business is concentrated, sales benefited from strengthened demand across most electronics market segments in addition to strong growth in 3M’s Safety and Graphics business. In China/Hong Kong, total sales increased 21 percent and organic local-currency sales increased 18 percent. In Japan, total sales increased 6 percent, as organic local-currency sales growth of 7 percent was partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts.

 · In the EMEA geographic area, Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa had total sales increase by 14 percent, with organic local-currency sales increases of 12 percent. West Europe total sales grew 18 percent, driven by foreign currency translation impacts, in addition to organic local-currency sales growth of 5 percent.

 · In the Latin America/Canada geographic area, total sales increased 7 percent in Mexico, driven by foreign currency translation impacts, in addition to organic local-currency sales growth of 3 percent. In Canada, total sales increased 13 percent, driven by organic local-currency sales growth of 8 percent. In Brazil, total sales and organic local-currency sales increased 3 percent.

			Selling prices were up 0.2 percent year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2017. In Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price. EMEA and Latin America/Canada had price growth, while U.S. selling prices declined slightly.

 · In the Asia Pacific geographic area, where 3M’s Electronics and Energy business is concentrated, sales benefited from strengthened demand across most electronics market segments, in addition to strong growth in 3M’s Safety and Graphics business. Total sales in China/Hong Kong grew 16 percent and Japan grew 5 percent. On an organic local-currency sales basis, China/Hong Kong grew 18 percent and Japan grew 8 percent.

 · In the EMEA geographic area, Central/East Europe and Middle East/Africa total sales and organic local-currency grew 5 percent. West Europe total sales grew 5 percent, with organic local-currency sales growth of 3 percent along with an increase related to foreign currency translation.

 · In the Latin America/Canada geographic area, total sales increased 4 percent in Mexico, as organic local-currency sales growth of 6 percent was partially offset by divestitures. In Canada, total sales increased 8 percent, with organic-local currency sales growth of 7 percent. In Brazil total sales growth of 9 percent was driven by foreign currency translation, while organic local-currency sales increased 2 percent.

			Foreign currency translation increased year-on-year sales by 0.5 percent, with the translation-related sales increase in Latin America/Canada and EMEA partially offset by the decreases in Asia Pacific. Selling prices were flat year-on-year for 2017. In Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price. Latin America/Canada and EMEA had price growth, while the U.S. selling prices declined slightly.

   Financial condition:

			3M generated $6.2 billion of operating cash flow in 2017, a decrease of $422 million when compared to 2016. This followed an increase of  $242 million when comparing 2016 to 2015. Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2017, the Company purchased $2.1 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $3.8 billion in 2016 and $5.2 billion in 2015. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $5.0 billion of its own stock in 2018. In January 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2018 dividend of $1.36 per share, an increase of 16 percent. This marked the 60th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating,

   25

   Table of Contents

with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.

   Raw materials:

			In 2017, the Company continued to manage year-on-year raw material input costs, benefiting from input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. These efforts more than offset increasing costs in certain raw material categories in oil-derivative chemical feedstock markets. Oil-derivative cost increases also impact other feedstock categories, including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.

   Pension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:

			On a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 87 percent funded at year-end 2017. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 94 percent funded and the international pension plans were 90 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2017 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were 12.4%, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2018 is 7.25%, consistent with 2017. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2017 discount rate was 3.68%, down 0.53 percentage points from the year-end 2016 discount rate of 4.21%. The decrease in U.S. discount rates resulted in an increased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plan’s funded status increased 4 percentage points in 2017 as strong plan assets returns and $800 million in contributions increased asset values in excess of the higher PBO due to the significant discount rate decline. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 12 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).

			3M expects to contribute approximately $300 million to $500 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2018. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2018. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2018 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to increase by approximately $76 million pre-tax when compared to 2017. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” within MD&A and Note 12 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3M’s pension and post-retirement plans.

   Divestitures and strategic investments:

			In both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, the Company continued to accelerate investments in growth initiatives and footprint optimization. In addition, the Company divested certain businesses as it continued to focus its portfolio on opportunities that create greater value for its shareholders. As shown below, these divestitures and strategic investments led to a net year-on-year decrease of approximately $0.01 per diluted share and a benefit of $0.10 per diluted share, respectively, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017:

			2017 announced and 2018 closed divestitures:

			In December 2017, 3M announced it had reached an agreement to sell substantially all of its Communications Markets Division, which consists of optical fiber and copper passive connectivity solutions, structured cabling solutions, and telecommunications system integration services. The business has annual global sales of approximately $400 million. The Company expects a pre-tax gain of approximately $500 million in 2018 as a result of this divestiture. 3M expects to realize a gain of approximately $0.40 per diluted share from this transaction, net of actions related to this divestiture. Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion.

			In February 2018, 3M closed on the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring. This business has annual sales of approximately $15 million. The transaction is expected to result in a pre-tax gain of less than $20 million that will be reported within the Company’s Safety and Graphics business. Refer to Note 2 for additional discussion.

Operating income margin 24.7 % 24.0 % 22.9 % 0.7 % 1.1 %

			Operating income margins increased in 2017 versus 2016, driven by gains from sale of businesses, partially offset by cost of sales increases. A number of factors impact the various income statement line items, such as raw material cost management, strategic investments, divestitures, foreign currency, cost management, and pension and postretirement effects. Expanded discussion of each of the income statement line items follows in the various sections below. Pension and postretirement expense is recorded in cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A); and research, development and related expenses (R&D). In total, 3M’s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense increased $82 million in 2017, compared to a decrease of $305 million in 2016. Refer to Note 12 (Pension and Postretirement Plans) for components of net periodic benefit cost and the assumptions used to determine net cost.

			The Company is investing in business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis.

			In 2017, as referenced above in the “Divestitures and strategic investments” section, 3M incurred $413 million in incremental strategic actions, primarily reported within the cost of sales and SG&A income statement line items.

			Of these strategic investments, 3M incurred $96 million (net of adjustments) in restructuring actions and $47 million in exit activities during 2017. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2015, 3M incurred $114 million in restructuring charges. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the impact to operating expenses.

   Cost of Sales:

   Cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.

			Cost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments in productivity, portfolio actions and footprint optimization, foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher defined benefit pension expense. This was partially offset by a year-on-year reduction in raw material input costs as a result of sourcing cost reduction projects. Selling prices were flat year-on-year for the full year 2017.

			Cost of sales as a percent of sales decreased in 2016 due to the combination of selling price increases and raw material cost decreases, as selling prices increased net sales by 0.7 percent and raw material cost deflation was favorable by approximately 3.5 percent year-on-year. In addition, cost of sales as a percent of sales benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement costs. Fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable year-on-year comparison.

   28

   Table of Contents

   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:

			SG&A increased $350 million year-on year, or 5.6 percent, during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments and higher defined benefit pension expense. SG&A decreased $7 million, or 0.1 percent, in 2016 when compared to 2015, with 2016 results benefiting from foreign currency translation, and productivity benefits related to the fourth quarter 2015 restructuring. In addition, SG&A in 2016 benefited from lower defined benefit pension and postretirement expense. Fourth quarter 2015 restructuring charges also provided a favorable year-on-year comparison.

   Research, Development and Related Expenses:

			R&D increased $115 million year-on-year and decreased $28 million year-on-year in 2017 and 2016, respectively. 3M continued to invest in its key initiatives, including R&D aimed at disruptive innovation programs with the potential to create entirely new markets and disrupt existing markets. R&D, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.8 percent in 2017, 2016, and 2015.

   Gain on Sale of Businesses:

			In 2017, 3M sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business, completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable, of its identity management business, sold its tolling and automated license/number plate recognition and electronic monitoring businesses, and sold the assets of its electrical marking/labeling business. On a combined basis, these divestitures resulted in a gain on the sale of businesses of $586 million. 3M also divested certain businesses in 2016 and 2015, resulting in gains of $111 million and $47 million, respectively. Refer to Note 2 for additional detail on these divestitures.

   Operating Income Margin:

			3M uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. Refer to the table below for a reconciliation of operating income margins for 2017 and 2016.

------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ - ----------------- - ----------------- -
 Three months ended Year ended

Foreign exchange impacts (0.6) (0.5) (0.2)
Pension and postretirement benefit costs (0.2) (0.3) 1.0
Current period 22.8 % 24.7 % 24.0 %

   Year 2017 and fourth quarter operating income:

			Operating income margins increased 0.1 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 0.7 percentage points for the full year 2017 when compared to the same periods last year. 3M benefited from higher organic local-currency sales growth and productivity, partially offset by actuarial adjustments to the Company’s respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual. Acquisitions and divestitures consist of the transactions and integration costs, net of income, that relate to the acquisition of Scott Safety, in addition to the year-on-year divestiture gains (refer to Note 2) and non-repeating operating losses from divested businesses, which combined, reduced operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2017 and benefited operating income margins for the full year 2017. Items that reduced operating margins were incremental strategic investments in growth, productivity and portfolio actions, in addition to charges related to 3M’s optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint. For full year 2017, the benefit from year-on-year divestiture gains and non-repeating net operating losses from divested businesses (primarily related to the sale of Identity

   29

   Table of Contents

Management) was partially offset by the impact of the Scott Safety acquisition noted earlier. 3M also benefited from raw material sourcing cost reduction projects. Lastly, operating margins were reduced by foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher year-on-year defined benefit pension expense.

   Year 2016 operating income:

			Operating income margins were 24.0 percent in 2016 compared to 22.9 percent in 2015, an increase of 1.1 percentage points. 3M benefited from the combination of higher selling prices and lower raw material costs, plus lower year-on-year defined benefit pension and postretirement expense. Acquisitions and divestitures had a favorable impact on operating margins. This included solid performances from both the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions. Divestiture impacts relate to the Polyfoam business, the library systems business, and the license plate converting business in France. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business. Items that reduced operating income margins included 2016 strategic investments, as 3M took actions to better optimize its manufacturing footprint and accelerated growth investments across its businesses. Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) also reduced operating income margins. Organic volume, productivity, and other decreased operating margins as a result of lower asset utilization, primarily in the Industrial, and Electronics and Energy businesses. Also, 3M had an unfavorable arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. These declines within organic volume, productivity, and other were partially offset by 2015 restructuring charges, which provided a favorable year-on-year comparison, and productivity benefits in 2016 related to the 2015 restructuring actions.

   Other Expense (Income), Net:

   See Note 5 for a detailed breakout of this line item.

			Interest expense increased during 2017 and 2016 due to higher average debt balances and higher U.S. borrowing costs. In addition, in October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was included within interest expense. Capitalized interest related to property, plant and equipment construction in progress is recorded as a reduction to interest expense. Capitalized interest was $12 million, $10 million, and $13 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

			Interest income increased year-on-year in both 2017 and 2016 due to higher average interest rates.

   Provision for Income Taxes:

--------------------------- ---- - ---- - ---- -
(Percent of pre-tax income) 2017 2016 2015
Effective tax rate 35.5 % 28.3 % 29.1 %

			The effective tax rate for 2017 was 35.5 percent, compared to 28.3 percent in 2016, an increase of 7.2 percentage points. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 28.3 percent, compared to 29.1 percent in 2015, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points. The changes in the tax rates between years were impacted by many factors, including the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in December 2017 as further described in the Overview, “Income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -(non-GAAP measures)” section and in Note 9. During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense of $762 million related to the enactment of the TCJA. The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. This provisional amount is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance.

			The TCJA establishes new tax laws that will also affect 2018 and future periods, including, but not limited to: 1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, 2) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), 3) the creation of a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), 4) a

   Table of Contents

general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, 5) limitations on the use of foreign tax credits to reduce the U.S. income tax liability, 6) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, and 7) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction. Considering the impacts of the TCJA and other factors, the Company currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 20 to 22 percent. The tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, measurement period adjustment effects on the provisional items and remaining analyses to complete noted in Note 9 related to the 2017 impact of the TCJA, employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.

   Refer to Note 9 for further discussion of income taxes.

   Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest:

-------------------------------------------------- ---- -- ---- - ---- - -
(Millions) 2017 2016 2015
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest $ 11 $ 8 $ 8

			Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. The amount primarily relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M’s effective ownership is 75 percent.

   Currency Effects:

			3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $111 million and $127 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. These estimates include the effect of translating profits from local currencies into U.S. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3M operations in the United States and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3M estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $152 million and $69 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Refer to Note 13 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning 3M’s hedging activities.

   PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

			For a detailed discussion of the markets served and types of products offered by 3M’s business segments, see Item 1, Business Segments. Financial information and other disclosures are provided in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective in the first quarter of 2017, as part of 3M’s continuing effort to improve the alignment of its businesses around markets and customers, the Company made the following changes:

   Integration of former Renewable Energy Division

 · 3M’s former Renewable Energy Division (RED) has been integrated into existing divisions within the Electronics and Energy business segment and Safety and Graphics business segment. 3M is committed to leadership in sustainability and to enabling the advancement of energy solutions into the future. Integrating RED’s offerings into larger divisions already serving these segments will provide increased scale and build on strength by leveraging 3M’s existing brands, go-to-market capabilities, and relationships to support growth objectives.

   Creation of Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division

 · 3M created the Automotive and Aerospace Solutions Division, which combined the former Automotive Division and Aerospace and Commercial Transportation Division, which were both within the Industrial business segment. Combining the strengths along with the deep industry knowledge of each business will enable this new division to utilize shared technology platforms and processes to deliver a broader set of innovative solutions, along with world-class quality and service to 3M’s customers. This combination will help accelerate the Company’s profitable growth and market relevance across the automotive, aerospace and commercial transportation industries.

   31

   Table of Contents

   Consolidation of U.S. customer account activity - impacting dual credit reporting

 · The Company consolidated its customer account activity in the U.S. into more centralized sales districts. This improved alignment reduces the complexity for customers when interacting with multiple businesses within 3M, creating a better customer experience. 3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain U.S. sales and related operating income. This dual credit is based on which business segment provides customer account activity with respect to a particular product sold in the U.S. The alignment of U.S. customer accounts to fewer, more focused sales districts changed the attribution of dual credit across 3M’s business segments.

   Business segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in five business segments. The reportable segments are Industrial; Safety and Graphics; Health Care; Electronics and Energy; and Consumer.

   Corporate and Unallocated:

			In addition to these five business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 17. Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the Company determines not to allocate directly to its business segments. Because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.

			Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses increased by $80 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. In both the first and second quarters of 2017, a portion of the severance actions were reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In the fourth quarter, an incremental $58 million was reflected within Corporate and Unallocated related to the Company’s actuarial adjustments to its respirator mask/asbestos liability accrual. In addition, 3M’s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated increased by approximately $30 million in 2017.

			Corporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased by $77 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. 3M’s defined benefit pension and postretirement expense allocation to Corporate and Unallocated decreased by $223 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. In addition, the portion of the 2015 restructuring actions charged to corporate ($37 million) provided a favorable year-on-year comparison. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal expenses related to an unfavorable second quarter 2016 arbitration ruling on an insurance claim, commercial litigation settlements related to Andover Healthcare and TransWeb, and accruals for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities.

   Operating Business Segments:

   Each of 3M’s business segments were impacted by the following pre-tax amounts:

   PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA

			While 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3M’s operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3M’s results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 18.

   Refer to the “Overview” section for a summary of net sales by geographic area and business segment.

   Employment:

			Employment decreased by 48 positions in 2017 and increased by 2,138 positions in 2016.

   Capital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment:

			Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. In 2017, 62% of 3M’s capital spending was within the United States, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Latin America/Canada. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled “Cash Flows from Investing Activities.”

   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

			Information regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

			The Company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the Company’s pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3M’s Board of Directors.

   Legal Proceedings:

			The categories of claims for which the Company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. Please refer to the section entitled “Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings” (contained in “Legal Proceedings” in Note 15) for additional information about such estimates.

   Pension and Postretirement Obligations:

			3M has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 715, Compensation — Retirement Benefits, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. ASC 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan

   39

   Table of Contents

as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders’ equity. While the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. See Note 12 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.

			Pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant’s years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Historically, the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan’s benefit obligation was also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit costs, including the measurement of the service and interest costs. Beginning in 2016, 3M changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs. The new method measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2016.

   Using this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:

------------------------------------------ ---------------------- - ---------------------------------------- - --------------------------- -
 U.S. Qualified Pension International Pension (weighted average) U.S. Postretirement Medical
December 31, 2017 Liability:
Benefit obligation 3.68 % 2.41 % 3.60 %
2018 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:
Service cost 3.78 % 2.28 % 3.77 %
Interest cost 3.35 % 2.14 % 3.20 %

			Another significant element in determining the Company’s pension expense in accordance with ASC 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2018 is 7.25%, equal to 2017. Refer to Note 12 for information on how the 2017 rate was determined. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 5.02% for 2018, compared to 5.16% for 2017.

			For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) of $333 million, up from $251 million in 2016. Defined benefit pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) is anticipated to increase to approximately $409 million in 2018, an increase of $76 million compared to 2017.

			The table below summarizes the impact on 2018 pension expense for the U.S. and international pension plans of a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions

   Asset Impairments:

			As of December 31, 2017, net property, plant and equipment totaled $8.9 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $2.9 billion. Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.

			Of the $2.9 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 2 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter of 2017, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradename exceeded its book value by more than 15 percent.

			3M goodwill totaled approximately $10.5 billion as of December 31, 2017. 3M’s annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.

			An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.

			As described in Note 17, effective in the first quarter of 2017, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. The discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2017 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.

			As of October 1, 2017, 3M had 24 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 86 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Communication Markets, Display Materials and Systems, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and

   41

   Table of Contents

Tapes, Infection Prevention, Oral Care Solutions, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification, and Transportation Safety. The estimated fair value for all reporting units was in excess of carrying value by approximately 40 percent or more. 3M’s market value at both December 31, 2017, and September 30, 2017, was significantly in excess of its shareholders’ equity of approximately $12 billion.

			As discussed in Note 2, 3M announced the sale of substantially all of its Communication Markets division, which is expected to close in 2018, which will result in an associated goodwill reduction of approximately $270 million upon sale.

			In 2017, 3M determined fair values using either an industry price-earnings ratio approach or a discounted cash flows analysis. Where applicable, 3M used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for certain divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. The weighting was based on management’s estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring.

			3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M’s businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M’s focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M’s value being comprised of internally developed businesses that have no goodwill associated with them. Based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2017, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.

			Factors which could result in future impairment charges include, among others, changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These risk factors are discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document. In addition, changes in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing results. As indicated above, during the first quarter of 2017, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by changes between reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Long-lived assets with a definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2018 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.

   Income Taxes:

			The extent of 3M’s operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 9 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company’s current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.

			During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries and is net of remeasurement of 3M’s deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the TCJA’s newly enacted tax rates and certain other impacts. As discussed in Note 9, this expense is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance.

   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

   Information regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

			The strength and stability of 3M’s business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the Company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3M’s businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 9 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.

			3M’s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M’s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2017, there was approximately $745 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.

   Total Debt:

			The strength of 3M’s capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company’s maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service.

			The Company’s total debt was $2.3 billion higher at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Increases in debt related to October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at year end 2017, and the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These are partially offset by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 million debt tender. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” section.

			Effective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its “well-known seasoned issuer” (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M’s previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company’s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.

			As of December 31, 2017, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and the 2017 debt referenced above, is approximately $13.1 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the Euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 11.

			In March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders’ discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility is undrawn at December 31, 2017. Under the $3.75 billion credit

agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2017, this ratio was approximately 29 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional $288 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2017. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.

   Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:

			At December 31, 2017, 3M had $4.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.975 billion was held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and approximately $180 million was held by the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2016, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and by the United States totaled approximately $2.35 billion and $350 million, respectively. Specifics concerning marketable securities investments are provided in Note 10.

   Net Debt (non-GAAP measure):

			Net debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

------------------------------------------------------ ------------ ------ ---- ----------- ------ - -----
 December 31, 2017 versus
(Millions) 2017 2016 2016

Net debt (non-GAAP measure) $ 9,793 $ 8,955 $ 838

   Refer to the preceding “Total Debt” and “Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities” sections for additional details.

   Balance Sheet:

			3M’s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.

			The Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets. These measures include working capital, accounts receivable turns, and inventory turns.

   Working Capital (non-GAAP measure):

---------------------------------- ------------ ------ ----------- ------ - -----
 December 31, 2017 versus
(Millions) 2017 2016 2016
Current assets $ 14,277 $ 11,726 $ 2,551
Less: Current liabilities 7,687 6,219 1,468
Working capital (non-GAAP measure) $ 6,590 $ 5,507 $ 1,083

			Various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.

   44

   Table of Contents

			Working capital increased $1.1 billion during 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Current asset balance changes increased working capital by $2.6 billion, driven by increases in cash/cash equivalents and marketable securities, in addition to higher accounts receivable and inventories (discussed further below). Current liability balance changes decreased working capital by $1.5 billion, largely due to increases in short-term borrowings, with commercial paper outstanding of $745 million at December 31, 2017 compared to none outstanding at December 31, 2016.

   Accounts Receivable and Inventory Turns (non-GAAP measures):

			Accounts receivable and inventory turns are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. 3M defines accounts receivable turns as quarterly net sales multiplied by 4 divided by ending accounts receivable – net, and defines inventory turns as quarterly manufacturing cost multiplied by 4 divided by ending inventory. 3M believes accounts receivable turns is meaningful to investors as a measure of how efficiently the Company manages credit and collects from its customers. For inventory turns calculation purposes, manufacturing cost is defined as cost of sales less freight and engineering costs. 3M believes inventory turns is meaningful to investors as a measure of how quickly inventory is sold. Details of these calculations follow.

-------------------------------------------- ------------ ----- ----------- ----- - ------
Accounts receivable turns (non-GAAP measure) December 31, 2017 versus
(Millions, except turns) 2017 2016 2016
Quarterly net sales $ 7,990 $ 7,329 $ 661
Ending accounts receivable - net $ 4,911 $ 4,392 $ 519
Accounts receivable turns 6.51 6.67 (0.16)

---------------------------------- ------------ ----- ----------- ----- - ------
Inventory turns (non-GAAP measure) December 31, 2017 versus
(Millions, except turns) 2017 2016 2016
Quarterly cost of sales $ 4,080 $ 3,716 $ 364
Less: Freight and engineering $ 172 $ 160 $ 12
Manufacturing cost $ 3,908 $ 3,556 $ 352
Ending inventory $ 4,034 $ 3,385 $ 649
Inventory turns 3.88 4.20 (0.32)

			Accounts receivable increased $519 million year-on-year in 2017, primarily due to increased sales. In addition, foreign currency impacts increased 2017 accounts receivable by $215 million and acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased accounts receivable by $57 million. As a result, accounts receivable turns decreased 2 percent versus 2016.

			Inventory increased $649 million year-on-year in 2017. Foreign currency impacts increased 2017 inventory by $210 million and acquisitions, net of divestitures, increased inventory by $51 million. Higher fourth quarter sales contributed to a 10 percent increase in cost of sales, while inventory increased 19 percent, which combined contributed to an 8 percent decrease in inventory turns.

			On a seasonal basis, both accounts receivable and inventory turns are historically higher at year-end, driven by lower year-end accounts receivable and inventory balances.

   Return on Invested Capital (non-GAAP measure):

   Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Therefore, ROIC should not be considered a substitute for other measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines ROIC as adjusted net income (net income including non-controlling interest plus after-tax interest expense) divided by average invested capital (equity plus debt). The Company believes ROIC is meaningful to investors as it focuses on shareholder value creation. The calculation is provided in the below table.

			In 2017, ROIC of 21.3 percent was lower than both 2016 and 2015. This decrease related to the net impact of the enactment of the TCJA and increases in commercial paper borrowings in conjunction with the December 2017 U.S. defined benefit pension plan contribution, which combined reduced ROIC by 3 percentage points in 2017.

			Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.

			In 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $608 million in 2017, compared to working capital increases of $108 million in 2016. In 2017, year-on-year decreases in income tax payments (net of refunds) increased operating cash flows by $284 million. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the “Financial Condition and Liquidity” section. Information concerning defined benefit pension and postretirement contributions and expense is provided in Note 12, with additional discussion in the preceding Results of Operations section. Gain on sale of businesses in the preceding table reflects an adjustment for divestiture gains in 2017 (discussed in Note 2), as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing activities, not operating activities.

			In 2016, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $242 million compared to the same period in 2015, with this increase primarily due to lower year-on-year cash taxes and higher net income. These items were partially offset by higher Company pension contributions. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $108 million in 2016, compared to working capital increase of $46 million in 2015. Gain on sale of businesses in the preceding table reflects an adjustment for divestiture gains in 2016 (discussed in Note 2), as cash divestiture activity is presented as proceeds from sale of businesses within investing activities, not operating activities.

			Investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. The Company expects 2018 capital spending to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses.

			3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities, plus research facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and corporate laboratory facilities.

			Investments included continued expansion and sustainment of current and new facilities across many geographies, focusing on growth, productivity and capacity. Other investments include IT systems and infrastructure, particularly the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system on a worldwide basis. Additional specific investments in 2015 included a new state-of-the-art, four story, 400,000 square foot research facility at 3M Center in St. Paul, Minnesota.

			Refer to Note 2 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances to strengthen its portfolio, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses.

			Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, in 2017 primarily includes the purchase of Scott Safety. In 2015, this amount consisted mostly of the Capital Safety and Membrana acquisitions. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2017 primarily relate to the divestiture of the assets of the prescription safety eyewear, identity management, tolling and automated license/number plate recognition and electronic monitoring businesses within the Safety and Graphics business segment. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2016 related to the divestiture of the assets of the pressurized polyurethane foam adhesives business (formerly known as Polyfoam) within the Industrial business segment and the completion of the divestiture of the Library business within the Safety and Graphics business segment. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2016, 3M sold the assets of its protective films business within the Industrial business segment and its cathode battery technology out-licensing business within the Electronics and Energy business segment.

			Purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Net proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities in 2015 were used to help fund the August 2015 acquisitions of Capital Safety and Membrana. Refer to Note 10 for more details about 3M’s diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus cost method and equity investments.

   2017 Debt Activity:

			The Company’s total debt was $2.3 billion higher at December 31, 2017 when compared to December 31, 2016. Increases in debt related to October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at year end 2017, and the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries. These are partially offset by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 million debt tender. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in “Change in short-term debt – net” in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also impacted debt balances.

			Proceeds from debt for 2017 primarily related to the October 2017 issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 2.25%, $850 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2027 with a coupon rate of 2.875%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2047 with a coupon rate of 3.625%. Refer to Note 11 for more detail of these debt issuances.

			In October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $110 million of its $330 million principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2028 and $195 million of its $750 million principal amount of 5.70% notes due 2037. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within interest expense associated with the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses.

   2016 Debt Activity:

			Total debt at December 31, 2016 increased $853 million when compared to year-end 2015, with the increase primarily due to May 2016 debt issuances (approximately $1.1 billion at issue date exchange rates) and September 2016 debt issuances of approximately $1.75 billion. This increase was partially offset by the repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes due September 2016 along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea (approximately $0.8 million decrease), which is reflected in “Change in short-term debt—net” in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also impacted debt balances.

			Proceeds from debt for 2016 primarily related to the May 2016 issuance of 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 5.75-year fixed rate medium-term notes due February 2022 with a coupon rate of 0.375% and 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 15-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2031 with a coupon rate of 1.50%. In September 2016, 3M issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 with a coupon rate of 1.625%, $650 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2026 with a coupon rate of 2.250%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2046 with a coupon rate of 3.125%. All of these 2016 issuances were under the medium-term notes program (Series F).

   2015 Debt Activity:

			In 2015, the change in short-term debt primarily related to bank borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea. Repayment of debt primarily related to debt assumed (and paid off) as part of the Capital Safety acquisition. Proceeds from debt primarily related to the May 2015 issuance of 650 million Euros aggregate principal amount of five-year floating rate medium-term notes due 2020, 600 million Euros aggregate principal amount of eight-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023, and 500 million Euros aggregate principal amount of fifteen-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2030, which in the aggregate total approximately $1.9 billion at issue date exchange rates. In addition, August 2015 issuances included $450 million aggregate principal amount of three-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2018, $500 million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2020, and $550 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2025, which in aggregate total $1.5 billion.

   Repurchases of Common Stock:

			Repurchases of common stock are made to support the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In February 2016, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock. This authorization has no pre-established end date. In 2017, the Company purchased $2.1 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $3.8 billion and $5.2 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company expects full-year 2018 gross share repurchases to be between $2.0 billion to $5.0 billion. For more information, refer to the table titled “Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Company’s stock.

   Dividends Paid to Shareholders:

			Cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $2.803 billion ($4.70 per share) in 2017, $2.678 billion ($4.44 per share) in 2016, and $2.561 billion ($4.10 per share) in 2015. 3M has paid dividends since 1916. In January 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2018 dividend of $1.36 per share, an increase of 16 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.44 per share and marked the 60th consecutive year of dividend increases.

			Other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases. In addition, in 2017, this included a payment related to the $96 million in interest expense associated with premiums and fees for the early retirement of debt. See Note 11 for additional details.

   Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):

			Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. The first quarter of each year is typically 3M’s seasonal low for free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for 2017, 2016 and 2015.

			In 2017, free cash flow conversion was impacted by enactment of the TCJA, along with an additional U.S. pension contribution of $600 million that 3M made following the signing of tax reform. On a combined basis, these items benefited free cash flow conversion by 3 percentage points. Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” section for discussion of additional items that impacted operating cash flow. Refer to the preceding “Cash Flows from Investing Activities” section for discussion on capital spending for property, plant and equipment.

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations:

			As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Refer to the section entitled “Warranties/Guarantees” in Note 15 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.

			In addition to guarantees, 3M, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the Company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3M products or the negligence of 3M personnel, or claims alleging that 3M products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. While 3M’s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

   A summary of the Company’s significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017, follows:

Total contractual cash obligations $ 20,804 $ 3,546 $ 1,440 $ 1,997 $ 1,844 $ 1,663 $ 10,314

			Long-term debt payments due in 2018, 2019, and 2020 include floating rate notes totaling $54 million, $71 million, and $95 million, respectively, as a result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments.

			During the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The expense is primarily related to the TCJA’s transition tax. The transition tax is payable over 8 years at the election of the taxpayer. As discussed in Note 9, this balance is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by recent SEC guidance.

			Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Company’s expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3M’s products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Company’s expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.

			Other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled “Unconditional purchase obligations and other,” include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments, other than the transition tax prescribed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) which is separately included in the table

above, or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $523 million is excluded from the preceding table. Refer to Note 9 for further details.

			As discussed in Note 12, the Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2018 and Company contributions to its U.S. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.

   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

			The Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.

			Refer to Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").

NOTE 17. INDUSTRY SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our CEO, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. For fiscal 2017, we have the following reportable segments: - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ * Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere.

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...
