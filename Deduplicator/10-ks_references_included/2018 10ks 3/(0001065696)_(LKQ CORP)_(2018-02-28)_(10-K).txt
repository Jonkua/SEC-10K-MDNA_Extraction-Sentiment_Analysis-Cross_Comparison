ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview
We are a global distributor of vehicle products, including replacement parts, components and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty products and accessories to improve the performance, functionality and appearance of vehicles.
Buyers of vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily five sources: new products produced by original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"); new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles; used products that have been refurbished; and used products that have been remanufactured. We distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products; recycled collision and mechanical products; refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights; and remanufactured engines. Collectively, we refer to the four sources that are not new OEM products as alternative parts.
We are a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States and Canada. We are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in Europe. In addition to our wholesale operations, we operate self service retail facilities across the U.S. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles. We are also a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the U.S. and Canada.
We are organized into four operating segments: Wholesale – North America; Europe; Specialty and Self Service. We aggregate our Wholesale – North America and Self Service operating segments into one reportable segment, North America, resulting in three reportable segments: North America, Europe and Specialty.
Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Please refer to the factors discussed in Forward-Looking Statements in Part I, Item 1 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
Acquisitions and Investments
Since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. We have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. We target companies that are market leaders, will expand our geographic presence and will enhance our ability to provide a wide array of vehicle products to our customers through our distribution network.
On July 3, 2017, we acquired four aftermarket parts distribution businesses in Belgium. The objective of these acquisitions is to transform the existing three-step distribution model in Belgium to a two-step distribution model to align with our Netherlands operations.
On November 1, 2017, we acquired Warn Industries, Inc. ("Warn"), a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of high performance vehicle equipment and accessories. We expect the acquisition of Warn to expand LKQ's presence in the specialty market and create viable points of entry into related markets.
In addition to the aftermarket parts distribution businesses acquired in Belgium and the acquisition of Warn, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed 21 acquisitions, including 6 wholesale businesses in North America, 12 wholesale businesses in Europe and 3 Specialty vehicle aftermarket businesses.
On December 10, 2017, LKQ and its wholly-owned subsidiary LKQ German Holdings GmbH entered into an agreement to acquire Stahlgruber, a leading European wholesale distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars, tools, capital equipment and accessories with operations in Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia with further sales to Switzerland. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018 and is subject to regulatory approvals. This acquisition will expand LKQ's geographic presence in continental Europe and serve as an additional strategic hub for our European operations. In addition, we believe this acquisition will allow for continued improvement in procurement, logistics and infrastructure optimization.
On March 18, 2016, we acquired Rhiag, a distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles in Italy, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Poland and Spain. This acquisition expanded LKQ's geographic presence in continental Europe, and we believe the acquisition will generate potential procurement synergies in our Europe segment.

30

On April 21, 2016, we acquired PGW, a leading global distributor and manufacturer of automotive glass products. PGW’s business comprised aftermarket automotive replacement glass distribution services and automotive glass manufacturing. On March 1, 2017, we sold the automotive glass manufacturing component of PGW. Unless otherwise noted, the discussion related to PGW throughout Part II, Item 7 of this annual report on Form 10-K refers to the aftermarket glass distribution operations of PGW, PGW autoglass, which is included within continuing operations. See Note 3, "Discontinued Operations" in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K for further information related to our discontinued operations. The acquisition of PGW autoglass expanded our addressable market in North America. Additionally, we believe the acquisition will create potential distribution synergies with our existing network.
In October 2016, we acquired substantially all of the business assets of Andrew Page Limited ("Andrew Page"), a distributor of aftermarket automotive parts in the United Kingdom. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority ("CMA") concluded its review of this acquisition on October 31, 2017 and determined that we must divest less than 10% of the acquired locations.
In addition to our acquisitions of Rhiag, PGW autoglass, and Andrew Page, we acquired seven wholesale businesses in Europe and five wholesale businesses in North America during the year ended December 31, 2016.
On December 1, 2016, we acquired a 26.5% equity interest in Mekonomen AB ("Mekonomen"), the leading independent car parts and service chain in the Nordic region of Europe, offering a wide range of quality products including spare parts and accessories for cars, and workshop services for consumers and businesses. We are accounting for our interest in Mekonomen using the equity method of accounting, as our investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed 18 acquisitions, including 4 wholesale businesses in North America and 12 wholesale businesses in Europe, a self service retail operation, and a specialty vehicle aftermarket business. Our wholesale business acquisitions in North America included PartsChannel, Inc. (“Parts Channel”), an aftermarket collision parts distributor. The specialty aftermarket business acquired was The Coast Distribution System, Inc. (“Coast”), a supplier of replacement parts, supplies and accessories for the recreational vehicle ("RV") and outdoor recreation markets. Our European acquisitions included 11 aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the Netherlands, 9 of which were former customers of and distributors for our Netherlands subsidiary, Sator, and were acquired with the objective of expanding our distribution network in the Netherlands. Our other acquisitions completed in 2015 enabled us to expand our geographic presence.
See Note 2, "Business Combinations" to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our acquisitions.
Sources of Revenue
We report our revenue in two categories: (i) parts and services and (ii) other. Our parts revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle products including (i) aftermarket, other new and refurbished products and (ii) recycled, remanufactured and related products. Our service revenue is generated primarily from the sale of extended warranties, fees for admission to our self service yards, and processing fees related to the secure disposal of vehicles. During the year ended December 31, 2017, parts and services revenue represented approximately 95% of our consolidated revenue.
The majority of our parts and services revenue is generated from the sale of vehicle replacement products to collision and mechanical repair shops. In our North America segment, our vehicle replacement products include sheet metal crash parts such as doors, hoods, and fenders; bumper covers; head and tail lamps; automotive glass products such as windshields; mirrors and grills; wheels; and large mechanical items such as engines and transmissions. In our Europe segment, our products include a wide variety of small mechanical products such as filters, belts and hoses, spark plugs, alternators and water pumps, batteries, suspension and brake parts, clutches, and oil and lubricants. The demand for these products is influenced by several factors, including the number of vehicles in operation, the number of miles being driven, the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents, the age profile of vehicles in accidents, seasonal weather patterns and local weather conditions, and the availability and pricing of new OEM parts. With respect to collision related products, automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process. Accordingly, we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our vehicle replacement products in North America. While they are not our direct customers, we do provide insurance carriers services in an effort to promote the increased usage of alternative replacement products in the repair process. Such services include the review of vehicle repair order estimates, direct quotation services to insurance company adjusters and an aftermarket parts quality and service assurance program. We neither charge a fee to the insurance carriers for these services nor adjust our pricing to our customers when we perform these services for insurance carriers. There is no standard price for many of our vehicle replacement products, but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as new OEM product prices, product availability, quality, demand, the age and mileage of the vehicle from which the part was obtained (in the case of recycled products), competitor pricing and our product cost.

31

Our revenue from aftermarket, other new and refurbished products also includes revenue generated from the sale of specialty aftermarket vehicle equipment and accessories. These products are primarily sold to a large customer base of specialty vehicle retailers and equipment installers, including mostly independent, single-site operators. Specialty vehicle aftermarket products are typically installed on vehicles within the first three years of ownership to enhance functionality, performance or aesthetics. As a result, the demand for these products is influenced by new and used vehicle sales and the overall economic health of vehicle owners, which may be affected by general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. The prices for our specialty vehicle products are based on manufacturers' suggested retail prices, with discounts applied based on prevailing market conditions, customer volumes and promotions that we may offer from time to time.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue from other sources represented approximately 5% of our consolidated sales. These other sources include scrap sales, bulk sales to mechanical manufacturers (including cores) and sales of aluminum ingots and sows from our furnace operations. We derive scrap metal from several sources, including vehicles that have been used in both our wholesale and self service recycling operations and from OEMs and other entities that contract with us for secure disposal of "crush only" vehicles. Other revenue will vary from period to period based on fluctuations in commodity prices and the volume of materials sold.
Cost of Goods Sold
Our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts, freight, and overhead costs related to the purchasing, warehousing and distribution of our inventory, including labor, facility and equipment costs and depreciation. Our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors. Our cost of goods sold for refurbished products includes the price we pay for cores, freight, and costs to refurbish the parts, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our refurbishing operations.
For recycled products, our cost of goods sold includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and, where applicable, auction, towing and storage fees. Prices for salvage vehicles may be impacted by a variety of factors, including the number of buyers competing to purchase the vehicles, the demand and pricing trends for used vehicles, the number of vehicles designated as “total losses” by insurance companies, the production level of new vehicles (which provides the source from which salvage vehicles ultimately come), the age of vehicles at auction and the status of laws regulating bidders or exporters of salvage vehicles. From time to time, we may also adjust our buying strategy to target vehicles with different attributes (for example, age, level of damage, and revenue potential). Due to changes relating to these factors, we have seen the prices we pay for salvage vehicles fluctuate over time. Our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles. Our labor and labor-related costs related to acquisition and dismantling generally account for between 10% and 15% of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle. The acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and, as a result, energy costs are not material.
Included in our cost of goods sold for remanufactured products is the price we pay for cores; freight; and costs to remanufacture the products, including direct and indirect labor, facility and equipment costs, depreciation and other overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.
Some of our salvage mechanical products are sold with a standard six-month warranty against defects. Additionally, some of our remanufactured engines are sold with a standard three-year warranty against defects. We also provide a limited lifetime warranty for certain of our aftermarket products that is supported by certain of the suppliers of those products. We record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claims information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses.
Other revenue is primarily generated from the hulks and unusable parts of the vehicles we acquire for our wholesale and self service recycled product operations, and therefore, the costs of these sales include the proportionate share of the price we pay for the salvage vehicles as well as the applicable auction, storage and towing fees and internal costs to purchase and dismantle the vehicles. Our cost of goods sold for other revenue will fluctuate based on the prices paid for salvage vehicles, which may be impacted by a variety of factors as discussed above.
Expenses
Our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our aftermarket warehouses, salvage yards and self service retail facilities. These costs include personnel expenses such as wages, incentive compensation and employee benefits for plant management and facility and warehouse personnel, as well as rent for our facilities and related utilities, property taxes, and repairs and maintenance. The costs included in facility and warehouse expenses do not relate to inventory processing or conversion activities and, as such, are classified below the gross margin line on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to prepare and deliver our products to our customers. Included in our distribution expense category are personnel costs such as wages, employee benefits and incentive compensation for drivers;

32

third party freight costs; fuel; and expenses related to our delivery and transfer trucks, including vehicle leases, repairs and maintenance, and insurance.
Our selling and marketing expenses primarily include salary, commission and other incentive compensation expenses for sales personnel; advertising, promotion and marketing costs; credit card fees; telephone and other communication expenses; and bad debt expense. Personnel costs account for the vast majority of our selling and marketing expenses. Most of our sales personnel are paid on a commission basis. The number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers’ needs and increase our sales volume. Our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force, develop and implement training programs, and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness.
Our general and administrative expenses primarily include the costs of our corporate offices and field support center, which provide management, treasury, accounting, legal, payroll, business development, human resources and information systems functions. General and administrative expenses include wages, benefits, stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation for corporate, regional and administrative personnel; information systems support and maintenance expenses; and accounting, legal and other professional fees.
Seasonality
Our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors, influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns. During the winter months, we tend to have higher demand for our vehicle replacement products because there are more weather related repairs. Our specialty vehicle operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the first half of the year, when vehicle owners tend to install this equipment. Our aftermarket glass operations typically generate greater revenue and earnings in the second and third quarters, when the demand for automotive replacement glass increases after the winter weather.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, business combinations and goodwill impairment. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize and report revenue from the sale of vehicle products when they are shipped to or picked up by the customers and title has transferred, subject to an allowance for estimated returns, discounts and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information. In instances where a product is returned by a customer, the product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment. We analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates. We use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold. If actual returns and allowances are higher than our historical experience, there would be an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence. In addition, our customers may earn discounts for prompt payment or may earn a discount or rebate upon achievement of sales volumes. We analyze historical and current sales volume activity to estimate and record a liability for any discounts or rebates that we expect customers to earn. Any rebates earned are generally applied as a credit to the customer’s receivable account.
We recognize revenue from the sale of scrap metal, other metals, and cores when title has transferred, which typically occurs upon delivery to the customer.
Inventory Accounting
Salvage and Remanufactured Inventory. Our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle, including auction, towing and storage fees, as well as expenditures for buying and dismantling vehicles. Inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility's inventory at expected selling prices, the assessment of which incorporates the sales probability based on a part's days in stock and historical demand. The average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility's historical profitability for salvage vehicles. Remanufactured inventory cost is based upon the price paid for cores, and also includes expenses incurred for freight, direct manufacturing costs and overhead related to our remanufacturing operations.

33

For all inventory, carrying value is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value and is reduced to reflect current anticipated demand. If actual demand differs from our estimates, additional reductions to inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made.
Business Combinations
We record our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, under which the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. We utilize management estimates and, in some instances, independent third-party valuation firms to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent consideration granted. Such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions, including projections of future events and operating performance.
Goodwill Impairment
We are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually. When testing goodwill for impairment, we are required to evaluate events and circumstances that may affect the performance of the reporting unit and the extent to which the events and circumstances may impact the future cash flows of the reporting unit to determine whether the fair value of the assets exceed the carrying value. If these assumptions or estimates change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill.
We perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter and between annual tests whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist. During 2017, we did not identify any events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts. Therefore, we did not perform any impairment tests other than our annual test in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, we were organized into five reporting units: Wholesale - North America, Europe, Specialty, Self Service and Aviation. Our Aviation reporting unit resulted from an acquisition of a small wholesale business in North America completed in 2017.
Our goodwill would be considered impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The fair value estimates are established using weightings of the results of a discounted cash flow methodology and a comparative market multiples approach. We believe that using two methods to determine fair value limits the chances of an unrepresentative valuation. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $3.5 billion in goodwill subject to future impairment tests. We determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2017 on all five reporting units. We noted that the fair value estimate for the Aviation reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by less than 10%. This result aligns with our expectations as there has not been a significant change in the value of the business since the acquisition date in March 2017 while we continue to execute our business plan. All other reporting units had a fair value estimate which exceeded the carrying value by at least 25%. If we were required to recognize goodwill impairments, we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
Revenue. The following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---------------------------- ------- ------- --------- ----------- - ---------------- --- ------------ --- --- - ---- ---- - ---- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change in Revenue
 2017 2016 Organic Acquisition Foreign Exchange Total Change
Parts & services revenue $ 9,208,634 $ 8,144,645 4.1 % 9.1 % (0.1 )% 13.1 %
Other revenue 528,275 439,386 19.6 % 0.7 % 0.0 % 20.2 %

Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

The change in parts and services revenue of 13.1% represented increases in segment revenue of 6.7% in North America, 24.5% in Europe, and 6.7% in Specialty. The increase in other revenue of 20.2% primarily consisted of an $86 million organic increase in other revenue, which was largely attributable to our North America segment. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the change in revenue by segment during 2017 compared to the prior year.
Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold remained flat at 61.0% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Cost of goods sold decreased 0.3% as a result of our North America segment, primarily related to our salvage operations. Offsetting this decrease were roughly equal increases in cost of goods sold in our Europe and Specialty segments. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
Facility and Warehouse Expenses. As a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses increased to 8.2% in 2017 from 8.0% in 2016, primarily as a result of increased personnel costs in our North America segment.
Distribution Expenses. As a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses increased to 8.1% in 2017 from 8.0% in 2016. The increase reflected a number of individually insignificant fluctuations in distribution expense as a percentage of revenue across all of our segments.

(1) Additional interest primarily related to borrowings used to fund our acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) During the first quarter of 2016, we incurred a $24 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our early payment of Rhiag debt assumed as part of the acquisition, and we incurred a $3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our January 2016 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement. We incurred an immaterial loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our December 2017 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement.

(3) In March 2016, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to acquire a total of €588 million used to fund the purchase price of the Rhiag acquisition. The rates under the foreign currency forwards were favorable to the spot rate on the date the funds were drawn to complete the acquisition, and as a result, these derivatives contracts generated a gain of $18 million.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) In October 2016, we acquired Andrew Page out of receivership. We recorded a gain on bargain purchase of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, as the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased the gain on bargain purchase for this acquisition by $2 million as a result of changes to our estimate of the fair value of net assets acquired. We also recorded a gain on bargain purchase for another acquisition in Europe completed in the second quarter of 2017.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Interest and other income, net was higher in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which had a net $6 million favorable impact compared to the prior year period. This primarily included unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the purchases of inventory in our U.K. operations. Additionally, there was a $4 million gain due to a decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. The remaining change related to miscellaneous other income.

Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes the components of our provision for income taxes for the periods indicated (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- ------- - ------- ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016
Base provision for income taxes $ 266,403 $ 235,355 (1)
Excess tax benefits from stock-based payments (8,000 ) (11,441 ) (2)
U.S. tax reform deferred tax rate adjustment (72,988 ) — (3)
U.S. tax reform transition tax on foreign earnings 50,800 — (4)
Other discrete items (655 ) (3,348 )
Provision for income taxes $ 235,560 $ 220,566

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Excluding the impact of discrete items, our annual effective tax rate has been close to 35% over the prior two years. We are still evaluating the impact of the Tax Act on our future U.S. tax liability, but at this time, we expect that the overall impact of the Tax Act on our effective tax rate will be a decrease in the rate from previous years.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Represents a discrete item for excess tax benefits received upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Represents the provisional estimate of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Act which reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Represents the provisional estimate of the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Act.

For further discussion of the Tax Act, see Note 13, "Income Taxes," included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to our investment in Mekonomen.
Foreign Currency Impact. We translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the pound sterling rate used to translate the 2017 statements of income declined by 4.9%, while both the Canadian dollar rate and euro rate increased by 2.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The translation effect of the change in these currencies against the U.S. dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted in a $0.01 negative effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations relative to the prior year.
Net (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax totaling $7 million, of which $6 million was for the loss on sale of discontinued operations, compared to income from discontinued operations, net of tax totaling $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Discontinued operations for 2017 and 2016 represents the automotive glass manufacturing business of PGW, which we acquired in April 2016 and sold on March 1, 2017.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we allocated a loss of $4 million to the noncontrolling interest of an immaterial subsidiary.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015
Revenue. The following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category (amounts in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---------------------------- ------- ------- --------- ----------- -- ---------------- --- ------------ ---- ---- -- ---- ---- -- ---- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change in Revenue
 2016 2015 Organic Acquisition Foreign Exchange Total Change
Parts & services revenue $ 8,144,645 $ 6,713,951 4.8 % 19.0 % (2.5 )% 21.3 %
Other revenue 439,386 478,682 (11.2 )% 3.1 % (0.2 )% (8.2 )%
Total revenue $ 8,584,031 $ 7,192,633 3.7 % 18.0 % (2.4 )% 19.3 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

The change in parts and services revenue of 21.3% represented increases in segment revenue of 9.9% in North America, 46.4% in Europe and 13.5% in Specialty. The decrease in other revenue of 8.2% primarily consisted of a $53 million organic decline partially offset by $15 million of acquisition related growth. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue change by segment during 2016 compared to the prior year.
Cost of Goods Sold. Our cost of goods sold increased to 61.0% of revenue in 2016 from 60.6% of revenue in 2015. The increase in cost of goods sold reflected a negative effect of 0.6% from our Rhiag acquisition, which has lower gross margins than our prior year consolidated gross margin. In addition, our cost of goods sold increased 0.2% as a result of mix, as we generated a greater proportion of our revenue in our Specialty operations, which has lower gross margins than our prior year consolidated gross margin. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue of 0.5% primarily related to our self service and wholesale operations in our North America segment. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.
Facility and Warehouse Expenses. As a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to 8.0% from 7.7% in the prior year. The change in facility and warehouse expenses reflected (i) a 0.3% increase as a percentage of revenue in our North America operations related to a realignment of plant manager responsibilities, which shifted these expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to facility and warehouse expenses and (ii) a 0.2% increase as a percentage of revenue in our Europe operations for branch openings and the addition of facility costs for the partly operational Tamworth, England distribution center. These negative impacts were partially offset by a decrease of 0.3% from our acquisition of Rhiag, which has lower facility and warehouse expenses as a percentage of revenue than our prior year consolidated facility and warehouse expenses.
Distribution Expenses. As a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses decreased to 8.0% in 2016 from 8.4% in 2015. The decrease in distribution expense reflected a positive impact of 0.4% from our Rhiag acquisition, which has lower distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue than our prior year consolidated distribution expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 remained flat compared to the prior year at 11.5% of revenue. SG&A expenses increased 0.2% as a result of our Rhiag acquisition, which has higher SG&A expenses than our prior year consolidated SG&A expenses. Offsetting this increase was a 0.2% favorable impact from our Specialty operations as a result of a decline in personnel costs from the realization of integration synergies, a decrease in bad debt expense and other individually insignificant decreases across various SG&A expense categories. Within our North America segment, SG&A personnel expenses were flat as a percentage of revenue, as the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to the realignment of plant manager responsibilities discussed above was offset by increases in other personnel expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Restructuring and Acquisition Related Expenses. The following table summarizes restructuring and acquisition related expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):

---------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ ---- ----- ------ ------ ------ --- - ------

 Year Ended December 31,
 2016 2015 Change
Restructuring expenses $ 15,782 (1) $ 13,083 (1) $ 2,699
Acquisition related expenses 21,980 (2) 6,428 (3) 15,552
Total restructuring and acquisition related expenses $ 37,762 $ 19,511 $ 18,251

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Restructuring expenses of $10 million, $3 million, $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the integration of acquired businesses in our Specialty, North America and Europe segments, respectively. Restructuring expenses of $10 million, $2 million, and $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily related to

39

the integration of acquired businesses in our Specialty, North America, and Europe segments, respectively. These integration activities included the closure of duplicate facilities and termination of employees.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflected $11 million and $4 million related to the acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW, respectively. The remaining $7 million of expense was related to other completed acquisitions and acquisitions that were pending as of December 31, 2016.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Acquisition related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $2 million for our acquisitions of 11 aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the Netherlands and $1 million related to our North America and Specialty acquisitions during the year. Acquisition related expenses also included $3 million for acquisitions that were pending as of December 31, 2015.

See Note 5, "Restructuring and Acquisition Related Expenses" to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our restructuring and integration plans.
Depreciation and Amortization. The following table summarizes depreciation and amortization for the periods indicated (in thousands):

----------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- ------ ------ ------- ------ --- ------ ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2016 2015 Change
Depreciation $ 107,945 $ 88,335 $ 19,610 (1)
Amortization 83,488 33,785 49,703 (2)
Total depreciation and amortization $ 191,433 $ 122,120 $ 69,313

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The increase in depreciation expense primarily reflected the depreciation expense for property and equipment related to our acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW of $14 million and $2 million, respectively. The remaining change primarily reflected increased levels of property and equipment to support our organic related growth.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The increase in amortization expense primarily reflected amortization expense for intangible assets related to our acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW of $43 million and $8 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decline in accelerated amortization for intangibles recognized in previous years.

Other Expense, Net. The following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year increase in other expense, net (in thousands):

--------------------------------------------------------- ------- ------ ---

Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 $ 55,597
Increase (decrease) due to:
Interest expense 30,403 (1)
Loss on debt extinguishment 26,650 (2)
Gains on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related (18,342 ) (3)
Gain on bargain purchase (8,207 ) (4)
Interest and other income, net 16
Net increase 30,520
Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 $ 86,117

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Additional interest primarily relates to borrowings used to fund the acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) During the first quarter of 2016, we incurred a $24 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our early payment of Rhiag debt assumed as part of the acquisition, and we incurred a $3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our January 2016 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) In March 2016, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to acquire a total of €588 million used to fund the purchase price of the Rhiag acquisition. The rates under the foreign currency forwards were favorable to the spot rate on the date the funds were drawn to complete the acquisition, and as result, these derivatives contracts generated a gain of $18 million.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) In October 2016, we acquired Andrew Page out of receivership. The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price, resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of $8 million.

Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 33.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The lower effective income tax rate reflects an $11 million discrete item in 2016 for excess tax benefits from stock-based payments related to the early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"). The adoption of ASU 2016-09 reduced the effective tax rate by 1.6% compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting this, our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by an increase in the proportion of earnings generated in the U.S., which had a higher tax rate than our foreign operations, as well as an increase in nondeductible acquisition related costs, primarily related to our Rhiag and PGW acquisitions as well as other potential acquisitions.
Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2 million related to our equity method investments; no tax benefit was recognized related to these charges. Our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments totaled $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. With our divestiture of ACM Parts in February 2016, our share of net operating losses in our equity method investments was nominal for the year ended December 31, 2016. We are reporting our equity in earnings of our investment in Mekonomen on a one quarter lag and therefore, no amounts were recorded for this investment during 2016.
Foreign Currency Impact. We translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. Relative to the average rates used in 2015, the pound sterling and Canadian dollar rates used to translate the 2016 statements of income declined by 11.3% and 3.5%, respectively; the Euro remained flat relative to the U.S dollar during 2016. The translation effect of the decline in the pound sterling and Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses during 2016 resulted in an approximately $0.05 negative effect on diluted earnings per share for continuing operations relative to the prior year.
Net (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax totaled $8 million in 2016; we had no discontinued operations in the prior year. Discontinued operations for 2016 represents the glass manufacturing business of PGW, which was acquired in April 2016. The results include a $20 million, net of tax, impairment charge primarily related to property, plant and equipment that was triggered when the assets were classified as held for sale.

Results of Operations—Segment Reporting
We have four operating segments: Wholesale – North America, Europe, Specialty and Self Service. Our Wholesale – North America and Self Service operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment, North America, because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services, customers, and methods of distribution. Therefore, we present three reportable segments: North America, Europe and Specialty.
We have presented the growth of our revenue and profitability in our operations on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth and profitability, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance. Constant currency revenue and Segment EBITDA results are calculated by translating prior year revenue and Segment EBITDA in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP financial measure has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. In addition, not all companies that report revenue or profitability on a constant currency basis calculate such measures in the same manner as we do, and accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) In the first quarter of 2017, we realigned a portion of our North America operations under our Specialty segment. Prior year results have been recast to reflect the shift in reporting structure in order to present segment results on a comparable basis.

The key measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, is Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate general and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue. We calculate Segment EBITDA as EBITDA excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other acquisition related gains and losses and equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. EBITDA, which is the basis for Segment EBITDA, is calculated as net income excluding noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest (which includes loss on debt extinguishment) and income tax expense. See Note 14, "Segment and Geographic Information" to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of total Segment EBITDA to net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
North America
Third Party Revenue. The following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our North America segment (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---------------------------- ------- ------- --------- --------------- - ---------------- - ------------ --- --- --- --- --- ---- --- --- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change in Revenue
North America 2017 2016 Organic Acquisition (3) Foreign Exchange Total Change
Parts & services revenue $ 4,278,531 $ 4,009,129 3.0 % (1 ) 3.6 % 0.1 % 6.7 %
Other revenue 520,370 434,757 19.3 % (2 ) 0.4 % 0.0 % 19.7 %
Total third party revenue $ 4,798,901 $ 4,443,886 4.6 % 3.2 % 0.1 % 8.0 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Organic growth in parts and services revenue was largely attributable to increased sales volumes in our wholesale operations, primarily in our salvage operations and, to a lesser extent, our aftermarket operations. Within our salvage

42

operations, the favorable volume impact, which was primarily related to mechanical parts, was a result of refinements to our buying algorithms. Also, an emphasis on inventorying more parts off of each car purchased contributed to the increase in the number of parts sold per vehicle. While we were able to increase parts and services revenue over the prior year, we believe the weather conditions in 2017 contributed to a lower growth rate than generated in prior years. Organic revenue growth for our North America segment was also negatively affected by one fewer selling day in 2017 compared to 2016; on a per day basis, organic revenue growth was 3.4%.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The $86 million increase in other revenue primarily related to (i) a $57 million increase in revenue from scrap steel and other metals primarily related to higher prices and, to a lesser extent, increased volumes, year over year and (ii) a $25 million increase in revenue from metals found in catalytic converters (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) primarily due to higher prices, year over year.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Acquisition related growth in 2017 included $92 million, or 2.1%, from our PGW autoglass acquisition. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth reflected revenue from our acquisition of 11 wholesale businesses from the beginning of 2016 up to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition dates.

 Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $65 million, or 11.1%, in 2017 compared to the prior year. Sequential increases in scrap steel prices in our salvage and self service operations benefited gross margins and had a favorable impact of $12 million on North America Segment EBITDA and approximately a $0.03 positive effect on diluted earnings per share. This favorable impact resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle, which influences the price we pay for a vehicle, and the date we scrapped a vehicle, which influences the price we receive for scrapping a vehicle.
The following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our North America segment:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- -- ---

North America Percentage of Total Segment Revenue
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 13.3 %
Increase (decrease) due to:
Change in gross margin 0.6 % (1)
Change in segment operating expenses (0.3 )% (2)
Change in other expense, net 0.1 %
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 13.7 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The improvement in gross margin reflected a 1.1% favorable impact in our salvage operations, primarily attributable to raising revenue per car by a greater rate than car costs. Revenue per car improved due to higher volumes of parts sold per car, which was a result of refinements to our buying algorithms, an emphasis on inventorying more parts off of each car purchased, and an increase in the number of days we hold each car before it is scrapped. This improvement was partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 0.4% attributable to our aftermarket operations. Within our aftermarket operations, we experienced a 0.4% decline in gross margin primarily as a result of higher input costs from suppliers as well as decreases in net prices caused by higher customer discounts. The remaining change in gross margin was attributable to individually insignificant fluctuations in gross margin across our other North America operations.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflected (i) a 0.3% increase in personnel costs, primarily related to facility and warehouse and SG&A and (ii) a 0.2% increase in freight costs driven by higher use of third party freight to handle increased volumes, partially offset by (iii) a 0.2% decrease in segment operating costs attributable to shared PGW corporate expenses incurred during 2016; these costs, which were primarily SG&A costs, ceased being incurred upon the closing of the sale of the glass manufacturing business on March 1, 2017.

Europe
Third Party Revenue. The following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our Europe segment (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---------------------------- ----- ----------- --------- --------------- - -------------------- ---- ------------ ---- ---- -- ---- ---- - ---- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change in Revenue
Europe 2017 2016 Organic (1) Acquisition (2) Foreign Exchange (3) Total Change
Parts & services revenue $ 3,628,906 $ 2,915,841 5.3 % 19.8 % (0.6 )% 24.5 %
Other revenue 7,905 4,629 47.6 % 24.8 % (1.6 )% 70.8 %
Total third party revenue $ 3,636,811 $ 2,920,470 5.3 % 19.8 % (0.6 )% 24.5 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Parts and services revenue grew organically across all of our aftermarket business units in Europe from both existing locations and new branches. In Eastern Europe and Western Europe, we added 65 and 23 branches, respectively, since the beginning of the prior year, and organic revenue growth includes revenue from those locations. Revenue at our existing locations grew primarily as a result of increased volumes and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Organic revenue growth for our Europe segment on a per day basis was 5.7% as there was one fewer selling day in 2017 compared to 2016.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related growth for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $216 million, or 7.4%, from our acquisition of Rhiag and $141 million, or 4.8%, from our acquisition of Andrew Page. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth included revenue from our acquisitions of 23 wholesale businesses in our Europe segment since the beginning of 2016 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisitions.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $18 million, or 0.6%, primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar against the pound sterling during 2017 relative to 2016, partially offset by the weaker U.S. dollar against the euro during 2017 relative to 2016.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $36 million, or 12.5%, in 2017 compared to the prior year. Our Europe Segment EBITDA included a negative year over year impact of $3 million related to the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars at lower exchange rates than those experienced during 2016. On a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding the translation impact), Segment EBITDA increased by $39 million, or 13.7%, compared to the prior year. Refer to the Foreign Currency Impact discussion within the Results of Operations - Consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Europe segment:

(1) The decline in gross margin was due to (i) a 0.6% decrease due to our U.K. operations primarily as a result of an increase in inventory reserves and incremental costs related to the Tamworth distribution facility, which shifted from operating expenses to cost of goods sold when the facility went live, (ii) a 0.3% decrease due to an unfavorable mix impact as a result of generating a higher proportion of our revenue from our Rhiag operations, which have lower gross margins than our other Europe operations, (iii) a 0.3% decrease due to an acquisition in Eastern Europe during the year which has lower gross margins than our other Europe operations, partially offset by (iv) a 0.6% increase in gross margin in our Benelux operations primarily due to increased private label sales, which have higher gross margins, and (v) a 0.2% increase due to a favorable impact related to an increase in supplier rebates as a result of centralized procurement for our Europe segment. The remaining change in gross margin was attributable to individually

insignificant fluctuations in gross margin across our other Europe operations.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflected (i) an increase of 0.8% in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of Andrew Page, which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other Europe operations and (ii) an increase of 0.4% in operating expenses in our Benelux operations, primarily due to increased personnel costs related to distribution, partially offset by (iii) a 0.2% favorable mix impact due to our acquisition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other Europe operations. The remaining decrease in segment operating expenses reflected a number of individually insignificant fluctuations in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Approximately half of the decrease in other expense, net was due to the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily due to unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the purchases of inventory in our U.K. operations, which were favorable in 2017 relative to the prior year. The remaining decrease in other expense, net reflected a number of individually insignificant fluctuations in other expense, net as a percentage of revenue.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Organic growth in parts & services revenue was driven by increased sales volumes of Truck, Towing and RV parts sales. This organic growth was fueled by favorable economic conditions in most of our primary selling regions, as well as increased sales volumes of light trucks and RVs. Organic revenue growth for our Specialty segment on a per day basis was 5.1%, as there was one fewer selling day in 2017 compared to 2016.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related growth in 2017 included $20 million, or 1.7%, from our acquisition of Warn. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth reflected revenue from our acquisition of 3 wholesale businesses from the beginning of 2016 up to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition dates.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $11 million, or 8.2%, in 2017 compared to the prior year.
The following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Specialty segment:

Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The decline in gross margin primarily reflected a 0.5% decrease due to higher overhead costs in inventory, which is driven by warehouse costs for two new distribution centers that became fully functional in 2016.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The decrease in segment operating expenses reflected (i) favorable facility and warehouse expenses of 0.7% primarily related to the integration of Coast facilities and (ii) favorable personnel costs of 0.2% in SG&A as a result of synergies realized on the integration of Coast facilities.

(1) Organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily attributable to favorable pricing. Increased pricing in our wholesale operations, primarily in our salvage operations, was a result of shifting our salvage vehicle purchasing to higher quality vehicles, which raised the average revenue per part sold. Organic revenue also grew due to increased sales volumes in our wholesale operations resulting from improved fill rates and in-stock rates, as well as increased purchasing levels, which contributed to a greater volume of parts available for sale. The organic growth was partially offset by a negative mix impact as we saw a smaller percentage of sales from high value salvage part types in 2016. Organic revenue growth in parts and services was also negatively affected by milder winter weather conditions in North America in the first quarter of 2016, which we believe impacted volume for the rest of the year.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The $40 million decrease in other revenue primarily relates to (i) a $21 million decline in revenue from metals, such as those found in catalytic converters (platinum, palladium, and rhodium), aluminum wheels, and copper wiring, due to lower prices year over year, (ii) a $13 million reduction due to the sale of our precious metals business late in the second quarter of 2015, and (iii) an $8 million decline in revenue from scrap steel and other metals primarily related to lower prices.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Acquisition related growth in 2016 includes $209 million from our acquisition of PGW autoglass. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth reflects revenue from our acquisition of nine wholesale businesses and a self service retail operation from the beginning of 2015 up to the one year anniversary of the acquisition dates.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by 0.2%, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the prior year.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $49 million, or 9.1%, in 2016 compared to the prior year. While other revenue decreased from the prior year, sequential increases in scrap steel prices in our salvage and self service operations benefited gross margins and had a favorable impact of $8 million on North America Segment EBITDA and approximately a $0.02 positive effect on diluted earnings per share. This favorable impact resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased the car, which influences the price we pay for the car, and the date we scrapped the car, which influences the price we receive for scrapping the vehicle.

(1) The improvement in gross margin reflects a 0.8% favorable impact from our self service operations, as car costs decreased by a greater percentage year over year than revenue. Within our wholesale operations, we experienced a 0.5% favorable impact on gross margin as a result of procurement initiatives implemented in our aftermarket operations during 2016, which reduced our product costs. Partially offsetting these increases was an unfavorable impact of 0.4% related to our acquisition of PGW autoglass, which had lower gross margins than our existing North America operations as a result of a non-recurring inventory step-up adjustment recorded upon acquisition and higher cost products sourced from the glass manufacturing side of the business.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects (i) an increase in operating expenses of 0.4% related to our PGW autoglass acquisition, which had higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our existing North America operations as a result of incremental costs related to shared PGW corporate expenses that did not reoccur after the sale of the PGW glass manufacturing business, and (ii) a 0.3% increase in personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. These increases were partially offset by a 0.2% improvement in fuel prices as a percentage of revenue.

(1) In our U.K. operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 8.1%, while in Benelux region operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 4.5%. Our organic revenue growth in the U.K., which resulted from higher sales volumes, was composed of a 6.6% increase in revenue from stores open more than 12 months and a 1.5% increase in revenue generated by 21 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year through the one-year anniversary of their respective opening dates. Organic revenue growth in our Benelux region was primarily due to a favorable mix impact resulting from a shift in sales to higher price products as well as increased prices; organic revenue also grew as a result of an additional selling day in 2016 compared to the prior year.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related growth for the year-ended December 31, 2016 includes $848 million from our acquisition of Rhiag. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth includes revenue from our acquisitions of 14 distribution companies in the Netherlands, 3 wholesale businesses in our U.K. operations, and 3 salvage businesses in Sweden since the beginning of 2015 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisitions.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $158 million, or 7.9%, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling relative to 2015.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $83 million, or 41.4%, in 2016 compared to the prior year. Our Rhiag acquisition contributed $94 million to Segment EBITDA in 2016, while our Andrew Page acquisition generated a loss of $5 million. Our Europe Segment EBITDA includes a negative year over year impact of $18 million related to the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars at lower exchange rates than those experienced during 2015. On a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding the translation impact), Segment EBITDA increased by $101 million, or 50.2%, compared to the prior year. Refer to the Foreign Currency Impact discussion within the Results of Operations - Consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended December 31, 2016.

(2) The decrease in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects (i) a decrease of 1.8% in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other Europe operations and (ii) a 0.3% decrease in distribution expenses in our U.K. operations due to reduced personnel costs. Partially offsetting these decreases were (i) an increase in facility and warehouse expenses of 0.8% from a 0.5% increase primarily related to the opening of 21 new branches and 6 new hubs since the prior year and 0.3% related to the addition of facility and personnel costs for the Tamworth distribution facility, and (ii) an increase of 0.3% in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of Andrew Page, which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other Europe operations. While we had closed the Andrew Page acquisition and were consolidating its results, we were not permitted to integrate this acquisition with our existing U.K. operations until we received approval from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, which concluded its approval process in October 2017.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Organic growth in Specialty parts and services revenue reflects an increase in service levels throughout North America as we continued to expand the breadth and depth of our inventory offerings and added delivery capacity to our integrated distribution network to allow us to realize synergies associated with the integration of Coast. Through most of 2016, we also saw growth from favorable macro trends and economic conditions, which increased consumer discretionary spending on automotive and recreational vehicle parts and accessories.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related growth reflects the impact of the Coast acquisition on August 19, 2015 through the one year anniversary of the acquisition.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $3 million, or 0.3%, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S dollar against the Canadian dollar relative to 2015.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $18 million, or 16.0%, in 2016 compared to the prior year.
The following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Specialty segment:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- -- ---

Specialty Percentage of Total Segment Revenue
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 10.5 %
(Decrease) increase due to:
Change in gross margin (0.8 )% (1)
Change in segment operating expenses 1.0 % (2)
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 10.7 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The decline in gross margin reflects (i) a 0.4% unfavorable impact due to customer volume rebates which have increased along with sales volume, (ii) a 0.3% increase in inventory costs, which were higher due to the stocking of two distribution centers, one of which was not yet operational in the prior year period and one which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2015, and (iii) a decrease in advertising credits of 0.3% due to higher purchase volume in 2015 from the initial stocking of those two new distribution centers. These negative effects were partially offset by a 0.4% improvement due to Coast related freight synergies as more volume went through the existing Specialty network.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The decrease in segment operating expenses reflects a favorable 0.9% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to (i) a 0.3% decline in personnel costs from the realization of integration synergies, (ii) lower bad debt expense of 0.2% due to increased collection efforts and (iii) individually insignificant decreases across various selling, general and administrative expense categories totaling 0.4%. Favorable distribution expenses of 0.2% due to lower fuel and freight costs were offset by an increase in facilities and warehouse expense primarily related to the higher cost of Coast facilities as well as the addition of two new distribution centers.

(2) Debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs of $3 million and $2 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively).

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Capacity under credit facilities includes our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility. Availability under credit facilities is reduced by our letters of credit.

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities. We utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt. As we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities. To fund our acquisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt financing, including revolving credit facilities, senior notes, and a receivables securitization facility.
As of December 31, 2017, we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Senior secured credit facilities maturing in January 2023, composed of term loans totaling $750 million ($705 million outstanding at December 31, 2017) and $2.75 billion in revolving credit ($1.3 billion outstanding at December 31, 2017), bearing interest at variable rates (although a portion of this debt is hedged through interest rate swap contracts), reduced by $71 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• U.S. Notes (2023) totaling $600 million, maturing in May 2023 and bearing interest at a 4.75% fixed rate

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Euro Notes (2024) totaling $600 million (€500 million), maturing in April 2024 and bearing interest at a 3.875% fixed rate

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Receivables securitization facility with availability up to $100 million ($100 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017), maturing in November 2019 and bearing interest at variable commercial paper rates

From time to time, we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity, such as our December 2017 and January 2016 amendments to our senior secured credit facilities, the issuance of €500 million of Euro Notes (2024) in April 2016, and the November 2016 amendment to our receivables securitization facility. Our financing structure, which includes our senior secured credit facilities, senior notes, and receivables securitization facility, provides financial flexibility to execute our long-term growth strategy. If we see an attractive acquisition opportunity, we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our then-available liquidity.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.4 billion available under our credit facilities. Combined with approximately $280 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.7 billion in available liquidity, an increase of $428 million over our available liquidity as of December 31, 2016. The increase in available liquidity in 2017 is primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of the glass manufacturing business in March for $301 million and the December 2017 amendment to the credit facility, which increased availability by $300 million.
In December 2017, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Stahlgruber for an enterprise value of €1.5 billion. We intend to finance the acquisition with the proceeds from planned debt offerings, borrowings under our existing revolving credit

50

facility and the direct issuance to Stahlgruber's owner of 8,055,569 newly issued shares of LKQ common stock. The timing of the borrowings and the amounts to be drawn from debt offerings and the revolver are to be determined and will depend on the timing of the expected closing of the transaction and market conditions at such time.
We believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements, although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size. While we believe that we have adequate capacity, from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements, as noted above regarding the pending Stahlgruber transaction. There can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our credit facilities, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. Our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at variable rates which are tied to the London InterBank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate ("CDOR"), depending on the currency and the duration of the borrowing, plus an applicable margin rate which is subject to change quarterly based on our reported leverage ratio. We hold interest rate swaps to hedge the variable rates on a portion of our credit agreement borrowings, with the effect of fixing the interest rates on the respective notional amounts. In addition, in 2016, we entered into cross currency swaps that contain an interest rate swap component and a foreign currency forward contract component that, when combined with related intercompany financing arrangements, effectively convert variable rate U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings into fixed rate euro-denominated borrowings. These derivative transactions are described in Note 10, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. After giving effect to these contracts, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at December 31, 2017 was 2.2%. Including our senior notes and the borrowings on our receivables securitization program, our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 3.0% at December 31, 2017.
Cash interest payments were $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including $50 million in semi-annual interest payments as a result of our U.S. Notes (2023) and our Euro Notes (2024). Interest payments on our U.S. Notes (2023) are made in May and November, and interest payments on our Euro Notes (2024) are scheduled for April and October.
We had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Of these amounts, $18 million and $37 million was classified as current maturities at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The scheduled maturities of long-term obligations outstanding at December 31, 2017 are as follows (in thousands):

(1) The total debt amounts presented above reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs of $24 million as of December 31, 2017).

Our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions. The credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants, including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of December 31, 2017.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $280 million, of which $220 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. In general it has been our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and that position has not changed following the enactment of the Tax Act and the related imposition of the transition tax. Beginning in 2018, distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries will be generally exempt from further U.S. taxation, either as a result of the new 100% participation exemption under the Tax Act, or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax. We are still evaluating whether the Tax Act will affect the Company’s existing policy to indefinitely reinvest unremitted foreign earnings.

     We believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the U.S. without resorting to repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, we expect to have significantly lower income tax payments in 2018 due to the lower tax rate and the immediate deduction of capital expenditures, partially offset by the first payment with respect to the transition tax.
Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
The procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. We normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. We normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles.
The following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket and manufactured inventory procurement for 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- --------- ------ --------- ------- --- ------- ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 Change
North America $ 1,367,600 $ 1,198,556 $ 169,044 (1)
Europe 2,355,300 2,012,804 342,496 (2)
Specialty 1,006,600 934,119 72,481 (3)
Total $ 4,729,500 $ 4,145,479 $ 584,021

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) In North America, aftermarket purchases during the year ended December 31, 2017 increased compared to the prior year as we decided to expand our inventory as a result of procurement initiatives to support growth across our operations. The remaining increase is primarily as a result of our acquisition of PGW autoglass in April 2016, which added incremental purchases of $72 million in 2017.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) In our Europe segment, the increase in purchases during the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily related to our acquisition of Rhiag in March 2016, which added incremental purchases of $181 million in 2017. Purchases for our U.K. operations increased in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of our acquisition of Andrew Page in October 2016, which added incremental purchases of $107 million in 2017, partially offset by the devaluation of the pound sterling in 2017 compared to the prior year. Purchases for our Benelux operations increased by $71 million in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of our acquisition of the aftermarket parts distribution businesses in Belgium in July 2017, which had purchases of $46 million in 2017. The remaining increase in our Benelux operations was primarily due to incremental inventory purchases to achieve supplier purchase rebates.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) The increase in Specialty inventory purchases during 2017 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased sales volumes for Truck, Towing and RV parts. Additionally, the acquisition of Warn in November 2017 added incremental purchases of $11 million, which includes purchases of aftermarket inventory and raw materials used in the manufacturing of specialty products.

The following table sets forth a summary of our global salvage and self service procurement for 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

----------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- --- -------- --- - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 % Change
North America wholesale salvage cars and trucks 310 291 6.5 % (1)
Europe wholesale salvage cars and trucks 25 23 8.7 %
Self service and "crush only" cars 542 524 3.4 % (2)

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The number of salvage cars and trucks purchased during the year ended December 31, 2017 increased primarily due to a decision to increase the number of salvage cars and trucks dismantled compared to the prior year.

(2) With the increase in scrap prices compared to the prior year period, we have increased the number of self service and "crush only" vehicles purchased.

The following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year decrease in cash provided by operating activities (in millions):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---- --- ---

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 $ 635
Increase (decrease) due to: (1)
Discontinued operations (68 ) (2)
Operating income 84 (3)
Non-cash depreciation and amortization expense 32 (4)
Cash paid for taxes (43 ) (5)
Cash paid for interest (10 ) (6)
Working capital accounts: (7)
Inventory (133 ) (8)
Accounts payable 8
Accounts receivable 27
Other operating activities (13 ) (9)
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 $ 519

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Other than discontinued operations, the amounts presented represent increases (decreases) in operating cash flows attributable to our continuing operations only.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Represents the change in cash flows for our glass manufacturing business, which was acquired in April 2016 and disposed of on March 1, 2017.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) During 2017, our operating income increased compared to the prior year due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Non-cash depreciation and amortization expense increased compared to the prior year as discussed in the Results of Operations - Consolidated section.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Cash paid for taxes increased during 2017 compared to the prior year as a result of growth in the business from both organic growth and acquisitions, and the timing of tax payments.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) Cash paid for interest increased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of interest payments related to our Euro Notes (2024), which were issued in April 2016. In the prior year, we made one semi-annual interest payment related to these notes, whereas in 2017 we made two semi-annual interest payments.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) Cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control. However, we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we expect to grow our business each year.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(8) The period over period increase in cash outflows for inventory was primarily related to our North America segment as described in the procurement section above.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(9) Reflects a number of individually insignificant fluctuations in cash paid for other operating activities.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $385 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.7 billion in 2016. We invested $513 million of cash, net of cash acquired, in business acquisitions during 2017 compared to $1.3 billion in 2016, which included $601 million for our Rhiag acquisition and $662 million for our PGW acquisition. We received proceeds from the sale of our glass manufacturing business totaling $301 million in 2017; no such proceeds were received in 2016. We paid $8 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2017, compared to cash payments of $186 million in 2016, primarily related to our investment in Mekonomen. In 2016, we entered into foreign currency contracts to fund the purchase price of the Rhiag acquisition, which generated $18 million of cash proceeds; we had no such contracts in the current year period. Property, plant and equipment purchases were $179 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $207 million in the prior year. The period over period decrease in cash outflows for purchases of property, plant and equipment was primarily related to our discontinued operations (down $21 million compared to the prior year), Europe and Specialty segments, partially offset by an increase in our North America segment.

53

Net cash used in financing activities totaled $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.2 billion provided by financing activities during 2016. During 2017, net repayments under our credit facilities totaled $135 million, as we used the proceeds from the sale of our glass manufacturing business and cash flows from operations to repay outstanding revolver borrowings; during 2016, we had net borrowings of $1.3 billion primarily to fund our acquisitions. In April 2016, we issued the Euro Notes (2024) generating proceeds of $563 million. The proceeds from the Euro Notes (2024) were used to repay a portion of the borrowings on the revolving credit facility. Additionally, we repaid $543 million of Rhiag acquired debt and debt related liabilities during 2016. In connection with our December 2017 amendment of our credit facilities, we paid $4 million of debt issuance costs; in 2016, we paid $17 million of debt issuance costs related to our January and December 2016 amendments of our credit facilities, our April 2016 issuance of the Euro Notes (2024), and our November 2016 amendment to our receivables securitization facility. There were $18 million of cash proceeds from other debt in 2017, compared to $33 million in 2016. Cash provided by other financing activities totaled $7 million in 2017, primarily as a result of proceeds from the sale of noncontrolling interest; no such activity occurred in 2016.
We intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of distribution centers, processing and sales facilities, and warehouses, through further integration of our facilities, and through selected business acquisitions. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts, the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015
The following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket inventory procurement for 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- --------- ------ --------- ------- --- --------- ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2016 2015 Change
North America $ 1,198,556 $ 1,023,400 $ 175,156 (1)
Europe 2,012,804 1,143,668 869,136 (2)
Specialty 934,119 776,611 157,508 (3)
Total $ 4,145,479 $ 2,943,679 $ 1,201,800

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) In North America, aftermarket purchases for the year increased primarily as a result of incremental purchases of $141 million related to our April 2016 acquisition of PGW autoglass. Additionally, North America aftermarket inventory purchases increased as a result of our July 2015 acquisition of Parts Channel coupled with lower purchase levels in the first quarter of 2015 due to accelerated purchases in the fourth quarter of 2014 in anticipation of potential labor issues at West Coast ports in the United States.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) In our Europe segment, the increase in purchases was primarily due to our acquisition of Rhiag in March 2016, which added incremental purchases of $710 million during 2016. Purchases for our U.K. operations increased in 2016 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of 21 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year and incremental inventory purchases to stock the Tamworth, England national distribution center. Purchases in our Netherlands operations increased as a result of organic and acquisition related growth. These increases were partially offset by the devaluation of the pound sterling in 2016 compared to the prior year.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) The increase in Specialty aftermarket purchases was primarily due to (i) accelerated inventory purchases to stock two new distribution centers during the first quarter of 2016, (ii) additional purchases to support the increased sales volume as a result of the Coast acquisition, and (iii) additional inventory purchases in 2016 due to stronger than anticipated sales volumes as a result of our annual trade shows.

Manufacturing inventory purchases related to our discontinued operations totaled $398 million during 2016, and consisted of raw materials used in PGW's manufacturing and fabrication of automotive glass products.
The following table sets forth a summary of our global salvage and self service procurement for 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):

----------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- --- -------- ---- - ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2016 2015 % Change
North America wholesale salvage cars and trucks 291 290 0.3 %
Europe wholesale salvage cars and trucks 23 20 15.0 %
Self service and "crush only" cars 524 471 11.3 % (1)

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Compared to the prior year, we increased our purchase of lower cost self service and "crush only" cars in 2016 as prices for vehicles came down in certain markets due to the decline in the prices of scrap and other metals, allowing us to purchase higher quality vehicles at favorable prices.

55

The following table summarizes the components of the year-over-year increase in cash provided by operating activities (in millions):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --- --- ---

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 $ 544
Increase (decrease) due to: (1)
Discontinued operations 64 (2)
Income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 28 (3)
Non-cash depreciation and amortization expense 70 (4)
Cash paid for taxes (37 ) (5)
Working capital accounts: (6)
Accounts receivable (80 ) (7)
Inventory 17 (8)
Accounts payable 21 (9)
Other operating activities 8
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 $ 635

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Other than discontinued operations, the amounts presented represent increases (decreases) in operating cash flows attributable to our continuing operations only.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Represents cash flows for our glass manufacturing business, which was acquired in April 2016.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) During 2016, our operating income increased compared to the prior year due to both acquisition related growth and organic growth.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Non-cash depreciation and amortization expense increased compared to the prior year primarily as a result of our Rhiag and PGW acquisitions.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Cash paid for taxes increased during 2016 compared to the prior year as a result of growth in the business, primarily related to our Rhiag acquisition.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) Cash flows related to our primary working capital accounts can be volatile as the purchases, payments and collections can be timed differently from period to period and can be influenced by factors outside of our control. However, we expect that the net change in these working capital items will generally be a cash outflow as we expect to grow our business each year.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) The increase in cash outflows for accounts receivable is primarily related to our U.K. operations as a result of increased sales; the remaining increase primarily related to our Specialty operations, which experienced larger growth in receivables balances during 2016 than the prior year period from organic and acquisition revenue growth.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(8) Compared to the prior year, cash outflows related to inventory declined primarily as a result of our North America and Specialty operations. This was partially offset by inventory growth in our U.K. operations as a result of incremental inventory purchases to stock new branches and the Tamworth, England national distribution center.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(9) Accounts payable represented a $17 million cash inflow in 2016 compared to a $4 million cash outflow in the prior year. The increase is primarily related to a rise in the payables balance in our U.K. operations, partially offset by a decline in the payables balance in our North America and Rhiag operations due to the timing of payments.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $330 million in 2015. We invested $1.3 billion of cash, net of cash acquired, in business acquisitions during 2016, which included $601 million for our Rhiag acquisition and $662 million for our PGW acquisition, compared to $161 million for business acquisitions in 2015. Property and equipment purchases were $207 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $170 million in the prior year. Purchases of property and equipment increased over the prior period primarily as a result of $24 million of purchases in our discontinued operations and a $20 million increase in our North America segment. In 2016, we paid $186 million for investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, primarily related to our investment in Mekonomen; payments for investments in consolidated subsidiaries were $10 million in 2015. In 2016, we entered into foreign currency contracts to fund the purchase price of the Rhiag acquisition, which generated $18 million of gains; we had no such contracts in the prior year. During 2016, cash provided by other investing activities, net was $14 million, primarily from the

56

proceeds on the sale of our interest in our Australian joint venture, compared to $11 million in 2015 primarily as a result of proceeds from disposals of fixed assets.
Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $239 million in 2015. During 2016, net borrowings under our credit facilities were $1.3 billion compared to net repayments of $187 million in 2015. The increase in borrowings during 2016 is primarily the result of borrowings under our multi-currency revolving credit facility in order to fund the acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW and investment in Mekonomen and repay $543 million of Rhiag acquired debt and debt related liabilities. The increase in borrowings during 2016 also reflects our 2016 amendments of our credit facilities, which generated $339 million in additional term loan borrowings, a portion of which was used to repay outstanding revolver borrowings. In April 2016, we issued the Euro Notes (2024), generating proceeds of $563 million. The proceeds from the Euro Notes (2024) were used to repay a portion of the borrowings on the revolving credit facility. In connection with our January and December 2016 amendments of our credit facilities, our April 2016 issuance of the Euro Notes (2024), and our November 2016 amendment to our receivables securitization facility, we paid $17 million of debt issuance costs during 2016; debt issuance costs incurred in the prior year were minimal.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Future Commitments
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or undisclosed borrowings or debt that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Additionally, we do not have any synthetic leases.
The following table represents our future commitments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):

(1) Our long-term debt under contractual obligations above includes interest of $572 million on the balances outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The long-term debt balance excludes debt issuance costs, as these expenses have already been paid. Interest on our senior notes, notes payable, and other long-term debt is calculated based on the respective stated rates. Interest on our variable rate credit facilities is calculated based on the weighted average rates, including the impact of interest rate swaps through their respective expiration dates, in effect for each tranche of borrowings as of December 31, 2017. Future estimated interest expense for the next year, one to three years, and three to five years is $108 million, $210 million and $203 million, respectively. Estimated interest expense beyond five years is $51 million.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Interest on capital lease obligations of $10 million is included based on incremental borrowing or implied rates. Future estimated interest expense for the next year is less than $1 million, while future estimated interest expense for both the next one to three years and three to five years is $1 million. Estimated interest expense beyond five years is $8 million.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) The operating lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Our purchase obligations include open purchase orders for aftermarket inventory.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Our other long-term obligations consist of estimated payments for our self insurance reserves of $87 million, outstanding letters of credit of $71 million, and outstanding estimated payments of $51 million on the repatriation of earnings as a result of the Tax Act, with the remaining $116 million representing primarily other asset purchase commitments and payments for deferred compensation and pension plans.

57

Additionally, in December 2017, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Stahlgruber from Stahlgruber Otto Gruber AG, for an enterprise value of €1.5 billion. We will be required to pay a break fee of approximately €75 million if the acquisition of Stahlgruber is not completed. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2018 and is subject to regulatory approvals. Neither the cash purchase price nor the break fee are included in the table above.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS TubeMogul On December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million of which $745.1 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $204.4 million to identifiable intangible assets and $142.0 million to net liabilities assumed. We also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has n...

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. 90  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 1, 2017 (in thousands): ----------- ------- -------------------- -------------------------- - --------------------------- ----- - ------ Operating Leases Fiscal Year Purchase O...

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. 90  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 1, 2017 (in thousands): ----------- ------- -------------------- -------------------------- - --------------------------- ----- - ------ Operating Leases Fiscal Year Purchase O...

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...

["); new products produced by companies other than the OEMs, which are referred to as aftermarket products; recycled products obtained from salvage vehicles; used products that have been refurbished; and used products that have been remanufactured. We distribute a variety of products to collision and mechanical repair shops, including aftermarket collision and mechanical products; recycled collision and mechanical products; refurbished collision products such as wheels, bumper covers and lights; and remanufactured engines. Collectively, we refer to the four sources that are not new OEM products as alternative parts.
We are a leading provider of alternative vehicle collision replacement products and alternative vehicle mechanical replacement products, with our sales, processing, and distribution facilities reaching most major markets in the United States and Canada. We are also a leading provider of alternative vehicle replacement and maintenance products in Europe. In addition to our wholesale operations, we operate self service retail facilities across the U.S. that sell recycled automotive products from end-of-life-vehicles. We are also a leading distributor of specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories reaching most major markets in the U.S. and Canada.
We are organized into four operating segments: Wholesale – North America; Europe; Specialty and Self Service. We aggregate our Wholesale – North America and Self Service operating segments into one reportable segment, North America, resulting in three reportable segments: North America, Europe and Specialty.
Our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Please refer to the factors discussed in Forward-Looking Statements in Part I, Item 1 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to these factors and others, which may be unknown to us at this time, our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate. Accordingly, our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance.
Acquisitions and Investments
Since our inception in 1998, we have pursued a growth strategy through both organic growth and acquisitions. We have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability, cash flow and stockholder value. We target companies that are market leaders, will expand our geographic presence and will enhance our ability to provide a wide array of vehicle products to our customers through our distribution network.
On July 3, 2017, we acquired four aftermarket parts distribution businesses in Belgium. The objective of these acquisitions is to transform the existing three-step distribution model in Belgium to a two-step distribution model to align with our Netherlands operations.
On November 1, 2017, we acquired Warn Industries, Inc. ("]:

We believe that our current liquidity and cash expected to be generated by operating activities in future periods will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements, although such sources may not be sufficient for future acquisitions depending on their size. While we believe that we have adequate capacity, from time to time we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements, as noted above regarding the pending Stahlgruber transaction. There can be no assurance that additional funding, or refinancing of our credit facilities, if needed, will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. Furthermore, any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants or higher interest costs. Our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.

Note 8. Long-term Debt In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021.

[" to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. After giving effect to these contracts, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement at December 31, 2017 was 2.2%. Including our senior notes and the borrowings on our receivables securitization program, our overall weighted average interest rate on borrowings was 3.0% at December 31, 2017.
Cash interest payments were $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, including $50 million in semi-annual interest payments as a result of our U.S. Notes (2023) and our Euro Notes (2024). Interest payments on our U.S. Notes (2023) are made in May and November, and interest payments on our Euro Notes (2024) are scheduled for April and October.
We had outstanding credit agreement borrowings of $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Of these amounts, $18 million and $37 million was classified as current maturities at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
The scheduled maturities of long-term obligations outstanding at December 31, 2017 are as follows (in thousands):

(1) The total debt amounts presented above reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs of $24 million as of December 31, 2017).

Our credit agreement contains customary covenants that provide limitations and conditions on our ability to enter into certain transactions. The credit agreement also contains financial and affirmative covenants, including limitations on our net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our credit agreement as of December 31, 2017.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $280 million, of which $220 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. In general it has been our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and that position has not changed following the enactment of the Tax Act and the related imposition of the transition tax. Beginning in 2018, distributions of dividends from our foreign subsidiaries will be generally exempt from further U.S. taxation, either as a result of the new 100% participation exemption under the Tax Act, or due to the previous taxation of foreign earnings under the transition tax. We are still evaluating whether the Tax Act will affect the Company’s existing policy to indefinitely reinvest unremitted foreign earnings.

51

     We believe that we have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to meet our financial obligations in the U.S. without resorting to repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, we expect to have significantly lower income tax payments in 2018 due to the lower tax rate and the immediate deduction of capital expenditures, partially offset by the first payment with respect to the transition tax.
Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
The procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds. We normally pay for aftermarket product purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms, depending on the manufacturer and the negotiated payment terms. We normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles.
The following table sets forth a summary of our aftermarket and manufactured inventory procurement for 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):

------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- --------- ------ --------- ------- --- ------- ---

(1) In North America, aftermarket purchases during the year ended December 31, 2017 increased compared to the prior year as we decided to expand our inventory as a result of procurement initiatives to support growth across our operations. The remaining increase is primarily as a result of our acquisition of PGW autoglass in April 2016, which added incremental purchases of $72 million in 2017.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) In our Europe segment, the increase in purchases during the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily related to our acquisition of Rhiag in March 2016, which added incremental purchases of $181 million in 2017. Purchases for our U.K. operations increased in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of our acquisition of Andrew Page in October 2016, which added incremental purchases of $107 million in 2017, partially offset by the devaluation of the pound sterling in 2017 compared to the prior year. Purchases for our Benelux operations increased by $71 million in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of our acquisition of the aftermarket parts distribution businesses in Belgium in July 2017, which had purchases of $46 million in 2017. The remaining increase in our Benelux operations was primarily due to incremental inventory purchases to achieve supplier purchase rebates.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) The increase in Specialty inventory purchases during 2017 compared to the prior year is primarily due to increased sales volumes for Truck, Towing and RV parts. Additionally, the acquisition of Warn in November 2017 added incremental purchases of $11 million, which includes purchases of aftermarket inventory and raw materials used in the manufacturing of specialty products.

In addition, Jefferies initiated a plan to substantially exit the remaining aspects of its futures business, which was completed during the second quarter of 2016. In addition, Jefferies terminated its $750.0 million credit facility on July 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Jefferies recognized costs of $3.8 million related to the Credit Facility.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---------------------------- ------- ------- --------- ----------- - ---------------- --- ------------ --- --- - ---- ---- - ---- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change in Revenue
 2017 2016 Organic Acquisition Foreign Exchange Total Change
Parts & services revenue $ 9,208,634 $ 8,144,645 4.1 % 9.1 % (0.1 )% 13.1 %

Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

The change in parts and services revenue of 13.1% represented increases in segment revenue of 6.7% in North America, 24.5% in Europe, and 6.7% in Specialty. The increase in other revenue of 20.2% primarily consisted of an $86 million organic increase in other revenue, which was largely attributable to our North America segment. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the change in revenue by segment during 2017 compared to the prior year.
Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold remained flat at 61.0% of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Cost of goods sold decreased 0.3% as a result of our North America segment, primarily related to our salvage operations. Offsetting this decrease were roughly equal increases in cost of goods sold in our Europe and Specialty segments. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.
Facility and Warehouse Expenses. As a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses increased to 8.2% in 2017 from 8.0% in 2016, primarily as a result of increased personnel costs in our North America segment.
Distribution Expenses. As a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses increased to 8.1% in 2017 from 8.0% in 2016. The increase reflected a number of individually insignificant fluctuations in distribution expense as a percentage of revenue across all of our segments.

(1) The increase in depreciation expense primarily reflected increases of $4 million and $2 million for property, plant and equipment recorded for our acquisitions of Andrew Page and Rhiag, respectively. Depreciation expense increased in 2017 for Andrew Page and Rhiag primarily due to both acquisitions having a full year of results in 2017 compared to a partial year in 2016 (from acquisition dates of October 4, 2016 and March 18, 2016, respectively, through December 31, 2016). The remaining change primarily reflected increased levels of property, plant and equipment to support our organic related growth.

Loss on debt extinguishment (26,194 ) (2)
Gain on foreign exchange contracts - acquisition related 18,342 (3)
Gains on bargain purchases 4,337 (4)
Interest and other income, net (15,288 ) (5)
Net decrease (5,426 )
Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 $ 80,691

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Additional interest primarily related to borrowings used to fund our acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) During the first quarter of 2016, we incurred a $24 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our early payment of Rhiag debt assumed as part of the acquisition, and we incurred a $3 million loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our January 2016 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement. We incurred an immaterial loss on debt extinguishment as a result of our December 2017 amendment to our senior secured credit agreement.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) In March 2016, we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to acquire a total of €588 million used to fund the purchase price of the Rhiag acquisition. The rates under the foreign currency forwards were favorable to the spot rate on the date the funds were drawn to complete the acquisition, and as a result, these derivatives contracts generated a gain of $18 million.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) In October 2016, we acquired Andrew Page out of receivership. We recorded a gain on bargain purchase of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, as the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased the gain on bargain purchase for this acquisition by $2 million as a result of changes to our estimate of the fair value of net assets acquired. We also recorded a gain on bargain purchase for another acquisition in Europe completed in the second quarter of 2017.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Interest and other income, net was higher in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which had a net $6 million favorable impact compared to the prior year period. This primarily included unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the purchases of inventory in our U.K. operations. Additionally, there was a $4 million gain due to a decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. The remaining change related to miscellaneous other income.

Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 32.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes the components of our provision for income taxes for the periods indicated (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- ------- - ------- ---

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016
Base provision for income taxes $ 266,403 $ 235,355 (1)
Excess tax benefits from stock-based payments (8,000 ) (11,441 ) (2)
U.S. tax reform deferred tax rate adjustment (72,988 ) — (3)
U.S. tax reform transition tax on foreign earnings 50,800 — (4)
Other discrete items (655 ) (3,348 )
Provision for income taxes $ 235,560 $ 220,566

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Excluding the impact of discrete items, our annual effective tax rate has been close to 35% over the prior two years. We are still evaluating the impact of the Tax Act on our future U.S. tax liability, but at this time, we expect that the overall impact of the Tax Act on our effective tax rate will be a decrease in the rate from previous years.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Represents a discrete item for excess tax benefits received upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Represents the provisional estimate of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Act which reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Represents the provisional estimate of the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Act.

Note 8. Long-term Debt In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under the facility. ------- -----------------------------

[" included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to our investment in Mekonomen.
Foreign Currency Impact. We translate our statements of income at the average exchange rates in effect for the period. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the pound sterling rate used to translate the 2017 statements of income declined by 4.9%, while both the Canadian dollar rate and euro rate increased by 2.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The translation effect of the change in these currencies against the U.S. dollar and realized and unrealized currency losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted in a $0.01 negative effect on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations relative to the prior year.
Net (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we recorded a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax totaling $7 million, of which $6 million was for the loss on sale of discontinued operations, compared to income from discontinued operations, net of tax totaling $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Discontinued operations for 2017 and 2016 represents the automotive glass manufacturing business of PGW, which we acquired in April 2016 and sold on March 1, 2017.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we allocated a loss of $4 million to the noncontrolling interest of an immaterial subsidiary.

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015
Revenue. The following table summarizes the changes in revenue by category (amounts in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---------------------------- ------- ------- --------- ----------- -- ---------------- --- ------------ ---- ---- -- ---- ---- -- ---- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change in Revenue
 2016 2015 Organic Acquisition Foreign Exchange Total Change
Parts & services revenue $ 8,144,645 $ 6,713,951 4.8 % 19.0 % (2.5 )% 21.3 %
Other revenue 439,386 478,682 (11.2 )% 3.1 % (0.2 )% (8.2 )%
Total revenue $ 8,584,031 $ 7,192,633 3.7 % 18.0 % (2.4 )% 19.3 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

The change in parts and services revenue of 21.3% represented increases in segment revenue of 9.9% in North America, 46.4% in Europe and 13.5% in Specialty. The decrease in other revenue of 8.2% primarily consisted of a $53 million organic decline partially offset by $15 million of acquisition related growth. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to revenue change by segment during 2016 compared to the prior year.
Cost of Goods Sold. Our cost of goods sold increased to 61.0% of revenue in 2016 from 60.6% of revenue in 2015. The increase in cost of goods sold reflected a negative effect of 0.6% from our Rhiag acquisition, which has lower gross margins than our prior year consolidated gross margin. In addition, our cost of goods sold increased 0.2% as a result of mix, as we generated a greater proportion of our revenue in our Specialty operations, which has lower gross margins than our prior year consolidated gross margin. These negative impacts were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue of 0.5% primarily related to our self service and wholesale operations in our North America segment. Refer to the discussion of our segment results of operations for factors contributing to the changes in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue by segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.
Facility and Warehouse Expenses. As a percentage of revenue, facility and warehouse expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to 8.0% from 7.7% in the prior year. The change in facility and warehouse expenses reflected (i) a 0.3% increase as a percentage of revenue in our North America operations related to a realignment of plant manager responsibilities, which shifted these expenses from selling, general and administrative expenses to facility and warehouse expenses and (ii) a 0.2% increase as a percentage of revenue in our Europe operations for branch openings and the addition of facility costs for the partly operational Tamworth, England distribution center. These negative impacts were partially offset by a decrease of 0.3% from our acquisition of Rhiag, which has lower facility and warehouse expenses as a percentage of revenue than our prior year consolidated facility and warehouse expenses.
Distribution Expenses. As a percentage of revenue, distribution expenses decreased to 8.0% in 2016 from 8.4% in 2015. The decrease in distribution expense reflected a positive impact of 0.4% from our Rhiag acquisition, which has lower distribution expenses as a percentage of revenue than our prior year consolidated distribution expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 remained flat compared to the prior year at 11.5% of revenue. SG&A expenses increased 0.2% as a result of our Rhiag acquisition, which has higher SG&A expenses than our prior year consolidated SG&A expenses. Offsetting this increase was a 0.2% favorable impact from our Specialty operations as a result of a decline in personnel costs from the realization of integration synergies, a decrease in bad debt expense and other individually insignificant decreases across various SG&A expense categories. Within our North America segment, SG&A personnel expenses were flat as a percentage of revenue, as the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue related to the realignment of plant manager responsibilities discussed above was offset by increases in other personnel expenses as a percentage of revenue.
Restructuring and Acquisition Related Expenses. The following table summarizes restructuring and acquisition related expenses for the periods indicated (in thousands):

---------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ ---- ----- ------ ------ ------ --- - ------

 Year Ended December 31,
 2016 2015 Change
Restructuring expenses $ 15,782 (1) $ 13,083 (1) $ 2,699
Acquisition related expenses 21,980 (2) 6,428 (3) 15,552
Total restructuring and acquisition related expenses $ 37,762 $ 19,511 $ 18,251

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Restructuring expenses of $10 million, $3 million, $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the integration of acquired businesses in our Specialty, North America and Europe segments, respectively. Restructuring expenses of $10 million, $2 million, and $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily related to

39

the integration of acquired businesses in our Specialty, North America, and Europe segments, respectively. These integration activities included the closure of duplicate facilities and termination of employees.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflected $11 million and $4 million related to the acquisitions of Rhiag and PGW, respectively. The remaining $7 million of expense was related to other completed acquisitions and acquisitions that were pending as of December 31, 2016.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Acquisition related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $2 million for our acquisitions of 11 aftermarket parts distribution businesses in the Netherlands and $1 million related to our North America and Specialty acquisitions during the year. Acquisition related expenses also included $3 million for acquisitions that were pending as of December 31, 2015.

See Note 5, "]:
Note 8. Long-term Debt In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under the facility. ------- -----------------------------

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016
North America
Third Party Revenue. The following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our North America segment (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---------------------------- ------- ------- --------- --------------- - ---------------- - ------------ --- --- --- --- --- ---- --- --- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change in Revenue
North America 2017 2016 Organic Acquisition (3) Foreign Exchange Total Change
Parts & services revenue $ 4,278,531 $ 4,009,129 3.0 % (1 ) 3.6 % 0.1 % 6.7 %
Other revenue 520,370 434,757 19.3 % (2 ) 0.4 % 0.0 % 19.7 %
Total third party revenue $ 4,798,901 $ 4,443,886 4.6 % 3.2 % 0.1 % 8.0 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Organic growth in parts and services revenue was largely attributable to increased sales volumes in our wholesale operations, primarily in our salvage operations and, to a lesser extent, our aftermarket operations. Within our salvage

42

operations, the favorable volume impact, which was primarily related to mechanical parts, was a result of refinements to our buying algorithms. Also, an emphasis on inventorying more parts off of each car purchased contributed to the increase in the number of parts sold per vehicle. While we were able to increase parts and services revenue over the prior year, we believe the weather conditions in 2017 contributed to a lower growth rate than generated in prior years. Organic revenue growth for our North America segment was also negatively affected by one fewer selling day in 2017 compared to 2016; on a per day basis, organic revenue growth was 3.4%.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The $86 million increase in other revenue primarily related to (i) a $57 million increase in revenue from scrap steel and other metals primarily related to higher prices and, to a lesser extent, increased volumes, year over year and (ii) a $25 million increase in revenue from metals found in catalytic converters (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) primarily due to higher prices, year over year.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Acquisition related growth in 2017 included $92 million, or 2.1%, from our PGW autoglass acquisition. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth reflected revenue from our acquisition of 11 wholesale businesses from the beginning of 2016 up to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition dates.

 Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $65 million, or 11.1%, in 2017 compared to the prior year. Sequential increases in scrap steel prices in our salvage and self service operations benefited gross margins and had a favorable impact of $12 million on North America Segment EBITDA and approximately a $0.03 positive effect on diluted earnings per share. This favorable impact resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased a vehicle, which influences the price we pay for a vehicle, and the date we scrapped a vehicle, which influences the price we receive for scrapping a vehicle.
The following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our North America segment:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- -- ---

North America Percentage of Total Segment Revenue
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 13.3 %
Increase (decrease) due to:
Change in gross margin 0.6 % (1)
Change in segment operating expenses (0.3 )% (2)
Change in other expense, net 0.1 %
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 13.7 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The improvement in gross margin reflected a 1.1% favorable impact in our salvage operations, primarily attributable to raising revenue per car by a greater rate than car costs. Revenue per car improved due to higher volumes of parts sold per car, which was a result of refinements to our buying algorithms, an emphasis on inventorying more parts off of each car purchased, and an increase in the number of days we hold each car before it is scrapped. This improvement was partially offset by an unfavorable impact of 0.4% attributable to our aftermarket operations. Within our aftermarket operations, we experienced a 0.4% decline in gross margin primarily as a result of higher input costs from suppliers as well as decreases in net prices caused by higher customer discounts. The remaining change in gross margin was attributable to individually insignificant fluctuations in gross margin across our other North America operations.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflected (i) a 0.3% increase in personnel costs, primarily related to facility and warehouse and SG&A and (ii) a 0.2% increase in freight costs driven by higher use of third party freight to handle increased volumes, partially offset by (iii) a 0.2% decrease in segment operating costs attributable to shared PGW corporate expenses incurred during 2016; these costs, which were primarily SG&A costs, ceased being incurred upon the closing of the sale of the glass manufacturing business on March 1, 2017.

Europe
Third Party Revenue. The following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our Europe segment (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---------------------------- ----- ----------- --------- --------------- - -------------------- ---- ------------ ---- ---- -- ---- ---- - ---- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change in Revenue
Europe 2017 2016 Organic (1) Acquisition (2) Foreign Exchange (3) Total Change
Parts & services revenue $ 3,628,906 $ 2,915,841 5.3 % 19.8 % (0.6 )% 24.5 %
Other revenue 7,905 4,629 47.6 % 24.8 % (1.6 )% 70.8 %
Total third party revenue $ 3,636,811 $ 2,920,470 5.3 % 19.8 % (0.6 )% 24.5 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Parts and services revenue grew organically across all of our aftermarket business units in Europe from both existing locations and new branches. In Eastern Europe and Western Europe, we added 65 and 23 branches, respectively, since the beginning of the prior year, and organic revenue growth includes revenue from those locations. Revenue at our existing locations grew primarily as a result of increased volumes and, to a lesser extent, increased prices. Organic revenue growth for our Europe segment on a per day basis was 5.7% as there was one fewer selling day in 2017 compared to 2016.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related growth for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $216 million, or 7.4%, from our acquisition of Rhiag and $141 million, or 4.8%, from our acquisition of Andrew Page. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth included revenue from our acquisitions of 23 wholesale businesses in our Europe segment since the beginning of 2016 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisitions.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $18 million, or 0.6%, primarily due to the stronger U.S. dollar against the pound sterling during 2017 relative to 2016, partially offset by the weaker U.S. dollar against the euro during 2017 relative to 2016.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $36 million, or 12.5%, in 2017 compared to the prior year. Our Europe Segment EBITDA included a negative year over year impact of $3 million related to the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars at lower exchange rates than those experienced during 2016. On a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding the translation impact), Segment EBITDA increased by $39 million, or 13.7%, compared to the prior year. Refer to the Foreign Currency Impact discussion within the Results of Operations - Consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Europe segment:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- -- ---

Europe Percentage of Total Segment Revenue
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 9.7 %
(Decrease) increase due to:
Change in gross margin (0.4 )% (1)
Change in segment operating expenses (0.8 )% (2)
Change in other expense, net 0.3 % (3)
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 8.8 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The decline in gross margin was due to (i) a 0.6% decrease due to our U.K. operations primarily as a result of an increase in inventory reserves and incremental costs related to the Tamworth distribution facility, which shifted from operating expenses to cost of goods sold when the facility went live, (ii) a 0.3% decrease due to an unfavorable mix impact as a result of generating a higher proportion of our revenue from our Rhiag operations, which have lower gross margins than our other Europe operations, (iii) a 0.3% decrease due to an acquisition in Eastern Europe during the year which has lower gross margins than our other Europe operations, partially offset by (iv) a 0.6% increase in gross margin in our Benelux operations primarily due to increased private label sales, which have higher gross margins, and (v) a 0.2% increase due to a favorable impact related to an increase in supplier rebates as a result of centralized procurement for our Europe segment. The remaining change in gross margin was attributable to individually

44

insignificant fluctuations in gross margin across our other Europe operations.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflected (i) an increase of 0.8% in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of Andrew Page, which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other Europe operations and (ii) an increase of 0.4% in operating expenses in our Benelux operations, primarily due to increased personnel costs related to distribution, partially offset by (iii) a 0.2% favorable mix impact due to our acquisition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other Europe operations. The remaining decrease in segment operating expenses reflected a number of individually insignificant fluctuations in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Approximately half of the decrease in other expense, net was due to the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily due to unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge the purchases of inventory in our U.K. operations, which were favorable in 2017 relative to the prior year. The remaining decrease in other expense, net reflected a number of individually insignificant fluctuations in other expense, net as a percentage of revenue.

Specialty
Third Party Revenue. The following table summarizes the changes in third party revenue by category in our Specialty segment (in thousands):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---------------------------- - ----------- --------- --------------- - ---------------- - ------------ --- - - --- - - --- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percentage Change in Revenue
Specialty 2017 2016 Organic (1) Acquisition (2) Foreign Exchange Total Change
Parts & services revenue $ 1,301,197 $ 1,219,675 4.7 % 1.9 % 0.1 % 6.7 %
Other revenue — — — % — % — % — %
Total third party revenue $ 1,301,197 $ 1,219,675 4.7 % 1.9 % 0.1 % 6.7 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Organic growth in parts & services revenue was driven by increased sales volumes of Truck, Towing and RV parts sales. This organic growth was fueled by favorable economic conditions in most of our primary selling regions, as well as increased sales volumes of light trucks and RVs. Organic revenue growth for our Specialty segment on a per day basis was 5.1%, as there was one fewer selling day in 2017 compared to 2016.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related growth in 2017 included $20 million, or 1.7%, from our acquisition of Warn. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth reflected revenue from our acquisition of 3 wholesale businesses from the beginning of 2016 up to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition dates.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $11 million, or 8.2%, in 2017 compared to the prior year.
The following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Specialty segment:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- -- ---

Specialty Percentage of Total Segment Revenue
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 10.7 %
(Decrease) increase due to:
Change in gross margin (0.5 )% (1)
Change in segment operating expenses 0.8 % (2)
Change in other expense, net (0.1 )%
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 10.9 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The decline in gross margin primarily reflected a 0.5% decrease due to higher overhead costs in inventory, which is driven by warehouse costs for two new distribution centers that became fully functional in 2016.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The decrease in segment operating expenses reflected (i) favorable facility and warehouse expenses of 0.7% primarily related to the integration of Coast facilities and (ii) favorable personnel costs of 0.2% in SG&A as a result of synergies realized on the integration of Coast facilities.

(1) Organic growth in parts and services revenue was primarily attributable to favorable pricing. Increased pricing in our wholesale operations, primarily in our salvage operations, was a result of shifting our salvage vehicle purchasing to higher quality vehicles, which raised the average revenue per part sold. Organic revenue also grew due to increased sales volumes in our wholesale operations resulting from improved fill rates and in-stock rates, as well as increased purchasing levels, which contributed to a greater volume of parts available for sale. The organic growth was partially offset by a negative mix impact as we saw a smaller percentage of sales from high value salvage part types in 2016. Organic revenue growth in parts and services was also negatively affected by milder winter weather conditions in North America in the first quarter of 2016, which we believe impacted volume for the rest of the year.

(2) The $40 million decrease in other revenue primarily relates to (i) a $21 million decline in revenue from metals, such as those found in catalytic converters (platinum, palladium, and rhodium), aluminum wheels, and copper wiring, due to lower prices year over year, (ii) a $13 million reduction due to the sale of our precious metals business late in the second quarter of 2015, and (iii) an $8 million decline in revenue from scrap steel and other metals primarily related to lower prices.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Acquisition related growth in 2016 includes $209 million from our acquisition of PGW autoglass. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth reflects revenue from our acquisition of nine wholesale businesses and a self service retail operation from the beginning of 2015 up to the one year anniversary of the acquisition dates.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by 0.2%, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar compared to the prior year.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $49 million, or 9.1%, in 2016 compared to the prior year. While other revenue decreased from the prior year, sequential increases in scrap steel prices in our salvage and self service operations benefited gross margins and had a favorable impact of $8 million on North America Segment EBITDA and approximately a $0.02 positive effect on diluted earnings per share. This favorable impact resulted from the increase in scrap steel prices between the date we purchased the car, which influences the price we pay for the car, and the date we scrapped the car, which influences the price we receive for scrapping the vehicle.
The following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our North America segment:

(1) The improvement in gross margin reflects a 0.8% favorable impact from our self service operations, as car costs decreased by a greater percentage year over year than revenue. Within our wholesale operations, we experienced a 0.5% favorable impact on gross margin as a result of procurement initiatives implemented in our aftermarket operations during 2016, which reduced our product costs. Partially offsetting these increases was an unfavorable impact of 0.4% related to our acquisition of PGW autoglass, which had lower gross margins than our existing North America operations as a result of a non-recurring inventory step-up adjustment recorded upon acquisition and higher cost products sourced from the glass manufacturing side of the business.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The increase in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects (i) an increase in operating expenses of 0.4% related to our PGW autoglass acquisition, which had higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our existing North America operations as a result of incremental costs related to shared PGW corporate expenses that did not reoccur after the sale of the PGW glass manufacturing business, and (ii) a 0.3% increase in personnel costs as a percentage of revenue. These increases were partially offset by a 0.2% improvement in fuel prices as a percentage of revenue.

(1) In our U.K. operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 8.1%, while in Benelux region operations, parts and services revenue grew organically by 4.5%. Our organic revenue growth in the U.K., which resulted from higher sales volumes, was composed of a 6.6% increase in revenue from stores open more than 12 months and a 1.5% increase in revenue generated by 21 branch openings since the beginning of the prior year through the one-year anniversary of their respective opening dates. Organic revenue growth in our Benelux region was primarily due to a favorable mix impact resulting from a shift in sales to higher price products as well as increased prices; organic revenue also grew as a result of an additional selling day in 2016 compared to the prior year.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related growth for the year-ended December 31, 2016 includes $848 million from our acquisition of Rhiag. The remainder of our acquired revenue growth includes revenue from our acquisitions of 14 distribution companies in the Netherlands, 3 wholesale businesses in our U.K. operations, and 3 salvage businesses in Sweden since the beginning of 2015 through the one-year anniversary of the acquisitions.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $158 million, or 7.9%, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling relative to 2015.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $83 million, or 41.4%, in 2016 compared to the prior year. Our Rhiag acquisition contributed $94 million to Segment EBITDA in 2016, while our Andrew Page acquisition generated a loss of $5 million. Our Europe Segment EBITDA includes a negative year over year impact of $18 million related to the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars at lower exchange rates than those experienced during 2015. On a constant currency basis (i.e. excluding the translation impact), Segment EBITDA increased by $101 million, or 50.2%, compared to the prior year. Refer to the Foreign Currency Impact discussion within the Results of Operations - Consolidated section above for further detail regarding foreign currency impact on our results for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The decrease in gross margin reflects a 1.3% decline in gross margin due to the acquisition of Rhiag, which has lower gross margins than our other Europe operations.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The decrease in segment operating expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects (i) a decrease of 1.8% in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of Rhiag, which has lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other Europe operations and (ii) a 0.3% decrease in distribution expenses in our U.K. operations due to reduced personnel costs. Partially offsetting these decreases were (i) an increase in facility and warehouse expenses of 0.8% from a 0.5% increase primarily related to the opening of 21 new branches and 6 new hubs since the prior year and 0.3% related to the addition of facility and personnel costs for the Tamworth distribution facility, and (ii) an increase of 0.3% in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of Andrew Page, which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue than our other Europe operations. While we had closed the Andrew Page acquisition and were consolidating its results, we were not permitted to integrate this acquisition with our existing U.K. operations until we received approval from the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, which concluded its approval process in October 2017.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Organic growth in Specialty parts and services revenue reflects an increase in service levels throughout North America as we continued to expand the breadth and depth of our inventory offerings and added delivery capacity to our integrated distribution network to allow us to realize synergies associated with the integration of Coast. Through most of 2016, we also saw growth from favorable macro trends and economic conditions, which increased consumer discretionary spending on automotive and recreational vehicle parts and accessories.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Acquisition related growth reflects the impact of the Coast acquisition on August 19, 2015 through the one year anniversary of the acquisition.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Compared to the prior year, exchange rates reduced our revenue growth by $3 million, or 0.3%, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S dollar against the Canadian dollar relative to 2015.

Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA increased $18 million, or 16.0%, in 2016 compared to the prior year.
The following table summarizes the changes in Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in our Specialty segment:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- -- ---

Specialty Percentage of Total Segment Revenue
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 10.5 %
(Decrease) increase due to:
Change in gross margin (0.8 )% (1)
Change in segment operating expenses 1.0 % (2)
Segment EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2016 10.7 %
Note: In the table above, the sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The decline in gross margin reflects (i) a 0.4% unfavorable impact due to customer volume rebates which have increased along with sales volume, (ii) a 0.3% increase in inventory costs, which were higher due to the stocking of two distribution centers, one of which was not yet operational in the prior year period and one which became operational in the fourth quarter of 2015, and (iii) a decrease in advertising credits of 0.3% due to higher purchase volume in 2015 from the initial stocking of those two new distribution centers. These negative effects were partially offset by a 0.4% improvement due to Coast related freight synergies as more volume went through the existing Specialty network.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) The decrease in segment operating expenses reflects a favorable 0.9% reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to (i) a 0.3% decline in personnel costs from the realization of integration synergies, (ii) lower bad debt expense of 0.2% due to increased collection efforts and (iii) individually insignificant decreases across various selling, general and administrative expense categories totaling 0.4%. Favorable distribution expenses of 0.2% due to lower fuel and freight costs were offset by an increase in facilities and warehouse expense primarily related to the higher cost of Coast facilities as well as the addition of two new distribution centers.

(2) Debt amounts reflect the gross values to be repaid (excluding debt issuance costs of $3 million and $2 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively).

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Capacity under credit facilities includes our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility. Availability under credit facilities is reduced by our letters of credit.

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to fund our operations and provide for expansion through both internal development and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and our credit facilities. We utilize our cash flows from operations to fund working capital and capital expenditures, with the excess amounts going towards funding acquisitions or paying down outstanding debt. As we have pursued acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, our cash flows from operations have not always been sufficient to cover our investing activities. To fund our acquisitions, we have accessed various forms of debt financing, including revolving credit facilities, senior notes, and a receivables securitization facility.
As of December 31, 2017, we had debt outstanding and additional available sources of financing as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Senior secured credit facilities maturing in January 2023, composed of term loans totaling $750 million ($705 million outstanding at December 31, 2017) and $2.75 billion in revolving credit ($1.3 billion outstanding at December 31, 2017), bearing interest at variable rates (although a portion of this debt is hedged through interest rate swap contracts), reduced by $71 million of amounts outstanding under letters of credit

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• U.S. Notes (2023) totaling $600 million, maturing in May 2023 and bearing interest at a 4.75% fixed rate

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Euro Notes (2024) totaling $600 million (€500 million), maturing in April 2024 and bearing interest at a 3.875% fixed rate

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Receivables securitization facility with availability up to $100 million ($100 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017), maturing in November 2019 and bearing interest at variable commercial paper rates

From time to time, we may undertake financing transactions to increase our available liquidity, such as our December 2017 and January 2016 amendments to our senior secured credit facilities, the issuance of €500 million of Euro Notes (2024) in April 2016, and the November 2016 amendment to our receivables securitization facility. Our financing structure, which includes our senior secured credit facilities, senior notes, and receivables securitization facility, provides financial flexibility to execute our long-term growth strategy. If we see an attractive acquisition opportunity, we have the ability to use our revolver to move quickly and have certainty of funding up to the amount of our then-available liquidity.
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.4 billion available under our credit facilities. Combined with approximately $280 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1.7 billion in available liquidity, an increase of $428 million over our available liquidity as of December 31, 2016. The increase in available liquidity in 2017 is primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of the glass manufacturing business in March for $301 million and the December 2017 amendment to the credit facility, which increased availability by $300 million.
In December 2017, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Stahlgruber for an enterprise value of €1.5 billion. We intend to finance the acquisition with the proceeds from planned debt offerings, borrowings under our existing revolving credit

Note 8. Long-term Debt In May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on May 20, 2021. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under the facility. ------- -----------------------------
