Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity" and Notes G and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the Company's outstanding debt and other commitments as of December 31, 2017 and the terms associated therewith.
The Company's ability to obtain additional financing is also affected by the Company's debt credit ratings and competition for available debt financing. A ratings downgrade could materially and adversely impact the Company's ability to access debt markets, increase the borrowing cost under the Company's credit facility and the cost of future debt, and potentially require the Company to post letters of credit or other forms of collateral for certain obligations.
 The Company faces significant competition and some of its competitors have resources in excess of the Company's available resources.
The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with a large number of companies, producers and operators in a number of areas such as:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• seeking to acquire oil and gas properties suitable for development or exploration;

- ------------------------------------------
• marketing oil, NGL and gas production; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise, including trained personnel, necessary to evaluate, operate and develop its properties.

Some of the Company's competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. To a lesser extent, the Company also faces competition from companies that supply alternative sources of energy, such as wind or solar power. See "Item 1. Business - Competition, Markets and Regulations" for additional discussion regarding competition.
The Company's transportation of gas, sales and purchases of oil, NGLs, gas or other energy commodities, and any derivative activities related to such energy commodities, expose the Company to potential regulatory risks.
The FERC, the FTC and the CFTC hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets relevant to the Company's business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to the Company's transportation of gas in interstate commerce, physical sales and purchases of oil, NGLs, gas or other energy commodities, and any derivative activities related to these energy commodities, the Company is required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies, which hold substantial enforcement authority. Failures to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.
Estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities and net cash flows of the Company's proved reserves may prove to be lower than estimated.
Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net cash flows therefrom. The estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows set forth in this Report are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.
Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and estimates of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;

- -------------------------------------------
• the quality and quantity of available data;

- --------------------------------
• the interpretation of that data;

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;

- ---------------------------------------------------
• assumptions concerning future commodity prices; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• assumptions concerning future development costs, operating costs, severance, ad valorem and excise taxes, transportation costs and workover and remedial costs.

Because all proved reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered;

- ------------------------------------------------------
• the production costs incurred to recover the reserves;

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• the amount and timing of future development expenditures; and

- ------------------------
• future commodity prices.

26

Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of proved reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. The Company's actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to proved reserves will likely be different from estimates, and the differences may be material.
As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on average prices preceding the date of the estimate and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:

- -------------------------------------------
• the amount and timing of actual production;

- ----------------------------------
• levels of future capital spending;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• increases or decreases in the supply of or demand for oil, NGLs and gas; and

- ------------------------------------------------
• changes in governmental regulations or taxation.

Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In general, it requires the use of commodity prices that are based upon a historical 12-month unweighted average, as well as operating and development costs being incurred at the end of the reporting period. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for future oil and gas production because of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the ten percent discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and gas industry in general. Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows or Standardized Measure in this Report should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of the Company's proved reserves.
The Company's business could be materially and adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.
As an oil and gas producer, the Company faces various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of the Company's facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected the Company's operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In particular, the Company's implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for the Company's information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Costs for insurance may also increase as a result of security threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to the Company's operations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated. The Company relies extensively on information technology systems, including Internet sites, computer software, data hosting facilities and other hardware and platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting its business. The Company's technologies systems and networks, and those of its business associates may become the target of cybersecurity attacks, including without limitation malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems and materially and adversely affect the Company in a variety of ways, including the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• unauthorized access to and release of seismic data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to compete for oil and gas resources;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure, which could result in loss of production or accidental discharge;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• unauthorized access to and release of personal identifying information of royalty owners, employees and vendors, which could expose the Company to allegations that it did not sufficiently protect that information;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a cybersecurity attack on a vendor or service provider, which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt operations; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a cybersecurity attack on third-party gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining or export facilities, which could delay or prevent the Company from transporting and marketing its production, resulting in a loss of revenues.

These events could damage the Company's reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability. Additionally, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.

As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
 A failure by purchasers of the Company's production to satisfy their obligations to the Company could require the Company to recognize a charge in earnings and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation.
The Company relies on a limited number of purchasers to purchase a majority of its products. To the extent that purchasers of the Company's production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there is a risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to the Company if such purchasers were unable to access the credit or equity markets for an extended period of time. If for any reason the Company were to determine that it was probable that some or all of the accounts receivable from any one or more of the purchasers of the Company's production were uncollectible, the Company would recognize a charge in the earnings of that period for the probable loss.
Declining general economic, business or industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.
Since 2016, the economies in the United States and certain countries in Europe and Asia have continued to stabilize with resulting improvements in industrial demand and consumer confidence. However, other economies, such as those of certain South American nations, continue to face economic struggles or slowing economic growth. If these conditions worsen, combined with a decline in economic growth in other parts of the world, there could be a significant adverse effect on global financial markets and commodity prices. In addition, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad were to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could depress the prices at which the Company could sell its oil, NGLs and gas and ultimately decrease the Company's cash flows and profitability.
The Company's use of seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and gas, which could materially and adversely affect the results of its drilling operations.
Even when properly used and interpreted, seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. As a result, the Company's drilling activities may not be successful or economic. In addition, the use of advanced technologies, such as 3-D seismic data, requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and the Company could incur losses as a result of such expenditures.
The enactment of derivatives legislation could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with its business.
The Dodd-Frank Act enacted in July 2010, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as the Company, that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations for its implementation. Although the CFTC has issued final regulations to implement significant aspects of the legislation, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished.
In October 2011, the CFTC issued regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. The initial position limits rule was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2012. However, in November 2013, the CFTC proposed new rules that would place limits on positions in certain futures and options contracts and equivalent swaps for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide derivative transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on the Company is uncertain at this time.
The CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also will require the Company, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. The CFTC has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. Although the Company believes it qualifies for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps entered to mitigate its commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that the Company uses. If the Company's swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, or if the cost of entering into uncleared swaps becomes prohibitive, the Company may be required to clear such transactions. The ultimate effect of the proposed rules and any additional regulations on the Company's business is uncertain.

In addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although the Company expects to qualify for the end-user exception from margin requirements for swaps entered into to manage its commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that the Company uses. If any of the Company's swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, the posting of collateral could reduce its liquidity and cash available for capital expenditures and could reduce its ability to manage commodity price volatility and the volatility in its cash flows.
The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon the Company's business will not be known until the regulations are implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks the Company encounters and reduce the Company's ability to monetize or restructure its existing derivative contracts. If the Company reduces its use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, the Company's results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could materially and adversely affect the Company's ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and gas. The Company's revenues could therefore be materially and adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and its results of operations. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent the Company transacts with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, it may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.
The future of the SEC and CFTC's rulemaking remains uncertain. Regulatory agendas that were released in late 2017 indicated that the SEC and CFTC plan to pursue fewer rulemaking items than in prior years. For example, the CFTC announced its intent to take action on an agency-wide internal review focused on simplifying and modernizing CFTC rules, regulations and practices and focus on streamlining the implementation of existing regulations and practices. Although the SEC and the CFTC's agendas are less expansive than they have been in the past, wholesale deregulation of the markets will not necessarily be the outcome. For example, the CFTC plans to take a new look at passing rules on position limits for certain futures contracts, and the SEC intends to re-propose rules for "plain vanilla" exchange-traded funds and add amendments to the Volcker Rule.
Moreover, regulation by the CFTC and banking regulators of the over-the-counter derivatives market and market participants could cause the Company's contract counterparties, which are generally financial institutions and other market participants, to curtail or cease their derivatives activities, which could materially and adversely affect the cost and availability of derivatives to the Company.
Provisions of the Company's charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's common stock.
Provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the Company or a merger in which the Company is not the surviving company and may otherwise prevent or slow changes in the Company's board of directors and management. In addition, because the Company is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions could discourage an acquisition of the Company or other change in control transactions and thereby negatively affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company's common stock.
The Company's sand mining operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond the Company's control, and such risks may not be covered by insurance.
Ownership of industrial sand mining operations is subject to risks, many of which are beyond the Company's control. These risks include:

- ---------------------------------------------------------
• unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures;

- ------------------------------------------
• cave-ins, pit wall failures or rock falls;

- ------------------------------------------------
• unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• inclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of climate change;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• environmental hazards, such as unauthorized spills, releases and discharges of wastes, vessel ruptures and emission of unpermitted levels of pollutants;

- --------------------------------
• changes in laws and regulations;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;

- ------------------------------------
• restrictions on blasting operations;

29

Table of Contents
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
• inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;

- ----------------------------------------------------------
• reduction in the amount of water available for processing;

- -----------------------------------
• technical difficulties or failures;

- ---------------
• labor disputes;

- --------------------------
• late delivery of supplies;

- -----------------------------------------
• fires, explosions or other accidents; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• facility interruptions or shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions.

Any of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company's mining properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses or possible legal liability. Not all of these risks are insurable, and the Company's insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles, exclusions and endorsements. The Company's insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet its needs in the event of loss and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The Company's estimates of sand reserves and resource deposits are imprecise and actual reserves could be less than estimated.
The Company bases its sand reserve and resource estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by engineers and geologists, which are periodically reviewed by outside firms. However, commercial sand reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of commercial sand reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Estimates of economically recoverable commercial sand reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• geological and mining conditions or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• assumptions concerning future prices of commercial sand products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.

The Company's sand mining operations are subject to extensive environmental and occupational health and safety regulations that impose significant costs and potential liabilities.
The Company's sand mining operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental requirements affecting the mining and mineral processing industry, including, among others, those relating to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air emissions and water discharges, GHG emissions, water pollution, waste management and disposal, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use restrictions, reclamation and restoration of properties, wastes, hazardous substances and other regulated materials and natural resources. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for noncompliance, and others, such as the CERCLA, impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances. Failure to properly handle, transport, store or dispose of wastes, hazardous substances and other regulated materials or otherwise conduct the Company's sand mining operations in compliance with environmental laws could expose the Company to liability for governmental penalties, cleanup costs and civil or criminal liability associated with releases of such materials into the environment, damages to property or natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair the Company's ability to conduct its sand mining operations. In addition, environmental laws and regulations are subject to amendment, replacement or re-interpretation by more stringent and comprehensive legal requirements. While the Company's environmental compliance costs with existing laws and regulations have not historically had a material adverse effect on its results of operations, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future. Moreover, such future compliance with existing, new or amended laws and regulations could restrict the Company's ability to expand its facilities or extract mineral deposits or could require the Company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with its sand mining operations, which restrictions or costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations.
Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in connection with its sand mining operations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that could materially and adversely affect the Company, including:

- ---------------------------------------------------------
• issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• denial, modification or revocation of permits or other authorizations;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• imposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on the Company's operations, including interruptions or cessation of operations; and

30

PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• requirements to perform site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.

In addition to environmental regulation, the Company's sand mining operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, including such matters as human exposure to crystalline silica dust. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including the MSHA, may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment.
The Company's sand mining operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 and amending legislation, which impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of the Company's sand mining operations.
The Company's sand mining operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters. This Act, as amended, is a strict liability statute and any failure by the Company to comply with such existing or any future standards, or any more stringent interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations or otherwise impose significant restrictions on the Company's ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.
The Company's sand mining operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations that impose significant costs and liabilities.
In addition to the environmental and occupational health and safety regulation discussed above, the Company's sand mining operations are also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, and the effects that mining have on groundwater quality and availability. Also, the Company's sand mining operations require numerous governmental, mining and other permits and water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each sand mining facility.
In order to obtain permits, renewals of permits or other approvals in the future for its sand mining operations, the Company may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the effect that any such activities may have on the environment. Obtaining or renewing required permits or approvals may be delayed or prevented due to opposition by neighboring property owners, members of the public or other third parties and other factors beyond the Company's control. Moreover, issuance of any permits, permit renewals or other approvals by governmental agencies may be conditioned on new or modified requirements or procedures with respect to mining that may be costly or time-consuming to implement. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations at the affected facility. Current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sand mining operations and the Company may not be able to renew or obtain permits or other approvals in the future.
 The Company's sand mining operations and hydraulic fracturing may result in silica-related health issues and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
The inhalation of respirable crystalline silica dust is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders, such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the commercial sand industry. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling sand could materially and adversely affect the Company through the threat of product liability or personal injury lawsuits, recently adopted OSHA silica regulations and increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities.
Pioneer Sands LLC ("Pioneer Sands"), the Company's wholly-owned sand mining subsidiary, is named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous products liability lawsuits brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of Pioneer Sands or its commercial customers alleging damages caused by silica exposure. As of December 31, 2017, Pioneer Sands was the subject of silica exposure claims from 19 plaintiffs. Almost all of the claims pending against Pioneer Sands arise out of the alleged use of Pioneer Sands' sand products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Texas, Mississippi and Alabama, although some cases have been brought in other jurisdictions over the years.
It is possible that Pioneer Sands will have additional silica-related claims filed against it, including claims that allege silica exposure for periods for which there is not insurance coverage. In addition, it is possible that similar claims could be asserted arising out of the Company's other operations, including its hydraulic fracturing operations. Any pending or future claims or inadequacies of insurance coverage or contractual indemnification could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.

Reserve Estimation Procedures and Audits
The information included in this Report about the Company's proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is based on evaluations prepared by the Company's engineers and audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSAI"), with respect to the Company's major properties. The Company has no oil and gas reserves from non-traditional sources. Additionally, the Company does not provide optional disclosure of probable or possible reserves.
Reserve estimation procedures. The Company has established internal controls over reserve estimation processes and procedures to support the accurate and timely preparation and disclosure of reserve estimates in accordance with SEC requirements. These controls include oversight of the reserves estimation reporting processes by Pioneer's Corporate Reserves Group ("Corporate Reserves"), and annual external audits of substantial portions of the Company's proved reserves by NSAI.
Corporate Reserves is responsible for the management of the oil and gas proved reserve estimation processes in each of the Company's Permian Basin, South Texas, Raton and West Panhandle asset areas. Corporate Reserves is staffed with reservoir engineers and geoscientists who prepare reserve estimates at the end of each calendar quarter for the assets that they manage, using reservoir engineering information technology. There is oversight of the reservoir engineers by the Director of Corporate Reserves and the Vice President of Corporate Reserves, each of whom is in turn subject to direct or indirect oversight by the Company's management committee ("MC"). The Company's MC is comprised of its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other executive officers. The reserve estimates are prepared by reservoir engineers before being submitted to the Director and Vice President of Corporate Reserves for further review.
The reserve estimates are summarized in reserve reconciliations that quantify reserve changes since the previous year end as revisions of previous estimates, purchases of minerals-in-place, improved recovery, extensions and discoveries, production and

32

sales of minerals-in-place. All reserve estimates, material assumptions and inputs used in reserve estimates and significant changes in reserve estimates are reviewed for engineering and financial appropriateness and compliance with SEC and GAAP standards by Corporate Reserves, in consultation with the Company's accounting and financial management personnel. Annually, the MC reviews the reserve estimates and any differences with the reserve auditors (for the portion of the reserves audited by NSAI) on a consolidated basis before these estimates are approved. The engineers and geoscientists who participate in the reserve estimation and disclosure process periodically attend training provided by external consultants and through internal Pioneer programs. Additionally, Corporate Reserves has prepared and maintains written policies and guidelines for its staff to reference on reserve estimation and preparation to promote consistency in the preparation of the Company's reserve estimates and compliance with the SEC reserve estimation and reporting rules.
Proved reserves audits. The proved reserve audits performed by NSAI for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, in the aggregate, represented 77 percent, 77 percent and 82 percent of the Company's year-end 2017, 2016 and 2015 proved reserves, respectively; and 91 percent, 93 percent and 97 percent of the Company's year-end 2017, 2016 and 2015 associated pre-tax present value of proved reserves discounted at ten percent, respectively.
NSAI follows the general principles set forth in the "Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserve Information" promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (the "SPE"). A reserve audit as defined by the SPE is not the same as a financial audit. The SPE's definition of a reserve audit includes the following concepts:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A reserve audit is an examination of reserve information that is conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether such reserve information, in the aggregate, is reasonable and has been presented in conformity with the 2007 SPE publication entitled "Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information."

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The estimation of reserves is an imprecise science due to the many unknown geologic and reservoir factors that cannot be estimated through sampling techniques. Since reserves are only estimates, they cannot be audited for the purpose of verifying exactness. Instead, reserve information is audited for the purpose of reviewing in sufficient detail the policies, procedures and methods used by a company in estimating its reserves so that the reserve auditors may express an opinion as to whether, in the aggregate, the reserve information furnished by a company is reasonable.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The methods and procedures used by a company, and the reserve information furnished by a company, must be reviewed in sufficient detail to permit the reserve auditor, in its professional judgment, to express an opinion as to the reasonableness of the reserve information. The auditing procedures require the reserve auditor to prepare their own estimates of reserve information for the audited properties.

In conjunction with the audit of the Company's proved reserves and associated pre-tax present value discounted at ten percent, Pioneer provided to NSAI its external and internal engineering and geoscience technical data and analyses. Following NSAI's review of that data, it had the option of honoring Pioneer's interpretations, or making its own interpretations. No data was withheld from NSAI. NSAI accepted without independent verification the accuracy and completeness of the historical information and data furnished by Pioneer with respect to ownership interest, oil and gas production, well test data, commodity prices, operating and development costs, and any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. However, if in the course of its evaluations something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data.
In the course of its evaluations, NSAI prepared, for all of the audited properties, its own estimates of the Company's proved reserves and the pre-tax present values of such reserves discounted at ten percent. NSAI reviewed its audit differences with the Company, and, in a number of cases, held meetings with the Company to review additional reserves work performed by the Company's technical teams and any updated performance data related to the proved reserve differences. Such data was incorporated, as appropriate, by both parties into the proved reserve estimates. NSAI's estimates, including any adjustments resulting from additional data, of those proved reserves and the pre-tax present value of such reserves discounted at ten percent did not differ from Pioneer's estimates by more than ten percent in the aggregate. However, when compared on a lease-by-lease, field-by-field or area-by-area basis, some of the Company's estimates were greater than those of the reserve auditors and some were less than the estimates of the reserve auditors. When such differences do not exceed ten percent in the aggregate and NSAI is satisfied that the proved reserves and pre-tax present values of such reserves discounted at ten percent are reasonable and that its audit objectives have been met, NSAI will issue an unqualified audit opinion. Remaining differences are not resolved due to the limited cost benefit of continuing such analyses by the Company and the reserve auditors. At the conclusion of the audit process, it was NSAI's opinion, as set forth in its audit letter, which is included as an exhibit to this Report, that Pioneer's estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves and associated pre-tax present values discounted at ten percent are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been

Technologies used in proved reserves estimates. Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped proved reserves only if an ability and intent has been established to drill the reserves within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.
In the context of reserves estimations, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and reliable technology means a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonable certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In estimating proved reserves, the Company uses several different traditional methods such as performance-based methods, volumetric-based methods and analogy with similar properties. In addition, the Company utilizes additional technical analysis such as seismic interpretation, wireline formation tests, geophysical logs and core data to provide incremental support for more complex reservoirs. Information from this incremental support is combined with the traditional technologies outlined above to enhance the certainty of the Company's proved reserve estimates.

Permian Basin. In November 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey ("USGS") announced, based on its estimates, that the Wolfcamp shale in the Permian Basin is the largest continuous oil field in the United States. Pioneer is the largest acreage holder in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field, with approximately 750,000 gross acres (660,000 net acres). Pioneer's interests in the northern portion of the play comprise approximately 550,000 gross acres and its interests in the southern portion of the play, where the Company has a joint venture with Sinochem, comprise approximately 200,000 gross acres. The oil produced from the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field is West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and the gas produced is casinghead gas with an average energy content of 1,400 Btu. The oil and gas are produced primarily from seven formations, the upper and lower Spraberry, the Jo Mill, the Dean, the Wolfcamp, the Strawn and the Atoka, at depths ranging from 7,500 feet to 14,000 feet. The Company believes that it has significant resource potential within its Spraberry and Wolfcamp formation acreage, based on its extensive geologic data covering the Spraberry and Wolfcamp A, B, C and D intervals and its drilling results to date.
During 2017, the Company successfully completed 183 horizontal wells in the northern portion of the play and 40 horizontal wells in the southern portion of the play. In the northern portion of the play, approximately 50 percent of the horizontal wells placed on production were Wolfcamp B interval wells, approximately 35 percent were Wolfcamp A interval wells and approximately 15 percent were Lower Spraberry Shale interval wells. The majority of the wells placed on production in the southern portion of the play were Wolfcamp B interval wells. In addition, during 2017, the Company completed acreage trades that allow the Company to drill wells with longer laterals, improving the expected returns of the wells. The Company estimates that the acreage trades completed in 2017 added approximately 7.2 million lateral feet to the Company's drilling inventory.
The Company plans to operate 20 rigs in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field in 2018, with 16 rigs operating in the northern portion of the play and four rigs operating in the southern portion of the play. During 2018, the Company expects to place on production between 250 and 275 horizontal wells (200 to 225 horizontal wells in the northern portion of the play and approximately 50 horizontal wells in the southern portion of the play). Approximately 60 percent of the horizontal wells are planned to be drilled in the Wolfcamp B interval, 25 percent in the Wolfcamp A interval and the remaining 15 percent will be a combination of wells in the Spraberry Shale intervals (Jo Mill, Lower Spraberry and Middle Spraberry) and a limited appraisal program for the Clearfork and Wolfcamp D intervals. The Company's 2018 appraisal program includes appraising: (i) its first Clearfork horizontal well (located in Midland County), (ii) seven wells in the Jo Mill and Middle Spraberry intervals in conjunction with nine Lower Spraberry Shale wells to determine an optimal development strategy for the Spraberry formation (these appraisals will test different spacing, staggering, sequencing, and completion design) and (iii) three Wolfcamp D interval wells.
The Company expects to spend $2.6 billion in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field during 2018, including $2.0 billion of horizontal drilling and completion capital, $300 million for tank battery and disposal facilities, $170 million for gas processing facilities and $110 million for land, science and other costs.
The Company continues to utilize its integrated services to control well costs and operating costs in addition to supporting the execution of its drilling and production activities in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field. The majority of 2018 drilling activities will be supported by seven of the Company's eight pressure pumping fleets. The Company also owns other field service equipment that supports its drilling and production operations, including pulling units, fracture stimulation tanks, water transport trucks, hot oilers, blowout preventers, construction equipment and fishing tools. The 2018 capital budget includes $78 million for upgrades and maintenance to the Company's pressure pumping and well service equipment.
The Company's sand mine in Brady, Texas, which is strategically located within close proximity (approximately190 miles) of the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field, provides a secure sand source for the Company's horizontal drilling program. In addition, Pioneer has signed a contract for its initial offtake of sand sourced in West Texas where significant new sand supplies are expected to be

37

PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

available in 2018. The Company is evaluating additional contracts for lower cost sand sourced in West Texas. As a result of the expected supply growth of West Texas sand, the planned expansion of the Company’s sand mine at Brady, Texas has been deferred.
In addition to the efficiencies from the Company's integrated services, the Company has been and continues to pursue initiatives to improve drilling and completion efficiencies and reduce costs. The Company's long-term growth plan continues to focus on optimizing the development of the field and addressing the future requirements for water sourcing and disposal, field infrastructure, gas processing, pipeline takeaway capacity for its products, oilfield services, tubulars, electricity, buildings and roads.
The Company is constructing a field-wide water distribution system to reduce the cost of water for drilling and completion activities and to secure adequate supplies of non-potable water to support the Company's long-term growth plan for the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field. Over the past few years, the Company has expanded its mainline system, subsystems and frac ponds to efficiently deliver water to many of Pioneer's drilling locations. The Company is purchasing approximately 120 thousand barrels per day of effluent water from the City of Odessa and has signed an agreement with the City of Midland to upgrade the City's wastewater treatment plant in return for a dedicated long-term supply of water from the plant. Once the Midland plant upgrade is complete, the Company expects to receive approximately two billion barrels of low-cost, non-potable water over a 28-year contract period (up to 240 thousand barrels per day) to support its completion operations. During 2018, the Company expects to spend approximately $135 million to begin the Midland plant upgrade construction and build additional subsystems, frac ponds and produced water reuse facilities.
South Texas Eagle Ford Shale. During 2017, the Company operated two rigs in the Eagle Ford Shale area and drilled 11 new Eagle Ford Shale wells. The objective of this drilling program was to test longer laterals with wider spacing and higher intensity completions in the new wells. The Company's 2017 completions included 25 wells in South Texas, comprising 11 new Eagle Ford Shale wells and nine wells that were drilled but not completed in 2016, as well as five oil wells in the Wilcox formation that were drilled and placed on production during 2017.
See Note Q of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Company's plan to sell its South Texas assets.
Raton Basin. The Raton Basin properties are located in the southeast portion of Colorado. The Company owns approximately 180,000 gross acres (165,000 net acres) in the center of the Raton Basin and produces coal bed methane gas from the coal seams in the Vermejo and Raton formations from approximately 2,200 wells.
See Note Q of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Company's plan to sell its Raton Basin assets.
West Panhandle. The West Panhandle properties are located in the panhandle region of Texas. These stable, long-lived reserves are attributable to the Red Cave, Brown Dolomite, Granite Wash and fractured Granite formations at depths no greater than 3,500 feet. The Company's gas has an average energy content of 1,400 Btu and is produced from approximately 700 wells on approximately 240,000 gross and net acres covering approximately 375 square miles.
See Note Q of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Company's plan to sell its West Panhandle assets.
See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the impairment charges recorded during 2017, 2016 and 2015 to reduce the carrying value of the Company's properties in the Raton, West Panhandle, South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale and South Texas - Other fields.

Selected Oil and Gas Information
The following tables set forth selected oil and gas information for the Company as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results.
Production, price and cost data. The price that the Company receives for the oil and gas it produces is largely a function of market supply and demand. Demand is affected by general economic conditions, weather and other seasonal conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms. Over or under supply of oil or gas can result in substantial price volatility. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and the Company expects that volatility to continue in the future. A decline in oil and gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and the Company's ability to access capital markets.

Of the 91,313 net acres expiring in 2018 and 2019, 60,485 net acres (66 percent) are concentrated in eastern Colorado. Over the past few years, the Company has conducted limited exploratory activities across this acreage. The Company's exploratory drilling activities have not resulted in discovering commercial quantities of hydrocarbons; therefore, no proved reserves have been attributed to any of this acreage. The remainder of the net undeveloped acres expiring over the next two year period is primarily concentrated in the Permian Basin in West Texas, where the Company has an active drilling program and ongoing efforts to extend leases that may not be drilled prior to expiration. The Company currently has no proved undeveloped reserve locations scheduled to be drilled after lease expiration.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Financial and Operating Performance
Pioneer's financial and operating performance for 2017 included the following highlights:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net income attributable to common stockholders was $833 million ($4.85 per diluted share) for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a net loss of $556 million ($3.34 per diluted share) in 2016. The primary components of the $1,389 million increase in earnings attributable to common stockholders include:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $1.1 billion increase in oil and gas revenues as a result a 25 percent increase in average realized commodity prices per BOE, combined with a 16 percent increase in sales volumes;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $206 million increase in net gains on disposition of assets, primarily due to recognizing a gain of $194 million on the sale of approximately 20,500 acres in the Martin County region of the Permian Basin during 2017;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $121 million increase in the Company's income tax benefit, primarily as a result of a reduction in deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate beginning in 2018;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an $80 million decrease in DD&A expense, primarily attributable to (i) commodity price increases and the Company's cost reduction initiatives, both of which had the effect of adding proved reserves by lengthening the economic lives of the Company's producing wells and (ii) additions to proved reserves attributable to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $61 million decrease in net derivative losses, primarily as a result of changes in forward commodity prices, the cash settlement of derivative positions in accordance with their terms and changes in the Company's portfolio of derivatives;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $54 million decrease in interest expense, primarily due to the repayment of both the Company's 6.65% senior notes, which matured in March 2017, and the Company's 5.875% senior notes, which matured in July 2016;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $44 million decrease in other expense, primarily related to reductions in idle drilling and well service equipment charges and net losses from Company-provided fracture stimulation and related service operations that are provided to third party working interest owners, partially offset by an increase in unused firm transportation costs;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $33 million decrease in losses associated with purchases and sales of oil and gas used to fulfill transportation commitments;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $21 million increase in interest and other income, primarily due to interest received from the Company's short-term and long-term investments and severance tax refunds; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $13 million decrease in exploration and abandonment charges, primarily due to writing off the Company's unproved acreage in Alaska during 2016 when it was determined that it was no longer expected to be developed; partially offset by

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a $253 million increase in impairment charges, principally related to the impairment charge recorded in 2017 to reduce the carrying value of the Company's Raton field; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an $89 million increase in total oil and gas production costs and production and ad valorem taxes as of a result of the aforementioned increases in commodity prices and sales volumes.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During 2017, average daily sales volumes increased on a BOE basis by 16 percent to 272,330 BOEPD, as compared to 233,842 BOEPD during 2016, primarily due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Average oil, NGL and gas prices increased during 2017 to $48.24 per Bbl, $19.31 per Bbl and $2.63 per Mcf, respectively, as compared to $39.65 per Bbl, $13.49 per Bbl and $2.11 per Mcf, respectively in 2016.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net cash provided by operating activities increased by 39 percent to $2.1 billion for 2017, as compared to $1.5 billion during 2016, primarily due to increases in the Company's oil and gas revenues in 2017 as a result of increases in commodity prices and sales volumes, partially offset by a $613 million reduction in cash provided by commodity derivatives.

First Quarter 2018 Outlook
Based on current estimates, the Company expects the following operating and financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018:
Production is forecasted to average 304,000 to 314,000 BOEPD.

• Other assets - $20 million.

The 2018 capital budget is expected to be funded from a combination of operating cash flow, cash and cash equivalents on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments and, if necessary, proceeds from planned asset divestitures or borrowings under the Company's credit facility.

 Acquisitions
During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company spent $136 million, $446 million and $36 million, respectively, to acquire primarily undeveloped acreage for future exploitation and exploration activities in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field of the Permian Basin. During 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of approximately 28,000 net acres in the Permian Basin, with net production of approximately 1,400 BOEPD, from an unaffiliated third party for $428 million. See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Company's acquisitions.

Divestitures
In February 2018, the Company announced its intention to divest its properties in South Texas, Raton and the West Panhandle field and focus its efforts and capital resources to its Permian Basin assets. No assurance can be given that the sales will be completed in accordance with the Company's plans or on terms and at prices acceptable to the Company.
In April 2017, the Company completed the sale of approximately 20,500 acres in the Martin County region of the Permian Basin, with net production of approximately1,500 BOEPD, to an unaffiliated third party for cash proceeds of $264 million. The sale resulted in a gain of $194 million. In conjunction with the divestiture, the Company reduced the carrying value of goodwill by $2 million, reflecting the portion of the Company's goodwill related to the assets sold.
In July 2015, the Company completed the sale of its 50.1 percent equity interest in EFS Midstream to an unaffiliated third party, with the Company receiving total consideration of $1.0 billion, of which $530 million was received at closing and the remaining $501 million was received in July 2016. The Company recorded a net gain on the disposition of $777 million in September 2015.
See Notes C, D and Q of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Company's divestitures in 2017 and 2015 and it's planned divestitures of South Texas, Raton and the West Panhandle field.

Results of Operations
Oil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues totaled $3.5 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The increase in 2017 oil and gas revenues relative to 2016 is primarily due to increases of 19 percent, 26 percent and 4 percent in oil, NGL and gas sales volumes, respectively, and increases of 22 percent, 43 percent and 25 percent in oil, NGL and gas prices, respectively.
The increase in 2016 oil and gas revenues relative to 2015 is primarily due to increases of 27 percent and 13 percent in oil and NGL sales volumes, respectively, partially offset by a six percent decline in gas sales volumes and declines of nine percent and 12 percent in oil and gas prices, respectively.
Average daily sales volumes in 2017 and 2016 increased by 16 percent and 15 percent, respectively, as compared to the average daily sales volumes in the respective prior years, principally due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.
The following table provides average daily sales volumes from continuing operations for 2017, 2016 and 2015:

Total (per BOE) $ 35.39 $ 28.25 $ 29.25

Sales of purchased oil and gas. The Company periodically enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure available oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company's areas of production. The Company enters into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to diversify a portion of the Company's WTI oil sales to a Gulf Coast or international export market price and to satisfy unused pipeline capacity commitments. Revenues and expenses from these transactions are presented on a gross basis as the Company acts as a principal in the transaction by assuming both the risk and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, of the commodities purchased and the responsibility to deliver the commodities sold. The transportation costs associated with these transactions are presented on a net basis in purchased oil and gas expense. The net effect of third party purchases and sales of oil and gas for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a loss of $31 million, as compared to a loss of $64 million and a loss of $39 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Firm transportation payments on excess pipeline capacity are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for further information on unused transportation commitment charges.
Interest and other income. The Company's interest and other income was $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $32 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in interest and other income during 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to (i) an increase of $11 million in severance, sales and property tax refunds and (ii) an increase of $10 million in interest income on short-term and long-term investments. The increase in interest and other income during 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to (i) an increase of $19 million in interest income on short-term and long-term investments, partially offset by (ii) a decrease of $5 million in equity interest in income of EFS Midstream. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information about the Company's interest and other income.

Derivative gains (losses), net. The Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $100 million of net derivative losses, compared to $161 million of net derivative losses and $879 million of net derivative gains for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on commodity price, diesel price, interest rate and marketing derivatives. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company received net cash receipts of $74 million, $690 million and $876 million, respectively, from its derivative activities.
The following table details the net cash receipts on the Company's commodity derivatives and the relative price impact (per Bbl or Mcf) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

The Company's open derivative contracts are subject to continuing market risk. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information about the Company's derivative contracts.
Gain on disposition of assets, net. The Company recorded net gains on the disposition of assets of $208 million, $2 million and $782 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's gain on disposition of assets is primarily due to a gain of $194 million recognized on the sale of approximately 20,500 acres in the Martin County region of the Permian Basin. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's gains on disposition of assets are primarily due to the gain of $777 million recognized on the sale of EFS Midstream. See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Company's net gains on disposition of assets.
Oil and gas production costs. The Company recognized oil and gas production costs from continuing operations of $591 million, $581 million and $717 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Lease operating expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while third party transportation charges represent the cost to transport volumes produced to a sales point. Net natural gas plant/gathering charges represent the net costs to gather and process the Company's gas, reduced by net revenues earned from gathering and processing of third party gas in Company-owned facilities.
The following table provides the components of the Company's total production costs per BOE for 2017, 2016 and 2015:

-------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- - ----

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Lease operating expenses $ 4.58 $ 5.02 $ 7.24
Third party transportation charges 0.85 1.41 1.60
Net natural gas plant (income) charges (0.28 ) 0.01 0.16
Workover costs 0.80 0.35 0.62
Total production costs $ 5.95 $ 6.79 $ 9.62

Total oil and gas production costs per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 12 percent as compared to 2016. The decrease in lease operating expenses per BOE is primarily due to a greater proportion of the Company's production coming from horizontal wells in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area that have lower per BOE lease operating costs and the Company's cost reduction initiatives. The decrease in third party transportation costs per BOE is due to a lower proportion of the Company's

total production being subject to higher Eagle Ford Shale transportation costs. The net natural gas plant income per BOE is primarily reflective of increased earnings on third party volumes that are processed in the Company-owned facilities due to higher NGL and gas prices. The increase in workover costs per BOE was primarily due to an increase in Permian vertical well workover activity due to the improvement in commodity prices.
Total oil and gas production costs per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased 29 percent as compared to 2015. The decrease in lease operating expenses per BOE is also primarily due to a greater proportion of the Company's production coming from horizontal wells in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area that have lower per BOE lease operating costs, cost reduction initiatives and lower electricity and fuel costs, which are impacted by lower commodity prices. The decline in workover costs per BOE was primarily due to reduced workover activity on the older vertical wells, as such activity was generally uneconomical as a result of the lower commodity price environment.
Production and ad valorem taxes. The Company recorded production and ad valorem taxes of $215 million during 2017, as compared to $136 million and $145 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. In general, production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, Texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. The increase in production and ad valorem taxes per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016, is primarily due to the increase in commodity prices during 2017 and, for ad valorem tax purposes, the higher valuation attributable to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program in 2017. The decrease in production and ad valorem taxes per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to the decrease in commodity prices during 2016.
The following table provides the Company's production and ad valorem taxes per BOE for 2017, 2016 and 2015:

------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- - ----

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Production taxes $ 1.59 $ 1.14 $ 1.19
Ad valorem taxes 0.57 0.46 0.76
Total ad valorem and production taxes $ 2.16 $ 1.60 $ 1.95

 Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company's total DD&A expense was $1.4 billion ($14.08 per BOE), $1.5 billion ($17.29 per BOE), and $1.4 billion ($18.59 per BOE) for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Depletion expense on oil and gas properties, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $13.61, $16.77 and $18.01 per BOE during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Depletion expense on oil and gas properties for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 19 percent as compared to 2016. The decrease is primarily due to (i) additions to proved reserves attributable to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program and (ii) commodity price increases and cost reduction initiatives, both of which had the effect of adding proved reserves by lengthening the economic lives of the Company's producing wells.
Depletion expense on oil and gas properties was $16.77 during 2016, as compared to $18.01 during 2015. The seven percent decrease in per BOE depletion expense, as compared to that of 2015 was primarily due to (i) reserve additions attributable to the Company's successful drilling activities and (ii) cost reduction initiatives that lowered expected lease operating expense, which had the effect of adding reserves by lengthening the economic life of the Company's producing wells.
Impairment of oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets. The Company recorded impairment expense to reduce the carrying values of oil and gas properties by $285 million, $32 million and $1.1 billion during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
The Company performs assessments of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable. In order to perform these assessments, management uses various observable and unobservable inputs, including management's outlooks for (i) proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (ii) commodity prices, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures and (v) production. Management's long-term commodity price outlooks are developed based on third party longer-term commodity futures price outlooks as of a measurement date ("Management's Price Outlooks").
As a result of the Company's impairment assessments, the Company recognized pretax, noncash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of (i) the Raton field ($285 million) during the year ended December 31, 2017, (ii) the West Panhandle field ($32 million) during the year ended December 31, 2016 and (iii) the Eagle Ford Shale field ($846 million), the West Panhandle field ($138 million) and the South Texas - Other field ($72 million) during the year ended December 31, 2015.

It is reasonably possible that the Company's estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows may change in the future resulting in the need to impair the carrying values of its properties. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows are (i) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves (ii) results of future drilling activities, (iii) changes in Management's Price Outlooks and (iv) increases or decreases in production and capital costs associated with these fields.
See Notes B and D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Company's impairment assessments.
Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the Company's geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes expense and leasehold abandonments and other exploration expense for 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):

-------------------------------- ----------------------- --- ---- -- ---- --- -- - --

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Geological and geophysical $ 84 $ 77 $ 71
Exploratory well costs 10 1 17
Leasehold abandonments and other 12 41 11
 $ 106 $ 119 $ 99

During 2017, the Company's exploration and abandonment expense was primarily attributable to $84 million of geological and geophysical costs, of which $66 million was geological and geophysical administrative costs, $10 million associated with unsuccessful exploration wells and $12 million of leasehold abandonment expense and other. During 2017, the Company completed and evaluated 224 exploration/extension wells, 99 percent of which were successfully completed as discoveries.
During 2016, the Company's exploration and abandonment expense was primarily attributable to $77 million of geological and geophysical costs, of which $70 million was geological and geophysical administrative costs, and $41 million of leasehold abandonment expense, which included $32 million associated with unproved acreage in Alaska in which the Company held an overriding royalty interest. During 2016, the Company completed and evaluated 215 exploration/extension wells, all of which were successfully completed as discoveries.
During 2015, the Company's exploration and abandonment expense was primarily attributable to $71 million of geological and geophysical costs, of which $60 million was geological and geophysical administrative costs; $17 million of unsuccessful exploration wells, primarily related to drilling activities attributable to the Company's unproved acreage position in southeast Colorado; and $11 million of leasehold abandonment expense, which includes $7 million associated with the Company's unproved acreage position in southeast Colorado. During 2015, the Company completed and evaluated 220 exploration/extension wells, 218 of which were successfully completed as discoveries.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense totaled $326 million ($3.28 per BOE), $325 million ($3.80 per BOE) and $327 million ($4.39 per BOE) during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The 2017 and 2016 decreases in general and administrative expense per BOE were primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of 16 percent and 15 percent, respectively, combined with the Company's cost reduction initiatives, including not replacing personnel who have left the Company and reduced contractor activity.
Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations was $19 million, $18 million and $12 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's asset retirement obligations.
Interest expense. Interest expense was $153 million, $207 million and $187 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared 2016, was primarily due to the repayment of both the Company's 6.65% Senior Notes, which matured in March 2017, and the Company's 5.875% Senior Notes, which matured in July 2016. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the Company's December 2015 issuance of $500 million of 3.45% Senior Notes due 2021 and $500 million of 4.45% Senior Notes due 2026. The weighted average interest rate on the Company's indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 5.6 percent, as compared to 6.0 percent and 6.9 percent for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
See Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information about the Company's long-term debt and interest expense.

Other expense. Other expense was $244 million during 2017, as compared to $288 million during 2016 and $315 million during 2015. The $44 million decrease in other expense during 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to (i) a decrease of $64 million in idle drilling and well service equipment charges and (ii) a decrease of $37 million in net losses from Company-provided fracture stimulation and related service operations that are provided to third party working interest owners, partially offset by (iii) an increase of $58 million in unused firm transportation costs.
The $27 million decrease in other expense during 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to decreases of (i) $78 million in inventory and other property and equipment impairment charges, (ii) $28 million in idle drilling and well service equipment charges and (iii) $19 million in restructuring charges (see further information below), partially offset by increases of (iv) $56 million in unused firm transportation costs and (v) $20 million in net losses from Company-provided fracture stimulation and related service operations that are provided to third party working interest owners.
In February 2016, the Company announced plans to restructure its pressure pumping operations in South Texas, including relocating its two Eagle Ford Shale pressure pumping fleets to the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area. In connection therewith, the Company offered severance to certain employees and relocated a number of other employees from its South Texas locations to its operations in the Permian Basin. The initiative was substantially complete as of December 31, 2016. In connection therewith, the Company recognized $4 million of restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2016. The restructuring costs included $3 million in cash employee severance costs and $1 million in employee relocation and other costs.
In May 2015, the Company announced plans to restructure its operations in Colorado, including closing its office in Denver, Colorado and eliminating its Trinidad-based pressure pumping services operations. The restructuring plan was substantially complete as of December 31, 2015. In connection therewith, the Company recognized $23 million of restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2015, which includes approximately $17 million in employee severance costs and $6 million in office lease-related costs.
The Company expects to continue to incur charges associated with excess firm gathering and transportation commitments and vertical integration operations until commodity prices improve, allowing the Company to increase its drilling activities, or, in the case of gathering and transportation commitments, the contractual obligations expire.
See Notes B, J and N of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's other expenses.
Income tax benefit. The Company recognized an income tax benefit attributable to earnings from continuing operations of $524 million during 2017, as compared to an income tax benefit of $403 million and $155 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations, excluding income from noncontrolling interest, for 2017 was a negative 170 percent for 2017 and 42 percent and 37 percent for 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the combined United States federal and state statutory rates of approximately 36 percent.
The Company's effective tax rate for 2017 differs from the combined statutory rate primarily due to the enactment on December 22, 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Reform Legislation"), which made significant changes to the United States federal income tax law. The most significant change affecting the Company was a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent beginning January 1, 2018. This rate change resulted in a $625 million income tax benefit during 2017, primarily associated with the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax liabilities at the new corporate tax rate as of December 31, 2017. Excluding the effects of the Tax Reform Legislation, the Company's effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 33 percent.
The effective rate for 2016 differs from the combined statutory rate primarily due to recognizing research and experimental expenditures credits of $72 million during 2016 and, to a lesser extent, state income tax apportionments and nondeductible expenses.
The Tax Reform Legislation also repealed corporate alternative minimum tax ("AMT") for tax years beginning in January 1, 2018, and provides that existing AMT credit carryovers are refundable beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had AMT credit carryovers of $20 million that are expected to be fully refunded by 2022.
The Tax Reform Legislation preserves the deductibility of intangible drilling costs and provides for 100 percent bonus depreciation on personal tangible property expenditures through 2022. The bonus depreciation percentage is phased down from 100 percent beginning in 2023 through 2026.
The Tax Reform Legislation is a comprehensive bill containing other provisions, such as limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation, that are not expected to materially affect Pioneer. The ultimate impact of the Tax Reform Legislation may differ from the Company's estimates as of December 31, 2017 due to changes in the interpretations and assumptions made by the Company as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued.

PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $124 million and $112 million, respectively, resulting from research and experimental expenditures related to horizontal drilling and completion innovations. If all or a portion of the unrecognized tax benefit is sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, the tax benefit will be recognized as a reduction to the Company's deferred tax liability and will affect the Company's effective tax rate in the period it is recognized. The Company expects to substantially resolve the uncertainties associated with the unrecognized tax benefits by December 2018.
See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's income tax rates and tax attributes.
Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. In 2015, the Company recognized losses from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $7 million related to plugging and abandonment obligations associated with two Gulf of Mexico wells that Pioneer divested in 2009. The results of operations for these assets were recorded in discontinued operations upon their divestiture and therefore the costs incurred subsequent to their divestiture are reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's discontinued operations .

Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity
Capital commitments. The Company's primary needs for cash are for (i) capital expenditures, (ii) acquisitions of oil and gas properties, vertical integration assets and facilities, (iii) payments of contractual obligations, including debt maturities, (iv) dividends and share repurchases and (v) working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, cash and cash equivalents on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments, proceeds from divestitures or external financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" below. During 2018, the Company expects that it will be able to fund its needs for cash (excluding acquisitions, if any) with a combination of internally generated cash flows, cash and cash equivalents on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments and, if necessary, availability under the Company's credit facility, or proceeds from divestitures of nonstrategic assets. Although the Company expects that these sources of funding will be adequate to fund capital expenditures, dividend payments and provide adequate liquidity to fund other needs, including repayment of the May 2018 debt maturity and 2018 stock repurchaces, no assurances can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Company's future needs.
During 2018, the Company plans to focus its capital spending primarily on oil drilling activities in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area of the Permian Basin. The Company's 2018 capital budget totals $2.9 billion (excluding acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest, geological and geophysical administrative costs and information technology systems upgrades), consisting of $2.6 billion for drilling and completion related activities, including additional tank batteries, saltwater disposal facilities and gas processing facilities, and $260 million for water infrastructure, vertical integration, field facilities and vehicles. Based on the Company's current Management Price Outlooks, Pioneer expects its net cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments and, if necessary, availability under the Company's credit facility or proceeds from divestitures of nonstrategic assets to be sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures, dividend payments and provide adequate liquidity to fund other needs.
Investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities during 2017 was $1.8 billion, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net cash flow used in investing activities during 2017, as compared to 2016, is primarily due to (i) a decrease of $1.8 billion in net purchases of investments (commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits), (ii) a $563 million increase in proceeds from investments and (iii) the purchase of 28,000 net acres in the Permian Basin, with net production of approximately 1,400 BOEPD, from an unaffiliated third party for $428 million in 2016, partially offset by (iv) a $508 million increase in additions to oil and gas properties, (v) a $155 million decrease in proceeds from the disposition of assets and (v) a $133 million increase in additions to other assets and other property and equipment. Proceeds from the disposition of assets during 2017 included $264 million associated with the sale of approximately 20,500 acres in the Martin County region of the Permian Basin with net production of approximately1,500 BOEPD. Proceeds from the disposition of assets during 2016 included $501 million associated with the sale of EFS Midstream. The Company's investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily funded by net cash provided by operating activities.
 The increase in net cash flow used in investing activities during 2016, as compared to 2015, is primarily due to (i) net purchases of $1.8 billion of investments (commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits), (ii) the purchase of the aforementioned 28,000 net acres in the Permian Basin from an unaffiliated third party for $428 million in 2016 and (iii) a $46 million decrease in proceeds from the disposition of assets, partially offset by (iv) a $253 million decrease in additions to oil and gas properties and (v) an $80 million decrease in additions to other assets and other property and equipment. Proceeds from the

disposition of assets during 2016 and 2015 included $501 million and $530 million, respectively, associated with the sale of EFS Midstream. The Company's investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily funded by net cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and the Company's issuance of 19.8 million shares of common stock during 2016 for cash proceeds of $2.5 billion.
Dividends/distributions. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Board declared semiannual dividends of $0.04 per common share. Associated therewith, the Company paid $14 million, $13 million and $12 million, respectively, of aggregate dividends. In addition, in February 2018, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per share on Pioneer's outstanding common stock, payable April 12, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 29, 2018. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, and, if declared, the Board may change the dividend amount based on the Company's liquidity and capital resources at that time.
Off-balance sheet arrangements. From time to time, the Company enters into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2017, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company had entered into included (i) operating lease agreements, (ii) drilling commitments, (iii) firm purchase, transportation and fractionation commitments, (iv) open purchase commitments and (v) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable. The contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable include (i) derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices or interest rates, (ii) gathering, processing (primarily treating and fractionation) and transportation commitments on uncertain volumes of future throughput, (iii) open purchase commitments and (iv) indemnification obligations following certain divestitures. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. The Company expects to enter into similar contractual arrangements in the future, including incremental derivative contracts and additional firm purchase and transportation arrangements, in order to support the Company's business plans. See "Contractual obligations" below and Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information regarding the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements.
Contractual obligations. The Company's contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments (primarily related to commitments to pay day rates for contracted drilling rigs), capital funding obligations, derivative obligations, firm transportation and fractionation commitments, minimum annual gathering, processing and transportation commitments and other liabilities (including postretirement benefit obligations). Other joint owners in the properties operated by the Company will incur portions of the costs represented by these commitments.
The following table summarizes by period the payments due by the Company for contractual obligations estimated as of December 31, 2017:

(d) Derivative obligations represent net liabilities determined in accordance with master netting arrangements for commodity derivatives that were valued as of December 31, 2017. The Company's commodity derivative contracts are periodically measured and recorded at fair value and continue to be subject to market and credit risk. The ultimate liquidation value of the Company's commodity derivatives will be dependent upon actual future commodity prices, which may differ materially from the inputs used to determine the derivatives' fair values as of December 31, 2017. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's derivative obligations.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) Open purchase commitments primarily represent expenditure commitments for inventory, materials and other property and equipment ordered, but not received, as of December 31, 2017.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(f) The Company's other liabilities represent current and noncurrent other liabilities that are comprised of postretirement benefit obligations, litigation and environmental contingencies, asset retirement obligations and other obligations for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance. See Notes H, I and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's postretirement benefit obligations, asset retirement obligations and litigation and environmental contingencies, respectively.

(g) Firm purchase, gathering, processing, transportation and fractionation commitments represent take-or-pay agreements, which include (i) contractual commitments to purchase sand and water for use in the Company's drilling operations and (ii) estimated fees on production throughput commitments and demand fees associated with volume delivery commitments. The Company does not expect to be able to fulfill all of its short-term and long-term volume delivery obligations from projected production of available reserves; consequently, the Company plans to purchase third party volumes to satisfy its commitments if it is economic to do so; otherwise, it will pay demand fees for any commitment shortfalls. See "Item 2. Properties" and Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's firm purchase, gathering, processing, transportation and fractionation commitments.

Capital resources. The Company's primary capital resources are cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by operating activities, sales of short-term and long-term investments, proceeds from divestitures and proceeds from financing activities (principally borrowings under the Company's credit facility or issuances of debt or equity securities). If internal cash flows do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may reduce its level of capital expenditures, and/or fund a portion of its capital expenditures (i) by using cash on hand, (ii) through sales of short-term and long-term investments, (iii) with borrowings under the Company's credit facility, (iv) through issuances of debt or equity securities or (v) through other sources, such as sales of nonstrategic assets.
Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $2.1 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to increases in the Company's oil and gas revenues in 2017 as a result of increases in commodity prices and sales volumes, partially offset by a $613 million reduction in cash provided by commodity derivatives during 2017. The increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities in 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to increases in the Company's oil and gas revenues in 2016 as a result of increased sales volumes (partially offset by decreases in oil and gas prices), reductions in operating costs and a decrease in funds used to satisfy working capital obligations.
Asset divestitures. In February 2018, the Company announced its intention to divest its properties in South Texas, Raton and the West Panhandle field and focus its efforts and capital resources to its Permian Basin assets. No assurance can be given that the sales will be completed in accordance with the Company's plans or on terms and at prices acceptable to the Company.
In April 2017, the Company completed the sale of approximately 20,500 acres in the Martin County region of the Permian Basin to an unaffiliated third party for cash proceeds of $264 million. The sale resulted in a gain of $194 million. In conjunction with the divestiture, the Company reduced the carrying value of goodwill by $2 million, reflecting the portion of the Company's goodwill related to the assets sold.
In July 2015, the Company completed the sale of its 50.1 percent interest in EFS Midstream to an unaffiliated third party, with the Company receiving total consideration of $1.0 billion, of which $530 million was received at closing and the remaining $501 million was received in July 2016.
See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information regarding the Company's asset divestitures.

Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities during 2017 was $529 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities during 2016 and 2015 of $2.0 billion and $951 million, respectively. The following provides a description of the Company's significant financing activities during 2017, 2016 and 2015:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During March 2017, the Company repaid $485 million associated with the maturity of the Company's 6.65% senior notes;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During July 2016, the Company repaid $455 million associated with the maturity of the Company's 5.875% senior notes;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During June 2016, the Company completed the sale of 6.0 million shares of its common stock at a per-share price, after underwriter discounts and offering expenses, of $155.27, resulting in $937 million of net cash proceeds;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During January 2016, the Company completed the sale of 13.8 million shares of its common stock at a per-share price, after underwriter discounts and offering expenses, of $115.78, resulting in $1.6 billion of net cash proceeds;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During December 2015, the Company issued $500 million of 3.45% Senior Notes due 2021 and $500 million of 4.45% Senior Notes due 2026 and received combined proceeds, net of $9 million of underwriter discounts and offering expenses, of $991 million; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During August 2015, the Company amended its credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions to extend its maturity to August 2020, while maintaining aggregate loan commitments of $1.5 billion.

See Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the significant debt financing activities.
As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The Company cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of any such actions as they are subject to market conditions, among other factors. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Board.
Liquidity. The Company's principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by operating activities, sales of short-term and long-term investments, proceeds from divestitures and unused borrowing capacity under its credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its Credit Facility, leaving $1.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. The Company's credit facility contains certain financial covenants, which include the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization, subject to certain adjustments, not to exceed .60:1, which is above the Company's December 31, 2017 ratio of .16:1. The Company also had cash on hand of $896 million, short-term investments of $1.2 billion and long-term investments of $66 million as of December 31, 2017. If internal cash flows do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may fund a portion of its capital expenditures using cash on hand, through sales of short-term and long-term investments, availability under its credit facility, issuances of debt or equity securities or other sources, such as sales of nonstrategic assets, and/or reduce its level of capital expenditures or reduce dividend payments. The Company cannot provide any assurance that needed short-term or long-term liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Although the Company expects that the combination of internal operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments and, if necessary, available capacity under the Company's credit facility will be adequate to fund 2018 capital expenditures, dividend payments and provide adequate liquidity to fund other needs, including repayment of the May 2018 debt maturity and 2018 stock repurchases, no assurances can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Company's future needs.
Debt ratings. The Company is rated as mid-investment grade by three credit rating agencies. The Company receives debt credit ratings from several of the major ratings agencies, which are subject to regular reviews. The Company believes that each of the rating agencies considers many factors in determining the Company's ratings, including: (i) production growth opportunities, (ii) liquidity, (iii) debt levels, (iv) asset composition and (v) proved reserve mix. A reduction in the Company's debt ratings could increase the interest rates that the Company incurs on Credit Facility borrowings and could negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing.
Book capitalization and current ratio. The Company's net book capitalization at December 31, 2017 was $11.8 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $896 million, short-term and long-term investments of $1.3 billion, debt of $2.7 billion and equity of $11.3 billion. The Company's net debt to book capitalization increased to five percent at December 31, 2017 from two percent at December 31, 2016, primarily due to funding the Company's oil and gas drilling and other property investments with cash and cash equivalents and sales of short-term and long-term investments. The Company's ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to 1.41:1 at December 31, 2017, as compared to 2.11:1 at December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable as a result of the Company's higher drilling and completion related activities in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this Report in accordance with GAAP. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for a comprehensive discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies. GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. The following is a discussion of the Company's most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the Company's application of GAAP.
Asset retirement obligations. The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to restore the land at the end of oil and gas production operations. The Company's removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires

60

Table of Contents
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.
Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations, a corresponding adjustment is generally made to the oil and gas property balance. See Notes B and I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's asset retirement obligations.
Successful efforts method of accounting. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. In general, the Company believes that net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method, particularly during periods of active exploration. The critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method, exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting, such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment, geological and geophysical expense of $106 million, $119 million and $99 million, respectively.
Proved reserve estimates. Estimates of the Company's proved reserves included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:

- -------------------------------------------
• the quality and quantity of available data;

- --------------------------------
• the interpretation of that data;

- ----------------------------------------------------------
• the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and

- ---------------------------------------------------
• the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.

The Company's proved reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was prepared by the Company's engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Company's major properties. Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, proved reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify, positively or negatively, material revisions to the estimate of proved reserves.
It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this Report as of December 31, 2017 is the current market value of the Company's estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the 2017 Standardized Measure on a twelve month average of commodity prices on the first day of the month and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors," "Item 2. Properties" and Supplementary Information included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves.
The Company's estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the Company records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower commodity prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Company's assessment of its proved properties and goodwill for impairment.
Impairment of proved oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its proved properties to be held and used whenever management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon estimated future recoverable proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, Management's Price Outlooks, production and capital costs expected to be incurred to recover the reserves, discount rates commensurate with the nature of the properties and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties. Proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated. See Notes B and D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the Company's impairment assessments.

61

Table of Contents
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY

Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties. At December 31, 2017, the Company carried unproved property costs of $558 million. Management assesses unproved oil and gas properties for impairment on a project-by-project basis. Management's impairment assessments include evaluating the results of exploration activities, Management's Price Outlooks and planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects.
Suspended wells. The Company suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the discovery. The ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions. If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields, the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonment expense.
The Company does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory well as an asset in its consolidated balance sheets following the completion of drilling unless both of the following conditions are met:

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i) The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well; and

---- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.

Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain projects, it may take an extended period of time to evaluate the future potential of an exploration project and economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability. In these instances, the project's feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Company's ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies' production, transportation or processing facilities and/or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly. Consequently, the Company's assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves to sanction the project or is noncommercial and is impaired. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's suspended exploratory well costs.
Deferred tax asset valuation allowances. The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company-specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period.
Uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $124 million and $112 million, respectively, resulting from research and experimental expenditures related to horizontal drilling and completion innovations. If all or a portion of the unrecognized tax benefit is sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, the tax benefit will be recognized as a reduction to the Company's deferred tax liability and will affect the Company's effective tax rate in the period it is recognized. See Note O of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding uncertain tax positions.
Goodwill impairment. The Company reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually. During the third quarters of 2017 and 2016, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill to assess whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Company's reporting unit was less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it was necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The Company determined that it was more likely than not that the Company's goodwill was not impaired. There is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values, particularly in determining the valuation methodologies to utilize, the estimation of proved reserves as described above and the weighting of different valuation methodologies applied. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding goodwill and assessments of goodwill for impairment.
Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons. The costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations, developing information relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. A liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information regarding the Company's commitments and contingencies.

Valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company calculates the fair value of stock-based compensation using various valuation methods. The valuation methods require the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value. The Company utilizes (i) the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, (ii) the closing stock price on the day prior to the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards, (iii) the closing stock price on the balance sheet date for restricted stock awards that are expected to be settled wholly or partially in cash on their vesting date and (iv) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the Company's stock-based compensation.
Valuation of other assets and liabilities at fair value. The Company periodically measures and records certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The assets and liabilities that the Company measures and records at fair value on a recurring basis include trading securities, commodity derivative contracts and interest rate contracts. Other assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. The assets and liabilities that the Company measures and records at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include inventory, proved and unproved oil and gas properties, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations and other long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired or held for sale. The Company also measures and discloses certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, such as long-term debt and investments. The valuation methods used by the Company to measure the fair values of these assets and liabilities may require considerable management judgment and estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value estimates, such as future prices, credit-adjusted risk-free rates and current volatility factors. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for information regarding the methods used by management to estimate the fair values of these assets and liabilities.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...
