Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Executive Overview
We are focused on the ownership, management, redevelopment and limited development of quality apartment communities located in some of the largest markets in the United States.
Our principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our equity holders. We measure our current return using Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, and our long-term total return using Economic Income. In 2017, AFFO grew by 7.6% to $2.12 per share. Over the last five years, our Economic Income grew at a compound annual return of 13.7%, comprised of 10.6% compounded annual growth in net asset value, or NAV, per share and $5.78 in cash dividends per share paid over the period. We also use Pro forma Funds From Operations, or Pro forma FFO, as a measure of operational performance. Economic Income, NAV, AFFO, and Pro forma FFO are non-GAAP measures and are defined under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.
Our business and five areas of strategic focus are described in more detail within the Business Overview in Item 1. The results from execution of our business plan in 2017 are further described in the sections that follow.
Net income attributable to common stockholders per common share decreased by $0.71 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily due to lower gains on the sale of apartment communities and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by increased contribution from property net operating income more fully described below.
Pro forma FFO per share increased $0.13, or 5.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016. The primary driver of this increase was property net operating income growth of $0.11 per share, consisting of:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $0.10 from Same Store property net operating income growth of 4.2%, driven primarily by a 3.2% increase in revenue and almost flat expense growth;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $0.12 from the lease-up over the last 12 months of more than 800 renovated homes at redevelopment communities and completion of the lease-up of One Canal in Boston, and Indigo in Redwood City, California; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $0.02 from our Other Real Estate apartment communities, primarily due to rate increases; partially offset by

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $0.13 lower property net operating income from apartment communities sold in 2016 to fund redevelopment and development activities and acquisitions.

As compared to 2016, lower interest rates, higher tax benefit, higher transactional income and other factors, partially offset by lower deferred tax credit income, contributed an additional $0.02 to Pro forma FFO per share.
The $0.13 increase in year-over-year Pro forma FFO per share plus $0.02 in lower capital replacement spending due to fewer apartment homes increased AFFO by $0.15, or 7.6% per share.
Operational Excellence
We own and operate a portfolio of market rate apartment communities diversified by both geography and price point. At December 31, 2017, our Real Estate portfolio included 136 apartment communities with 36,904 apartment homes in which we held an average ownership of approximately 99%.
Our property operations team delivered solid results for our Real Estate portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2017. Highlights include:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Same Store net operating income growth greater than 4% for the seventh year in a row;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Same Store rent increases on renewals and new leases averaged 4.6% and 0.6%, respectively, for a weighted average increase of 2.5%; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Completion of the lease-up of One Canal in Boston, and Indigo in Redwood City, California.

Our focus on efficient operations through productivity initiatives such as centralization of administrative tasks, optimization of economies of scale at the corporate level, and investment in more durable, longer-lived materials has helped us control operating expenses. As a result of these efforts, our Same Store controllable operating expenses, which we define as property operating expenses before real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, decreased by 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The compounded annual growth rate for Same Store controllable operating expenses for the past decade is negative 0.4%.
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Real Estate portfolio provided 69% net operating income margins and 64% Free Cash Flow margins. Free Cash Flow is defined under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.
In addition to those communities in our Real Estate portfolio, as of December 31, 2017, we held nominal ownership positions (generally less than 1%) in partnerships that own 46 low-income housing tax credit communities with 6,898 apartment homes. We provide asset management and other services to these partnerships and receive fees and other payments in return. Our relationship with these partnerships is different than real estate ownership and is better described as an Asset Management business. We have limited upside or downside exposure. In accordance with GAAP, we consolidate most of these partnerships and communities, thus reflecting their operating results as though they were our own until our fee and other interests have been repaid, generally upon sale of the underlying communities.

 Redevelopment
Our second line of business is the redevelopment and development of apartment communities where we create value equal to 25% to 35% of our incremental investment by repositioning communities within the Aimco portfolio and by constructing new communities. We measure the rate and quality of financial returns by Net Asset Value creation, an important component of Economic Income, our primary measure of long-term financial performance. We invest to earn risk-adjusted returns in excess of those expected from the apartment communities sold in paired trades to fund the redevelopment or development.
We also undertake ground-up development when warranted by risk-adjusted investment returns, either directly in connection with the redevelopment of an existing apartment community or, on a more limited basis, at a new location. When warranted, we rely on the expertise and credit of a third-party developer familiar with the local market to limit our exposure to construction risk.
Of these two activities, we favor redevelopment because it permits adjustment of the scope and timing of spending to align with changing market conditions and customer preferences.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we invested $172.4 million primarily in our ongoing redevelopment and development projects.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed construction on the third tower of Park Towne Place in Center City, Philadelphia. As of December 31, 2017, the first three towers combined were 89% leased with approximately 40 homes remaining to be leased at the third redeveloped tower to reach occupancy stabilization. Based on these results, we decided to proceed with a $40 million redevelopment of the fourth and final tower. We have completed de-leasing and commenced construction on this tower, and lease-up is scheduled to commence in the spring of 2018.
We have planned and entitled a new $117.0 million, 226 apartment home community to be known as Parc Mosaic, located in Boulder, Colorado on the site of our Eastpointe community. As part of this plan, as of December 31, 2017, we completed the de-leasing of Eastpointe and commenced demolition and construction. The site is two miles from the new Google campus and is across the street from Ball Aerospace’s Technology Campus and Foothills Hospital. Building in Boulder is highly regulated and new supply is limited, notwithstanding higher enrollment at the University of Colorado and increased employment generally.
Inclusive of these two new projects, our total estimated net investment in redevelopment and development activities is $714.6 million, with a projected weighted average net operating income yield on these investments of 6.1%, assuming untrended rents. As of December 31, 2017, $513.1 million of this total has been funded.
During 2017, we leased over 800 apartment homes at our redevelopment communities. As of December 31, 2017, our lease-up exposure at active redevelopment and development projects included approximately 611 apartment homes, of which 232 were in the fourth tower of Park Towne Place, which we expect to be available for lease beginning in the summer of 2018 and 215 were in Parc Mosaic, which we expect to be available for lease beginning in the summer of 2019.
See below under the Liquidity and Capital Resources – Redevelopment/Development heading for additional information regarding our redevelopment and development investment during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Portfolio Management
Our portfolio of apartment communities is diversified across “A,” “B,” and “C+” price points, averaging “B/B+” in quality and is diversified across some of the largest markets in the U.S. We measure the quality of apartment communities in our Real Estate portfolio based on average rents of our apartment homes compared to local market average rents as reported by a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance and analysis. Under this rating system, we classify as “A” quality apartment communities those earning rents greater than 125% of the local market average, as “B” quality apartment communities those earning rents between 90% and 125% of the local market average; as “C+” quality apartment communities those earning rents greater than $1,100 per month, but lower than 90% of local market average; and as “C” quality apartment communities those earning rents less than $1,100 per month and lower than 90% of local market average. We classify as “B/B+” quality a portfolio that on average earns rents between 100% and 125% of the local market average rents where the portfolio is located. Although some companies and analysts within the multifamily real estate industry use apartment community quality ratings of “A,” “B,” and “C,” some of which are tied to local market rent averages, the metrics used to classify apartment community quality as well as the period for which local market rents are calculated may vary from company to company. Accordingly, our rating system for measuring apartment community quality is neither broadly nor consistently used in the multifamily real estate industry.
 As part of our portfolio strategy, we seek to sell up to 10% of our portfolio annually and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in accretive uses such as capital enhancements, redevelopments, occasional developments, and selective acquisitions with projected Free Cash Flow internal rates of return higher than expected from the communities being sold. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, we have significantly increased the quality and expected growth rate of our portfolio, resulting in a compound annual growth rate in average revenue per Aimco apartment home of 8.8% over the last three years.

The quality of our portfolio improved through value created by our redevelopment and transaction activities, contributing to the increase in average revenue per apartment home. The increase is due to rent growth from the improved quality of our portfolio, driven in part by the sale of apartment communities with average monthly revenues per Aimco apartment home lower than those of the retained portfolio, and also by our reinvestment of the sales proceeds through redevelopment, development and acquisition of apartment communities with higher rents and better free cash flow return prospects than the apartment communities sold.
As we execute our portfolio strategy, we expect to increase average revenue per Aimco apartment home for our Real Estate portfolio at a rate greater than market rent growth; increase free cash flow margins; and maintain sufficient geographic and price point diversification to moderate volatility and concentration risk.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold five apartment communities with 2,291 apartment homes for a gain of $297.9 million and gross proceeds of $397.0 million resulting in net proceeds of $381.1 million. Two of these apartment communities were affordable communities located in Washington, DC and Philadelphia, and three were located in southern New Jersey and southern Virginia.
In January 2018, we agreed to sell our interests in the entities owning the La Jolla Cove property in settlement of legal actions filed in 2014 by a group of disappointed buyers who had hoped to acquire the property. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a gross impairment loss of $35.8 million in our 2017 results, $25.6 million of which relates to the establishment of a deferred tax liability assumed in connection with our acquisition of the business entities. Upon closing of the transaction, the tax liability will be assumed by the buyer, resulting in no economic loss. The remaining $10.2 million loss is offset by cash distributions we received during our ownership and avoided legal costs for continued litigation. On an economic basis, we agreed to sell these entities at roughly our purchase price, adjusted for retained cash distributions and avoided legal costs.
Also in January 2018, we sold three additional apartment communities with 513 apartment homes for a gain of approximately $50.0 million, net of tax, and gross proceeds of $71.9 million, resulting in $64.6 million in net proceeds. Two of these communities are located in southern Virginia and one is located in suburban Maryland.
Proceeds from the 2017 and 2018 sales were used to repay outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility, effectively funding the equity portion of the Palazzo reacquisition, as further discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, as well as our 2017 redevelopment and development activities.

Balance Sheet
We target net leverage of $3.8 billion. At December 31, 2017, our leverage of $3.9 billion was above this target due to the timing of the three apartment community sales discussed above that closed in January 2018.
Our leverage includes our share of long-term, non-recourse property debt encumbering apartment communities in our Real Estate portfolio, our term loan, outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and outstanding preferred equity. In our calculation of leverage, we exclude non-recourse property debt obligations of consolidated partnerships served by our Asset Management business, as these are not our obligations and they have limited effect on the amount of fees and other amounts we expect to receive in our role as asset manager for these partnerships.
Our leverage strategy seeks to increase financial returns while using leverage with appropriate caution. We limit risk through balance sheet structure, employing low leverage, primarily non-recourse and long-dated property debt; build financial flexibility by maintaining ample unused and available credit as well as holding properties with substantial value unencumbered by property debt; and use partners’ capital when it enhances financial returns or reduces investment risk.
We target the ratio of Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA to be below 7.0x and we target the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends to be greater than 2.5x.
Proportionate Debt, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Interest Expense, as used in these ratios, are non-GAAP financial measures, which are further discussed and reconciled under the Non-GAAP Measures – Leverage Ratios heading. Preferred Equity represents Aimco’s preferred stock and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s preferred OP Units. Our leverage ratios for the three months ended December 31, 2017, are presented below:

-------------------------------------------------------------------- ----

Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 6.5x
Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA 6.9x
Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense 3.3x
Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends 3.1x

23

Table of Contents

We calculate our leverage ratios based on the most recent three month amounts, annualized. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA in our leverage ratios has been adjusted on a pro forma basis to reflect the disposition of five apartment communities during the period as if the sales had closed on October 1, 2017. The effect of this pro forma adjustment may be found in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation under the Non-GAAP Measures heading.
During 2017, we closed or rate-locked nine fixed-rate, non-recourse, amortizing, property loans totaling $550.8 million. On a weighted basis, the term of these loans averaged 9.1 years and their interest rates averaged 3.48%, 123 basis points above the corresponding treasury rates at the time of pricing.
Also during 2017, we restructured five fixed-rate, non-recourse, amortizing, property loans totaling $17.4 million, extending their maturity dates from 2018 to 2023 and reducing their weighted average interest rate from 4.13% to 3.63%.
The net effect of 2017 property debt refinancing activities has been to lower our weighted average fixed interest rates by about 20 basis points to 4.64%, generating prospective annual interest savings of approximately $6.6 million.
Our liquidity consists of cash balances and available capacity on our revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2017, we had on hand $616.6 million of cash and restricted cash plus available capacity on our revolving line of credit.
We also manage our financial flexibility by maintaining an investment grade rating and holding apartment communities that are unencumbered by property debt. At December 31, 2017, we held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $1.8 billion, up 12.5% year-over-year.
Two credit rating agencies rate our creditworthiness, using different methodologies and ratios for assessing our credit, and both have rated our credit and outlook as BBB- (stable), an investment grade rating. Although some of the ratios they use are similar to those we use to measure our leverage, there are differences in our methods of calculation and therefore our leverage ratios disclosed above are not indicative of the ratios that may be calculated by these agencies.
For additional information regarding our leverage, please see the discussion under the Liquidity and Capital Resources heading.

Team and Culture
Our team and culture are keys to our success. Our intentional focus on a collaborative and productive culture based on respect for others and personal responsibility is reinforced by a preference for promotion from within based on succession planning and talent development to produce a strong, stable team that is the enduring foundation of our success. In 2017, Aimco was recognized by the Denver Post as a Top Work Place. We are one of only a dozen Colorado companies of all sizes that have earned this designation for five consecutive years.
Key Financial Indicators
The key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our operating performance are Economic Income, our measure of total return, and Adjusted Funds From Operations, our measure of current return. In addition to these indicators, we evaluate our operating performance and financial condition using: Pro forma Funds From Operations; FCF; same store property operating results; proportionate property net operating income; average revenue per effective apartment home; leverage ratios; and net leverage. Certain of these financial indicators are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined, further described and, for certain of the measures, reconciled to comparable GAAP-based measures under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.

Results of Operations

Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our apartment communities, the supply of and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our apartment communities and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment communities affect our operating results.
The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Overview
2017 compared to 2016
Net income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership decreased by $114.6 million and $120.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease in income was

24

Table of Contents

principally due to a decrease in gain on dispositions of real estate and an increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from redeveloped apartment homes placed into service and the completion of One Canal and the acquisition of Indigo in 2016, partially offset by improved operating results as further described below.

2016 compared to 2015
Net income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership increased by $181.7 million and $190.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in income was principally due to an increase in gain on dispositions of real estate, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from redeveloped apartment homes placed into service and the completion of One Canal and the acquisition of Indigo in 2016.
The following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of operations of Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership in more detail.
Property Operations
As described under the preceding Executive Overview heading, our Real Estate segment consists primarily of market rate apartment communities in which we hold a substantial equity ownership interest.
We use proportionate property net operating income to assess the operating performance of our Real Estate portfolio. Proportionate property net operating income reflects our share of rental and other property revenues less direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes, for consolidated apartment communities we manage. Accordingly, the results of operations of our Real Estate segment discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis and exclude the results of four apartment communities with 142 apartment homes that we neither manage nor consolidate.
We do not include offsite costs associated with property management or casualty-related amounts in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below. Refer to Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our reportable segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses.
Real Estate Proportionate Property Net Operating Income
We classify apartment communities within our Real Estate segment as Same Store and Other Real Estate. Same Store communities are those that have reached a stabilized level of operations as of the beginning of a two-year comparable period and maintained it throughout the current and comparable prior year, and are not expected to be sold within 12 months. Other Real Estate includes apartment communities that do not meet the Same Store definition, including, but not limited to: redevelopment and development apartment communities, which are those currently under construction that have not achieved a stabilized level of operations and those that have been completed in recent years that have not achieved and maintained stabilized operations for both the current and comparable prior year; acquisition apartment communities, which are those we have acquired since the beginning of a two-year comparable period; and communities that we expect to sell within 12 months but do not yet meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
As of December 31, 2017, as defined by our segment performance metrics, our Real Estate segment consisted of 92 Same Store communities with 26,386 apartment homes and 37 Other Real Estate communities with 9,863 apartment homes.
From December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, on a net basis, our Same Store portfolio decreased by nine communities and decreased by 4,507 apartment homes. These changes consisted of:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the addition of three redeveloped apartment communities with 974 apartment homes that were classified as Same Store upon maintaining stabilized operations for the entirety of both periods presented;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the addition of one acquired apartment community with 94 apartment homes that was classified as Same Store because we have now owned it for the entirety of both periods presented;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the reduction of five apartment communities with 2,460 apartment homes for which we commenced redevelopment during the period;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the reduction of two apartment communities with 906 apartment homes we expected to sell during 2017;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the reduction of three apartment communities with 1,696 apartment homes sold during the period; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the reduction of three apartment communities with 513 apartment homes held for sale.

Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2017, our Other Real Estate communities included:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• 15 apartment communities with 6,386 apartment homes in redevelopment or development;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------
• 2 apartment communities with 578 apartment homes recently acquired;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• 4 apartment communities with 604 apartment homes owned that receive forms of government rental assistance; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• 16 apartment communities with 2,295 apartment homes that do not meet the definition of Same Store because they are either subject to agreements that limit the amount by which we may increase rents or have not reached or maintained a stabilized level of occupancy as of the beginning of a two-year comparable period, often due to a casualty event.

Prior to 2017, five of the Other Real Estate communities were classified as part of our former Affordable segment. The results of operations for these communities are reflected in the comparable periods in the tables below.
Our Real Estate segment results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, as presented below, are based on the apartment community classifications as of December 31, 2017.

For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, our Real Estate segment’s proportionate property net operating income increased $49.4 million, or 9.1%.
Same Store proportionate property net operating income increased by $16.8 million, or 4.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to an $18.0 million, or 3.2%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues ($59 per effective home), comprised primarily of increases in rental rates. Renewal rents (the rent paid by an existing resident who renewed her lease compared to the rent she previously paid) were up 4.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, and new lease rents (the rent paid by a new resident compared to the rent paid by the previous resident of the same apartment home) were up 0.6%, resulting in a weighted average increase of 2.5%. The increase in Same Store rental and other property revenues was partially offset by a $1.2 million, or 0.7%, increase in property operating expenses, primarily due to increases in real estate taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, controllable operating expenses, which exclude utility costs, real estate taxes and insurance, decreased by $1.0 million, or 1.3%.
The proportionate property net operating income of Other Real Estate communities increased by $32.5 million, or 23.8%, due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• redevelopment and lease-up activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, which helped contribute to incremental property net operating income of $20.9 million compared to 2016; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher property net operating income of $11.6 million from other communities, including the effect of our increased ownership interest in the Palazzo communities from our June 2017 reacquisition of the 47% limited partner interest in the related joint venture.

This increase was primarily attributable to a $27.5 million, or 4.8%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues ($85 per effective home), comprised primarily of increases in rental rates. Renewal rents (the rent paid by an existing resident who renewed her lease compared to the rent she previously paid) were up 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, and new lease rents (the rent paid by a new resident compared to the rent paid by the previous resident of the same apartment home) were up 2.4%, resulting in a weighted average increase of 4.0%. The increase in Same Store rental and other property revenues was partially offset by a $1.9 million, or 1.1%, increase in property operating expenses, primarily due to increases in real estate taxes, personnel costs and repairs and maintenance, partially offset by lower utilities expenses and insurance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, controllable operating expenses, which exclude utility costs, real estate taxes and insurance, increased by $1.4 million, or 1.7%.
The proportionate property net operating income of Other Real Estate communities increased by $18.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. This increase is attributable to the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $7.8 million increase due to the net operating income stabilization of three redeveloped communities;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $3.7 million due to lease-up activities at acquired and redeveloped apartment communities, partially offset by decreases due to apartment homes taken out of service for redevelopment; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $6.5 million from other communities, including apartment communities we acquired in 2015 and market rate increases at four apartment communities that were approved in 2016 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Non-Segment Real Estate Operations
Operating income amounts not attributed to our Real Estate segment include offsite costs associated with property management, casualty losses, and the results of apartment communities sold or held for sale, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our Real Estate segment for purposes of evaluating segment performance (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, casualty losses totaled $8.2 million, $5.6 million and $7.0 million, respectively. Casualty losses were elevated during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to hurricane damage. Casualty losses were elevated during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to losses resulting from property damage and snow removal costs associated with the severe snow storms in the Northeast.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, apartment communities previously in our Real Estate portfolio that were sold or classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2017 generated net operating income of $26.5 million, $46.8 million and $68.8 million, respectively.

Asset Management Results
As further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we provide asset management and other services to certain consolidated partnerships that own apartment communities that qualify for low-income housing tax credits and are structured to provide for the pass-through of tax credits and tax deductions to their partners.
Contribution from Asset Management included in our consolidated financial statements includes: fees and other amounts paid to us from the net operating income of partnerships served by our Asset Management business less interest expense incurred on non-recourse property debt obligations of the partnerships; income associated with delivery of tax credits to the third-party investors in the partnerships (including amounts received during the period and amounts received in previous periods); and transactional revenue and other income less asset management expenses (including certain allocated offsite costs related to the operation of this business).
The contribution from Asset Management for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is presented in the table below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ ---- ------- ---- ------ ------- - - ------

 Year Ended December 31,
(in thousands) 2017 2016 2015
Net operating income of partnerships served by the Asset Management business $ 43,745 $ 43,161 $ 41,887
Interest expense on non-recourse property debt of partnerships (13,031 ) (13,387 ) (12,984 )
Amount available for payment of Asset Management fees 30,714 29,774 28,903
Tax credit income, net 10,049 16,546 22,819
Asset management expenses (5,934 ) (5,804 ) (6,770 )
Transactional revenue and other income 5,208 8,290 3,146
Contribution from the Asset Management business $ 40,037 $ 48,806 $ 48,098

For the periods presented above, the contribution from the Asset Management business fluctuated for the reasons discussed below.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increases in the amount available for payment of Asset Management fees generated by the partnerships were primarily attributed to increases in rental income due to higher rates, partially offset by the loss of net operating income from communities sold and higher operating expenses, including personnel and repairs and maintenance costs.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Tax credit income, net, decreased primarily due to the delivery of substantially all of the tax credits on various partnerships and our 2016 acquisition of an investor limited partner’s interest in one of the tax credit partnerships (and their rights to undelivered tax credits) prior to the end of the tax credit delivery period. Following the purchase, we recognized tax benefits in our results of operations, which largely offset the tax credit income we otherwise would have recognized.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Transactional revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $2.4 million in fees earned in connection with the disposition of real estate and for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a $3.6 million fee earned for assisting a third-party property owner in a mark-up-to-market renewal related to an affordable community we previously owned. Other income, for each of the years presented, includes results related to the Napico business, which is further described under the Other, net heading below.

28

Table of Contents

We expect the contribution to our net income from the Asset Management business to decline in future years as we continue to deliver the final tax credits for these partnerships and, as part of our plan to exit the Asset Management business, the partnerships sell the underlying apartment communities.
Depreciation and Amortization
For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $33.1 million primarily due to renovated apartment homes placed in service after their completion, a full year of depreciation following the 2016 completion of our One Canal development and 2016 acquisition of Indigo, and other capital additions, partially offset by decreases associated with apartment communities sold.
For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $26.8 million primarily due to renovated apartment homes placed in service after their completion, the completion of our One Canal and Vivo developments, and our 2016 acquisition of Indigo and other capital additions, partially offset by decreases associated with apartment communities sold.
General and Administrative Expenses
In recent years, we have worked toward simplifying our business, which allowed us to reduce overhead and other costs. This simplification and our scale reductions have allowed us to reduce our offsite costs, which consist of general and administrative expenses, property management expenses and investment management expenses, by $11.6 million, or 15.1%, over the last three years.
For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.1 million, primarily due to lower personnel and related costs including incentive compensation, professional services, technology costs and other corporate costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, general and administrative expenses, excluding incentive compensation, decreased by approximately $0.2 million. Inclusive of incentive compensation, general and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million, primarily due to our performance against key performance indicators in 2016 as compared to 2015.
Other Expenses, Net
Other expenses, net includes franchise taxes, costs associated with our risk management activities, partnership administration expenses and certain non-recurring items.
For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, other expenses, net decreased by $2.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to the 2016 recognition of estimated future environmental clean-up and abatement costs associated with the matters discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, partially offset by legal costs we incurred related to a challenge to the title of a property we acquired in 2014.
 For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, other expenses, net increased by $3.9 million. The increase was primarily due to the 2016 environmental costs discussed above, partially offset by lower legal and related costs.
Provision for Real Estate Impairment Loss
In January 2018, we agreed to sell our interests in the entities owning the La Jolla Cove property in settlement of legal actions filed in 2014 by a group of disappointed buyers who had hoped to acquire the property. As a result of the settlement, we recognized in our 2017 results a gross impairment loss of $35.8 million, $25.6 million of which relates to the establishment of a deferred tax liability assumed in connection with our acquisition of the business entities. Upon closing of the transaction, the tax liability will be assumed by the buyer, resulting in no economic loss to Aimco. The remaining $10.2 million loss is offset by cash distributions paid to us during our ownership and avoided legal costs for continued litigation. On an economic basis, we agreed to sell these entities at roughly our purchase price, adjusted for retained cash distributions and avoided legal costs.
We recognized no provisions for impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.
Interest Expense
For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs and amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased by $1.8 million, or 0.9%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances on non-recourse property debt for our Real Estate apartment communities and lower interest rates, resulting in an $11.9 million reduction in interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher amounts outstanding on corporate borrowings (including our term loan and incremental line borrowings used to temporarily fund the reacquisition of

29

Table of Contents

the Palazzo limited partner interests) and a decrease in capitalized interest associated with our redevelopment and development activities.
For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, interest expense decreased by $3.3 million, or 1.7%. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower average outstanding balances from our repayment of non-recourse property debt and to a lesser extent from a lower average cost of debt on property loans refinanced during the year, resulting in an $8.1 million reduction in interest expense, and a $4.9 million reduction of interest expense on debt related to apartment community dispositions. These decreases were partially offset by increased interest expense on debt associated with apartment community acquisitions and on One Canal, the construction of which was completed during 2016 and for which we ceased interest capitalization, and higher average borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
Other, Net
Other, net includes our equity in the income or loss of unconsolidated real estate partnerships, and the results of operations related to the Napico business, which we accounted for under the profit sharing method prior to the derecognition of the final property during 2017.
For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, net income of the Napico business increased by $2.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, net income of the Napico business increased by $5.4 million. As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, in 2017 we derecognized the assets and liabilities related to the final Napico property, and in 2016 we partially derecognized the assets and liabilities of the Napico business, resulting in gains that contributed to the increase in other, net in both years.
Income Tax Benefit
Certain of our operations, including property management and risk management, are conducted through TRS entities. Additionally, some of our apartment communities are owned through TRS entities.
Our income tax benefit calculated in accordance with GAAP includes: (a) historic tax credits that offset income tax obligations of our TRS entities; (b) income taxes associated with the income or loss of our TRS entities, for which the tax consequences have been realized or will be realized in future periods; and (c) low income housing tax credits that offset REIT taxable income, primarily from retained capital gains. Income taxes related to these items (before gains on dispositions) are included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations.
Income tax benefit for the periods presented also reflects GAAP taxes associated with income and gains related to the Napico business, which was partially deconsolidated in 2016 and for which the final property was deconsolidated in 2017.
For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, income tax benefit increased by $6.9 million, from $25.2 million to $32.1 million. The increase is primarily due to higher tax benefit associated with low-income housing tax credits from our September 2016 acquisition of the limited partner interests in a tax credit partnership, higher net operating losses at the TRS entities (including the La Jolla Cove impairment loss discussed above) and the $0.5 million net tax benefit we recognized as a result of the December 2017 tax reform legislation (as further discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in historic tax credits associated with the redevelopment of certain apartment communities, including the timing of final certification on one redevelopment in 2016.
For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, income tax benefit decreased by $2.3 million, primarily due to lower net losses recognized by apartment communities owned by our TRS entities, partially offset by higher historic tax credits associated with the redevelopment of certain apartment communities and higher tax benefit associated with low-income housing tax credits from our acquisition of the limited partner interests in a tax credit partnership.

(1) Net proceeds are after repayment of debt, if any, net working capital settlements, payment of transaction costs and debt prepayment penalties, if applicable.

The apartment communities sold from our Real Estate portfolio during 2017, 2016 and 2015 were primarily located outside of our primary markets or in lower-rated locations within our primary markets and had average revenues per apartment home significantly below those of our retained portfolio.
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships
Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects the results of our consolidated real estate partnerships allocated to the owners who are not affiliated with Aimco. The amounts of income or loss of our consolidated real estate partnerships that we allocate to owners not affiliated with Aimco include their share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts that we charge to these partnerships.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we allocated net income of $9.1 million, $25.3 million, and $4.8 million, respectively, to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. The amount of net income allocated to noncontrolling interests was driven by three primary factors: the operations of the consolidated apartment communities; gains on the sale of apartment communities with noncontrolling interest holders; and the results of operations of the Napico business, as further discussed below.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The amount of net income allocated to noncontrolling interests resulting from operations of the consolidated apartment communities was $2.4 million, $4.4 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease from 2016 to 2017 is primarily due to the June 30, 2017 reacquisition of our limited partner’s interest in the Palazzo joint venture.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains on the sale of apartment communities allocated to noncontrolling interests totaled $7.3 million, $13.0 million and $6.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we derecognized the Napico business in two transactions, which occurred in 2016 and 2017. We allocated $8.1 million of the gain on sale and a $0.6 million net loss, respectively, to the noncontrolling interest holders in connection with the 2017 and 2016 transactions. In 2015, we allocated a net loss of $5.4 million to the noncontrolling interest holders from the results of Napico operations.

Net Income Attributable to Aimco Preferred Stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s Preferred Unitholders
Net income attributable to Aimco preferred stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s preferred unitholders decreased by $3.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. These decreases were primarily due to Aimco’s redemption of its Class Z Preferred Stock in 2016. In connection with the redemption, we wrote off previously deferred issuance costs of $1.3 million. Additionally, the $0.7 million excess of the redemption value over the

31

Table of Contents

carrying amount was reflected in the net income attributable to Aimco Preferred Stockholders and Aimco Operating Partnership’s Preferred Unitholders for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Net income attributable to Aimco preferred stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s preferred unitholders increased by $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. These increases were primarily due to Aimco’s redemption of its Class Z Preferred Stock described above, which resulted in $2.0 million of redemption related charges, partially offset by $1.1 million of lower dividends.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
Capitalized Costs
We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopments and developments, other tangible apartment community improvements and replacements of existing apartment community components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital additions activities at the apartment community level. We characterize as “indirect costs” an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital additions activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopments and developments are in progress. We commence capitalization of costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital addition activities, at the point in time when activities necessary to get apartment communities ready for their intended use begin. These activities include when apartment communities or apartment homes are undergoing physical construction, as well as when apartment homes are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting, planning and design are in progress. We cease the capitalization of costs when the apartment communities or components thereof are substantially complete and ready for their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and apartment homes are available for occupancy. We charge costs including ordinary repairs, maintenance and resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred. Refer to the discussion of investing activities within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for a summary of costs capitalized during the periods presented.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Real estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an apartment community may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the apartment community. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the apartment community.
As part of our portfolio strategy, we seek to sell up to 10% of our portfolio annually and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in accretive uses such as capital enhancements, redevelopments, occasional developments, and selective acquisitions with projected Free Cash Flow internal rates of return higher than expected from the communities being sold. As we execute this strategy, we evaluate alternatives to sell or reduce our interest in apartment communities that do not align with our long-term investment strategy, although there is no assurance that we will sell or reduce our investment in such apartment communities during the desired time frame. For any apartment communities that are sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale during the next 12 months, the reduction in the estimated holding period for these apartment communities may result in impairment losses.

Non-GAAP Measures
Various of the key financial indicators we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are non-GAAP measures. Key non-GAAP measures we use are defined and described below, and for those non-GAAP financial measures used or disclosed within this annual report, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP are provided.
Funds from Operations, Pro forma Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined and further described below under the Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations heading. Economic Income and Net Asset Value are non-GAAP financial measures defined and further described below under the Economic Income heading.

Table of Contents

Free Cash Flow, or FCF, as calculated for our retained portfolio, represents an apartment community’s property net operating income, or NOI, less spending for capital replacements, which represents our estimation of the capital additions made to replace capital assets consumed during our ownership period (further discussed under the Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations heading and the Liquidity and Capital Resources heading). FCF margin represents an apartment community’s NOI less $1,200 per apartment home of assumed annual capital replacement spending, as a percentage of the apartment community’s rental and other property revenues. Capital replacement spending is a method of measuring the cost of capital asset usage during the period; therefore we believe that FCF is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of apartment community performance because it takes into consideration costs incurred during the period to replace capital assets that have been consumed during our ownership.

Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations
Funds From Operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of, and impairment losses recognized with respect to, depreciable real estate, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis to determine FFO. We calculate FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted) by subtracting, if dilutive, redemption or repurchase related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock.
In addition to FFO, we compute Pro forma FFO and Adjusted FFO, or AFFO, which are also non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are helpful to investors in understanding our performance. Pro forma FFO represents FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted), excluding preferred equity redemption-related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Preferred equity redemption-related amounts (gains or losses) are items that periodically affect our operating results and we exclude these items from our calculation of Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of our operating performance.
Additionally in 2017, we recognized a net tax benefit associated with the December 2017 tax reform legislation consisting of a benefit related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities of Aimco’s taxable REIT subsidiaries, partially offset by a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. We excluded this net tax benefit from our computation of Pro forma FFO because this type of tax benefit occurs infrequently and is not representative of our operating performance.
AFFO represents Pro forma FFO reduced by Capital Replacements (also adjusted for noncontrolling interests), which represents our estimation of the capital additions made to replace capital assets consumed during our ownership period. When we make capital additions at an apartment community, we evaluate whether the additions extend the useful life of an asset as compared to its condition at the time we purchased the apartment community. We classify as Capital Improvements those capital additions that meet these criteria and we classify as Capital Replacements those that do not. AFFO is a key financial indicator we use to evaluate our operational performance and is one of the factors that we use to determine the amounts of our dividend payments.
FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss), as determined in accordance with GAAP, as indications of our performance. Although we use these non-GAAP measures for comparability in assessing our performance compared to other REITs, not all REITs compute these same measures and those who do may not compute them in the same manner. Additionally, computation of AFFO is subject to our definition of Capital Replacement spending. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other REITs.

(3) Represents the denominator for Aimco’s earnings per common share – diluted, calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Refer to the Executive Overview for discussion of our Pro forma FFO and AFFO results for 2017, as compared to their comparable periods in 2016.
Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further information regarding our capital investing activities, including Capital Replacements.
The Aimco Operating Partnership does not separately compute or report FFO, Pro forma FFO or AFFO. However, based on Aimco’s method for allocation of such amounts to noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership, as well as the limited differences between Aimco’s and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s net income amounts during the periods presented, FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO amounts on a per unit basis for the Aimco Operating Partnership would be expected to be substantially the same as the corresponding per share amounts for Aimco.

Economic Income
Economic Income represents stockholder value creation as measured by the change in estimated NAV per share plus cash dividends per share. We believe Economic Income is important to investors as it represents a measure of the total return we have earned for our stockholders. NAV, as used in our calculation of Economic Income, is a non-GAAP measure and represents the estimated fair value of assets net of liabilities attributable to Aimco’s common stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s common unitholders on a diluted basis. We believe NAV is considered useful by some investors in real estate companies because the value of company assets can be readily estimated, even for non-earning assets such as land or properties under development. NAV has the advantage of incorporating the investment decisions of thousands of real estate investors. We believe it enhances comparability among companies that have differences in their accounting. While NAV is not identical to liquidation value in that some costs and benefits are disregarded, it is often considered a floor with upside for value ascribed to the operating platform.

34

Table of Contents

NAV also provides an objective basis for the perceived quality and predictability of future cash flows as well as their expected growth as these are factors considered by real estate investors.
Our estimated NAV per share and the quoted share price of Aimco Common Stock are not necessarily equal. Although we use Economic Income and NAV for comparability in assessing our value creation compared to other REITs, not all REITs publish these measures and those who do may not compute them in the same manner. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these measures is comparable with that of other REITs.
We report NAV on a semiannual basis, as of the end of the first and third quarters. Economic Income for 2017, was calculated using the change in NAV per share between September 30, 2016 and 2017. NAV will fluctuate over time. This NAV information should not be relied upon as representative of the amount a stockholder could expect to receive in a liquidation event, now or in the future. Certain assets are excluded as are certain liabilities such as taxes and transaction costs associated with a liquidation. In addition, NAV is based on management’s subjective judgments, assumptions and opinions as of the date of determination. We assume no obligation to revise or update NAV to reflect subsequent or future events or circumstances. Our NAV estimate is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
A reconciliation of NAV to Aimco’s total equity, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, as of September 30, 2017, is provided below (in millions, except per share data):

(1) We compute NAV by estimating the value of our communities, using methods we believe are appropriate based on the characteristics of the communities. For purposes of estimating NAV, real estate at fair value disclosed above includes wholly owned apartment communities plus our proportionate share of communities held by non-wholly owned entities (both consolidated and unconsolidated), and excludes the estimated fair value of communities that are part of the Asset Management business. The value of Asset Management communities is factored into the valuation of the Asset Management portfolio as described in footnote 5. A reconciliation of our consolidated apartment communities to those communities included in total real estate at fair value in the table above is as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------- --- -

Consolidated apartment communities as of September 30, 2017 176
Less: Consolidated communities in the Asset Management portfolio (39 )
Plus: Unconsolidated apartment communities 4
Apartment communities in total real estate at fair value for NAV 141

For valuation purposes at September 30, 2017, we segregated these 141 communities into the following categories: stabilized portfolio and non-stabilized portfolio.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) As of September 30, 2017, our stabilized portfolio includes 123 communities that had reached stabilized operations and were not expected to be sold within twelve months. We value this portfolio using a direct capitalization rate method based on the annualized proportionate property NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2017, less a 2% management fee. Market property management fees range between 1.5% and 3.0% with larger, higher quality portfolios at the lower end of that range. The weighted average estimated capitalization rate as applied to the annualized property NOI was 5.1%, which we calculate on a property-by-property basis, based

35

Table of Contents

primarily on information published by a third-party. Community characteristics that we use to determine comparable market capitalization rates include: the market in which the community is located; infill or suburban location within the market; property quality grade; and whether the community is stabilized or value-add. We used this valuation method for approximately 79% of real estate fair value at September 30, 2017.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) The non-stabilized portfolio includes seven apartment communities under redevelopment at September 30, 2017 and two apartment communities in lease-up. We valued these communities by discounting projected future cash flows. Key assumptions used to estimate the value of these communities include: revenues, which are based on in-place rents, projected submarket rent growth to community stabilization based on projections published by third parties and adjusted for the impacts of redevelopment; expenses, which are based on estimated operating costs adjusted for inflation and a management fee equal to 2% of projected revenue; estimated remaining costs to complete construction; and a terminal value based on current market capitalization rates plus five basis points per year from September 30, 2017 to community stabilization. Discount rates applied to estimated future cash flows of these communities ranged between 6.00% and 7.15% depending on construction and lease-up progress. We used this valuation method for approximately 17% of the real estate fair value at September 30, 2017. The non-stabilized portfolio also included nine apartment communities under contract for sale, which were valued at sales contract price and represent approximately 4% of real estate fair value at September 30, 2017.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) We calculate the fair value of indebtedness related to real estate as the carrying value of our non-recourse property debt adjusted for the mark-to-market liability on our fixed-rate property debt as of September 30, 2017, plus the outstanding balances on the revolving line of credit and term loan, which approximate their fair value as of September 30, 2017. The mark-to-market has been computed using a money-weighted average interest rate of 4.15%, which rate takes into account the timing of amortization and maturities, and a market rate of 3.75%, which rate takes into account the duration of the existing property debt, the loan-to-value and debt service coverage, as well as timing of amortization and maturities. For purposes of estimating NAV, the fair value of debt includes our proportionate share of debt related to non-wholly owned entities (both consolidated and unconsolidated), and excludes non-recourse property debt obligations of consolidated partnerships of the Asset Management business, which is factored into the valuation of the Asset Management business as described in footnote 5.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) We estimate our share of the fair value of the Asset Management business as the present value of the expected future cash flows of various low-income housing tax credit partnerships using a 7% discount rate. As further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, the future cash flows we expect to receive include fees and other amounts to be paid from cash flows from the operation of the underlying communities and proceeds from sale of the underlying communities after repayment of any associated property-level debt. The key assumptions used to estimate the future cash flows we expect to receive include: operating cash flow, which is based on an estimate of contractual rents and expenses reflecting expected increases; the value of the underlying apartment communities, which we value using a direct capitalization rate method similar to that described in footnote 2 above; and the estimated sale date of the apartment communities, which is generally upon or shortly after the expiration of the tax credit compliance periods.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) Other tangible assets consist of cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable and other assets for which we reasonably expect to receive cash through the normal course of operations or another future event. Other tangible liabilities consist of accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other tangible liabilities we reasonably expect to settle in cash through the normal course of operations or another future event. Other tangible assets and liabilities were generally valued at their carrying amounts and reduced by the noncontrolling interests’ portion of these amounts and exclude intangible assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our preferred stock is estimated as the closing share price on September 30, 2017, less accrued dividends. Such accrued dividends are assumed to be accounted for in the closing share price and these amounts are also included in other tangible liabilities.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) Total shares, units and dilutive share equivalents represents Common Stock, OP Units, participating unvested restricted shares and the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding as of September 30, 2017.

Leverage Ratios
As discussed under the Balance Sheet and Liquidity heading, as part of our leverage strategy, we target the ratio of Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA to be below 7.0x and we target the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends to be greater than 2.5x. We believe these ratios are important measures as they are commonly used by investors and analysts to assess the relative financial risk associated with balance sheets of companies within the same industry, and they are believed to be similar to measures used by rating agencies to assess entity credit quality.
We calculate our leverage ratios based on the most recent three month amounts, annualized.
Proportionate Debt, as used in our leverage ratios, is a non-GAAP measure and includes our share of the long-term, non-recourse property debt secured by apartment communities in the Real Estate portfolio, our term loan, and outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, reduced by our share of the cash and restricted cash of our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships owning communities in our Real Estate portfolio, and also by our investment in the subordinate tranches of a securitization trust that holds certain of our property debt (essentially, an investment in our own non-recourse property loans).
In our Proportionate Debt computation, we increase our recorded debt by unamortized debt issue costs because these amounts represent cash expended in earlier periods and do not reduce our contractual obligations, and we reduce our recorded debt obligations by the amounts of cash and restricted cash on-hand (such restricted cash amounts being primarily restricted under the terms of

36

Table of Contents

our property debt agreements) assuming these amounts would be used to reduce our outstanding leverage. We further reduce our recorded debt by the value of our investment in a securitization trust that holds certain of our property debt, as our payments of principal and interest associated with such property debt will ultimately repay our investments in the trust.
We exclude from our leverage the non-recourse property debt obligations of consolidated partnerships served by our Asset Management business. The non-recourse property debt obligations of these partnerships are not our obligations and have limited effect on the amount of fees and other payments we expect to receive.
We believe Proportionate Debt is useful to investors as it is a measure of our net exposure to debt obligations. Proportionate Debt, as used in our leverage ratios, is calculated as set forth in the table below.
Preferred Equity, as used in our leverage ratios, represents the redemption amounts for Aimco’s preferred stock and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s preferred OP Units. Preferred Equity, although perpetual in nature, is another component of our overall leverage.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it allows investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis, before the effects of taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on sales of and impairment losses related to real estate and various other items described below.
Adjusted EBITDA represents Aimco’s share of the consolidated amount of our net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items for the reasons set forth below:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjusted Interest Expense, defined below, to allow investors to compare a measure of our earnings before the effects of our indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• preferred dividends, to allow investors to compare a measure of our performance before the effects of our capital structure and indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• income taxes, to allow investors to measure our performance independent of income taxes, which may vary significantly from other companies within our industry due to leverage and tax planning strategies, among other factors;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on dispositions and impairment losses related to real estate, for similar reasons to those set forth in our discussion of FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO in the preceding section; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• other items, including gains on dispositions of non-depreciable assets, as these are items that periodically affect our operations but that are not necessarily representative of our ability to service our debt obligations.

While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance and is commonly used in leverage ratios, it does not represent net income as defined by GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income in evaluating our performance. Further, our definition and computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.

Adjusted Interest Expense, as calculated in our leverage ratios, is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is meaningful for investors and analysts as it presents our share of current recurring interest requirements associated with leverage. Our calculation of Adjusted Interest Expense is set forth in the table below. Adjusted Interest Expense represents our proportionate share of interest expense on non-recourse property debt encumbering apartment communities in the Real Estate portfolio and interest expense on our term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings. We exclude from our calculation of Adjusted Interest Expense:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• debt prepayment penalties, which are items that, from time to time, affect our operating results, but are not representative of our scheduled interest obligations;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the amortization of debt issue costs, as these amounts have been expended in previous periods and are not representative of our current or prospective debt service requirements; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the income we receive on our investment in the securitization trust that holds certain of our property debt, as this income is being generated indirectly from interest we pay with respect to property debt held by the trust.

Preferred Dividends represents the preferred dividends paid on Aimco’s preferred stock and the preferred distributions paid on the Aimco Operating Partnership’s preferred OP Units, exclusive of preferred equity redemption related amounts. We add Preferred Dividends to Adjusted Interest Expense for a more complete picture of the interest and dividend requirements of our leverage, inclusive of perpetual preferred equity.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations. Additional sources are proceeds from sales of apartment communities, proceeds from refinancings of existing property debt, borrowings under new property debt, borrowings under our Credit Agreement, as defined below, including our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from equity offerings.
Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding property debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest partners and acquisitions of apartment communities. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short-term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our short-term liquidity needs, we have additional means, such as short-term borrowing availability and proceeds from apartment community sales and refinancings. We may use our revolving credit facility for working capital and other short-term purposes, such as funding investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities, redevelopment spending and apartment community acquisitions, through long-term borrowings (primarily non-recourse), the issuance of equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of apartment communities and cash generated from operations.
As of December 31, 2017, our primary sources of liquidity were as follows:

- -------------------------------------------
• $60.5 million in cash and cash equivalents;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $34.8 million of restricted cash, which consists primarily of escrows related to resident security deposits and reserves and escrows held by lenders for capital additions, property taxes and insurance; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $521.3 million of available capacity to borrow under our revolving credit facility (which is more fully described below), after consideration of outstanding borrowings of $67.2 million and $11.5 million of letters of credit backed by the facility.

At December 31, 2017, we also held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $1.8 billion. Each of the amounts presented above exclude amounts attributable to partnerships served by our Asset Management business.
Leverage and Capital Resources
The availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels and many lenders are active in the market. However, any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our

39

Table of Contents

liquidity. We believe we have mitigated much of this exposure by reducing our short and intermediate term maturity risk through refinancing such loans with long-dated, fixed-rate property debt. However, if property financing options become unavailable for our further debt needs, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in capital spending or proceeds from apartment community dispositions.
Two credit rating agencies rate our creditworthiness and both have rated our credit and outlook as BBB- (stable), an investment grade rating. Our investment grade rating would be useful in accessing capital through the sale of bonds in private or public transactions. However, our intention and historical practice has been to raise debt capital in the form of property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing debt, the cost of which is generally less than that of recourse debt and the terms of which also provide for greater balance sheet safety.
At December 31, 2017, approximately 86.7% of our leverage consisted of property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, amortizing debt. Approximately 97.7% of our property-level debt is fixed-rate, which provides a hedge against increases in interest rates, capitalization rates and inflation. The weighted average maturity of our property-level debt was 7.2 years.
For property debt encumbering the communities in our Real Estate portfolio, $173.7 million of our unpaid principal balances mature during 2018, of which $111.5 million was refinanced in January 2018 with ten-year, fixed-rate, non-recourse property debt. On average, 13.6% of our unpaid principal balances will mature each year from 2019 through 2021.
While our primary source of leverage is property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing debt, we have a Senior Secured Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions, which we refer to as our Credit Agreement. Our Credit Agreement provides for $600.0 million of revolving loan commitments. As of December 31, 2017, we had $67.2 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving loan commitments, representing 1.6% of our total leverage. The Credit Agreement provides us with an option to expand the aggregate loan commitments, subject to customary conditions, by up to $200.0 million.
During 2017, we amended the Credit Agreement to add a $250.0 million term loan to fund partially our reacquisition of limited partner interests in the Palazzo joint venture. The term loan represents 6.1% of our total leverage as of December 31, 2017, matures on June 30, 2018, has a one-year extension option and bears interest at 30-day LIBOR plus 135 basis points.
As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding perpetual preferred equity represented approximately 5.5% of our total leverage. Our preferred securities are perpetual in nature; however, for illustrative purposes, we compute the weighted average maturity of our total leverage assuming a 40-year maturity on our preferred securities.
The combination of non-recourse property level debt, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and perpetual preferred equity that comprises our total leverage, reduces our refunding and re-pricing risk. The weighted average maturity for our total leverage described above was 8.5 years as of December 31, 2017.
Under the Credit Agreement, we have agreed to maintain Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.40x, as well as other covenants customary for similar revolving credit arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Fixed Charge Coverage ratio was 2.01x, compared to ratio of 1.96x for the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect to remain in compliance with this covenant during the next 12 months.
Changes in Cash and Cash Equivalents
 The following discussion relates to changes in consolidated cash and cash equivalents due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8 of this report.
Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash provided by operating activities was $394.1 million. Our operating cash flow is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment communities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $16.4 million compared to 2016, due to improved operating results of our Same Store communities and increased contribution from redevelopment and lease-up communities, partially offset by a decrease in the net operating income associated with apartment communities we sold during 2016.

40

Table of Contents

Investing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by investing activities of $14.7 million consisted primarily of $402.2 million in proceeds from the sale of apartment communities, partially offset by capital expenditures.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we sold and acquired various apartment communities as further discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
Capital additions for our Real Estate segment totaled $338.0 million, $321.0 million and $340.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We generally fund capital additions with cash provided by operating activities and cash proceeds from sales of apartment communities.
We categorize capital spending for communities in our Real Estate portfolio broadly into six primary categories:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• capital replacements, which represent capital additions made to replace the portion of acquired apartment communities consumed during our period of ownership;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• capital improvements, which represent capital additions made to replace the portion of acquired apartment communities consumed prior to our period of ownership;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• capital enhancements, which may include kitchen and bath remodeling, energy conservation projects and investments in longer-lived materials designed to reduce turnover and maintenance costs, all of which are generally lesser in scope than redevelopment additions and do not significantly disrupt property operations;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• redevelopment additions, which represent capital additions intended to enhance the value of the apartment community through the ability to generate higher average rental rates, and may include costs related to entitlement, which enhance the value of a community through increased density, and costs related to renovation of exteriors, common areas or apartment homes;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• development additions, which represent construction and related capitalized costs associated with development of apartment communities; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• casualty capital additions, which represent construction and related capitalized costs incurred in connection with the restoration of an apartment community after a casualty event such as a severe snow storm, hurricane, tornado, flood or fire.

We exclude from these measures the amounts of capital spending related to apartment communities sold or classified as held for sale at the end of the period, as well as amounts expended by consolidated partnerships served by our Asset Management business as such amounts generally do not affect the amount of cash flow we expect to receive from the operation and ultimate disposition of these communities.
A summary of the capital spending for these categories, along with a reconciliation of the total for these categories to the capital expenditures reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, are presented below (dollars in thousands):

Net investment represents the total actual or estimated investment, net of tax and other credits earned as a direct result of our redevelopment or development of the community.
NOI Stabilization represents the period in which we expect the communities to achieve stabilized rents and operating costs, generally five quarters after occupancy stabilization.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we invested $172.4 million primarily in our ongoing redevelopment and development projects.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed construction on the third tower of Park Towne Place in Center City, Philadelphia. As of December 31, 2017, the first three towers combined were 89% leased with approximately 40 homes remaining to be leased at the third redeveloped tower to reach occupancy stabilization. Based on these results, we decided to proceed with a $40 million redevelopment of the fourth and final tower. We have completed de-leasing and commenced construction on this tower, and lease-up is scheduled to commence in the spring of 2018.
Also in Center City Philadelphia, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed redevelopment and the lease-up of the 534 apartment homes at The Sterling and substantially completed the reconfiguration of the second floor commercial space, upgrades to the third and fourth floor commercial space and upgrades to residential common areas.

We have planned and entitled a new $117.0 million, 226 apartment home community to be known as Parc Mosaic, located in Boulder, Colorado on the site of our Eastpointe community. As part of this plan, as of December 31, 2017, we completed the de-leasing of Eastpointe and commenced demolition and construction. The site is two miles from the new Google campus and is across the street from Ball Aerospace’s Technology Campus and Foothills Hospital. Building in Boulder is highly regulated and new supply is limited, notwithstanding higher enrollment at the University of Colorado and increased employment generally.
Inclusive of the redevelopment and development projects discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2017 we expanded our redevelopment and development pipeline by $228.9 million. The total estimated net investment for these redevelopment and development communities is $714.6 million, with a projected weighted average net operating income yield on these investments of 6.1% assuming untrended rents. As of December 31, 2017, $513.1 million of this total has been funded.
We expect our total redevelopment and development spending to range from $120 million to $200 million for the year ending December 31, 2018.
Financing Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash used in financing activities of $393.3 million was primarily attributed to our reacquisition of the limited partner interests in the Palazzo communities, dividends paid to common security holders, distributions paid to noncontrolling interests and principal payments on property loans, partially offset by proceeds from the term loan, net borrowings on our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from non-recourse property debt.
Net borrowings on our revolving credit facility primarily relate to the timing of property debt financing activities and apartment community dispositions. Proceeds from non-recourse property debt borrowings during the year consisted of the closing of seven fixed-rate, non-recourse, amortizing, property loans totaling $308.8 million. On a weighted basis, the term of these loans averaged 8.2 years and their interest rates averaged 3.48%, 121 basis points more than the corresponding 10-year Treasury rate at the time of pricing.
We like the discipline of financing our investments in real estate through the use of fixed-rate, amortizing, non-recourse property debt, as the amortization gradually reduces our leverage and reduces our refunding risk, the fixed-rate provides a hedge against increases in interest rates, and the non-recourse feature avoids entity risk.
Principal payments on property loans during the year totaled $409.2 million, consisting of $85.1 million of scheduled principal amortization and repayments of $324.1 million.
Net cash used in financing activities also includes $260.8 million of payments to equity holders, as further detailed in the table below.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Includes interest related to both fixed-rate and variable-rate non-recourse property debt, our variable-rate revolving credit facility borrowings, and our variable-rate term loan. Interest related to variable-rate debt is estimated based on the rate effective at December 31, 2017. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a description of average interest rates associated with our debt.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, at December 31, 2017, we had $125.0 million (liquidation value) of Aimco’s perpetual preferred stock outstanding with an annual dividend yield of 6.9% and $101.5 million (liquidation value) of redeemable preferred OP Units of the Aimco Operating Partnership outstanding with annual distribution yields ranging from 1.92% to 8.8%. The dividends and distributions that accrue on the perpetual preferred stock and redeemable preferred OP Units are cumulative and are paid quarterly.
At December 31, 2017, communities owned by partnerships served by our Asset Management business were encumbered by $231.4 million of non-recourse property debt, $43.3 million of which matures in the next five years. The partnerships’ future obligation for interest related to this debt is $124.6 million, $52.3 million of which will be incurred over the next five years. The non-recourse property debt obligations of these partnerships have limited effect on the amount of fees and other payments we expect to receive.
Additionally, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our apartment communities. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.
Future Capital Needs
In addition to the items set forth in “Contractual Obligations” above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, redevelopment, development and other capital spending principally with proceeds from apartment community sales, short-term borrowings, debt and equity financing and operating cash flows. Our near-term business plan does not contemplate the issuance of equity.

As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,397 million shares and 509 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification). As a result, we will not proceed with the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. 77 Share Repurchase Program In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 b...

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...
