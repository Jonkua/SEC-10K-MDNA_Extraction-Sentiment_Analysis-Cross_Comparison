Revenues for 2018 and 2017 increased 5% and 4% compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to market growth, reflecting growing drug utilization and price increases, our business acquisitions and expanded business with existing customers within our North America pharmaceutical distribution businesses. These increases for 2018 and 2017 were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion and loss of customers and for 2018 also by the contribution of the majority of our McKesson Technology Solutions businesses (“Core MTS Business”) to a joint venture in March 2017, as further discussed below.

McKESSON CORPORATION
FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2018 and 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The decrease for 2018 was primarily due to the contribution of the Core MTS Business, significant government reimbursement reductions in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), the competitive sell-side environment and weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends. These decreases in 2018 were partially offset by market growth, procurement benefits realized through the joint sourcing entity, ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP (“ClarusONE”), higher last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) credits and our business acquisitions.
Gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2017 primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, the competitive sell-side pricing environment, our mix of business and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. These decreases for 2017 were partially offset by our business acquisitions, LIFO inventory credits, higher cash receipts from antitrust legal settlements and higher procurement benefits. Gross profit for 2017 and 2016 benefited from $144 million and $76 million of cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements. LIFO credits were $99 million and $7 million in 2018 and 2017 and LIFO charges were $244 million in 2016. LIFO credits were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher net effect of price declines, partially offset by the lower inventory level. LIFO expense was recognized in 2016 primarily due to net effects of price increases.
 Our Distribution Solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends over the last three years.
On March 1, 2017, we contributed our Core MTS Business to the newly formed joint venture, Change Healthcare, LLC (“Change Healthcare”) under the terms of a contribution agreement entered into between McKesson and Change Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (“Change”) and others including shareholders of Change. We retained our RelayHealth Pharmacy (“RHP”) and Enterprise Information Solutions (“EIS”) businesses. The RHP business was transferred to our MDS segment, effective April 1, 2017, and the EIS business was sold to a third party in the third quarter of 2018. We accounted for this transaction as a sale of the Core MTS Business and a subsequent purchase of a 70% interest in the newly formed joint venture. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information.
Total operating expenses increased in 2018 and decreased in 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million (after-tax gain of $3,018 million) recognized in 2017 from the contribution of the Core MTS Business.
2018 total operating expenses also increased due to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total non-cash goodwill impairment charges (pre-tax and after-tax) of $1,738 million for our McKesson Europe AG (“McKesson Europe”) and Rexall Health reporting units, as further described below. The charges were recorded within our Distribution Solutions segment. There were no tax benefits associated with these goodwill impairment charges.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Non-cash pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges of $446 million ($410 million after-tax) and pre-tax restructuring charges of $74 million ($67 million after-tax) primarily representing employee severance and lease exit costs for our McKesson Europe business;

- -----------------------------------------------------
• Higher expenses due to our business acquisitions; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Pre-tax charitable contribution expense of $100 million ($64 million after-tax) to a public benefit California foundation (“Foundation”), as further described below.

These increases in 2018 total operating expenses were partially offset by a pre-tax gain of $109 million (after-tax gain of $30 million) from the 2018 third quarter sale of our EIS business in our Technology Solutions segment.
Excluding the gain on Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, 2017 total operating expenses increased primarily due to a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million ($282 million after-tax) related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment and higher expenses due to our business acquisitions. 2017 total operating expenses benefited from lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with a cost alignment plan implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and ongoing expense management efforts.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Our investment in Change Healthcare is accounted for using the equity method of accounting. During 2018, we recorded our proportionate share of loss from Change Healthcare of $248 million under the caption, “Loss from Equity Method Investment in Change Healthcare,” in our consolidated statements of operations. We recorded our proportionate share of a provisional net benefit recognized by Change Healthcare from the enactment of the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) of $76 million primarily due to a reduction in future applicable tax rate.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $122 million ($78 million after-tax) on debt extinguishment related to our February 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing outstanding long-term debt. Refer to Financial Note 16, “Debt and Financing Activities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information.
Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased in 2018 and increased in 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago primarily due to the pre-tax gain recognized in 2017 from the contribution of the Core MTS Business. Income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased in 2018 also due to the goodwill impairment charges within our Distribution Solutions segment, the restructuring and asset impairment charges, our proportionate share of loss from our equity method investment in Change Healthcare and loss on debt extinguishment.
Our reported income tax benefit rate was 22.2% in 2018 and income tax expense rates were 23.4% and 27.9% in 2017 and 2016. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to change in tax laws, including the recently enacted 2017 Tax Act, the impact of nondeductible impairment charges and varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have income tax rates different from the U.S. rate.
During 2018, as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we have recognized a provisional tax benefit of $1,324 million due to the re-measurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower U.S. federal tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $457 million for the one-time tax imposed on certain accumulated earnings and profits (“E&P”) of our foreign subsidiaries. Refer to Financial Note 10, “Income Taxes,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information.
Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for 2017 includes an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $113 million resulting from the 2017 first quarter sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business.
Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $67 million, $5,070 million and $2,258 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and diluted earnings per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from continuing operations were $0.30, $23.28 and $9.84. Diluted income (loss) per common share attributable to McKesson Corporation from discontinued operations were $0.02, ($0.55) and ($0.14) in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Additionally, our 2018 diluted earnings per share reflect the cumulative effects of share repurchases.
Foundation
During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Foundation was established to provide opioid education to patients, caregivers, and providers, address policy issues, and increase patient access to life-saving treatments. In March 2018, we made a pledge to the Foundation and incurred a pre-tax charitable contribution expense of $100 million ($64 million after-tax) for 2018, which was recorded in operating expenses within Corporate Expenses. The pledge is binding and enforceable and is expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2019.
Goodwill Impairments
McKesson Europe: In 2018, we recorded total non-cash pre-tax and after-tax charges of $1,283 million to impair the carrying value of goodwill for our McKesson Europe reporting unit.

McKESSON CORPORATION
FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

During the second quarter of 2018, our McKesson Europe reporting unit had a decline in its estimated future cash flows, primarily in our United Kingdom (“U.K.”) retail business, driven by significant government reimbursement reductions affecting retail pharmacy economics across the U.K. market. As a result, we performed the interim impairment test in the second quarter of 2018 and recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $350 million (pre-tax and after-tax).  During the fourth quarter of 2018, this reporting unit had a further decline in its estimated future cash flows driven by weakening script growth projections in our U.K. business and by a more competitive environment in France. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, we recorded non-cash charges of $933 million (pre-tax and after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2018 to impair this reporting unit’s goodwill balance. The discount rates and terminal growth rates were 7.5% and 1.25% for the 2018 second quarter interim test and 8.0% and 1.25% for the 2018 annual test, compared to 7.0% and 1.5% in our 2017 annual impairment test. At March 31, 2018, this reporting unit had a remaining goodwill balance of $1,851 million.
Rexall Health: As a result of the 2018 annual impairment test, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge (pre-tax and after-tax) of $455 million in 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2018, this reporting unit had a decline in its estimated future cash flows primarily driven by significant generics reimbursement reductions across Canada and minimum wage increases in multiple provinces which can only be partially mitigated through the business’ cost saving efforts. The discount rate and terminal growth rate used in the annual impairment testing were 10.0% and 2.0%. At March 31, 2018, the Rexall Health reporting unit had no remaining goodwill related to our acquisition of Rexall Health.

Other risks, expenses and future developments that we were unable to anticipate as of the testing dates in 2018 may require us to further revise the estimated future cash flows, which could adversely affect the fair value of our reporting units in future periods. As a result, we may be required to record additional impairment charges. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Goodwill Impairment Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Restructuring and Asset Impairments

McKesson Europe: Due to the previously described decline in future estimated cash flows related to our U.K. retail business, we also recorded total non-cash pre-tax charges of $189 million ($157 million after-tax) to impair the carrying value of certain intangible assets (primarily pharmacy licenses) and store assets during the second quarter of 2018. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2018, due to further declines in estimated future cash flows in our European business, we also recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $257 million ($253 million after-tax) to impair the carrying value of certain intangible assets (primarily customer relationships) and capitalized software assets.

On September 29, 2017, we committed to a restructuring plan, which primarily consists of the closures or sales of underperforming retail stores in the U.K. and a reduction in workforce. The plan is expected to be substantially implemented prior to the first half of 2019. As part of this plan, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $74 million ($67 million after-tax) in operating expenses during 2018 primarily representing employee severance and lease exit costs.

Refer to Financial Note 4, “Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.

Revenues increased 5% and 4% in 2018 and 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago primarily driven by our Distribution Solutions segment.
Distribution Solutions
North America pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth, reflecting growing drug utilization, price increases, higher revenues associated with our acquisitions and expanded business with existing customers. These increases were partially offset by price deflation associated with brand to generic drug conversion and loss of customers.
 International pharmaceutical distribution and services revenues increased 10% and 6% in 2018 and 2017. Excluding foreign currency effects, revenues increased 5% in 2018 and 11% in 2017 primarily due to our business acquisitions and market growth.
Medical-Surgical distribution and services revenues increased over the last two years primarily due to market growth.
Technology Solutions
Technology Solutions revenues for 2018 and 2017 decreased primarily due to the 2017 fourth quarter contribution of the Core MTS Business to form the Change Healthcare joint venture, the April 2017 transition of our RHP business to our Distribution Solutions segment and the 2018 third quarter sale of our EIS business. As a result, this segment’s 2018 revenues included only our EIS business.

(1) Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit includes LIFO credits of $99 million and $7 million in 2018 and 2017 and LIFO charges of $244 million in 2016. Gross profit for 2017 and 2016 also includes $144 million and $76 million of net cash proceeds representing our share of antitrust legal settlements.

Gross profit and gross profit margin decreased in 2018 and 2017 compared to the same periods a year ago. The decreases in 2018 were primarily due the previously described contribution of our Core MTS Business to Change Healthcare.
Distribution Solutions
Distribution Solutions segment’s gross profit increased 12% in 2018 and decreased 1% in 2017. As a percentage of revenues, gross profit increased by 29 bp in 2018 and decreased by 26 bp in 2017.
Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2018 increased compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to market growth, procurement benefits realized through ClarusONE, higher LIFO inventory credits, our business acquisitions and the transfer of our RHP business from our Technology Solutions segment. These increases were partially offset by significant government reimbursement reductions in the U.K., the competitive sell-side pricing environment, weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends and our mix of business. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2017 decreased primarily due to weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, the competitive sell-side pricing environment and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer in our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business, partially offset by LIFO inventory credits, higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements, higher procurement benefits and our business acquisitions. Gross profit also reflects the impact of recent customer consolidation activities.
Our Distribution Solutions segment experienced weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends over the last three years.
Our LIFO inventory credits were $99 million and $7 million in 2018 and 2017 and LIFO charges were $244 million in 2016. Our North America distribution business uses the LIFO method of accounting for the majority of its inventories, which results in cost of sales that more closely reflects replacement cost than under other accounting methods. The business’ practice is to pass on to customers published price changes from suppliers. Manufacturers generally provide us with price protection, which limits price-related inventory losses. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the net impact of price declines, including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the net impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory. Our annual LIFO charge or credit is affected by changes in year-end inventory quantities, product mix and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be influenced by market and other external factors. Changes to any of the above factors could have a material impact to our annual LIFO credit or expense. LIFO credits were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher net effect of price declines, partially offset by lower inventory level. LIFO expense was recognized in 2016 primarily due to net effects of price increases. As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, pharmaceutical inventories at LIFO did not exceed current replacement cost.

McKESSON CORPORATION
FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Technology Solutions
Technology Solutions segment’s gross profit decreased in 2018 and 2017. Gross profit and gross profit margin for 2018 decreased primarily due to the 2017 fourth quarter contribution of the Core MTS Business, the transfer of our RHP business to our Distribution Solutions segment and the 2018 third quarter sale of our EIS business. As a result, this segment’s 2018 gross profit and gross profit margin included only our EIS business.
Gross profit for 2017 decreased due to one less month of gross profit from the Core MTS Business, which was contributed to the joint venture on March 1, 2017. Gross profit margin for 2017 increased primarily due to a decline in hospital software revenues, lower severance charges, ongoing cost management efforts and the prior year sales of businesses, partially offset by a lower margin from our hospital software business. Gross profit margin for 2017 also benefited from lower depreciation and amortization expenses related to the Core MTS Business’ assets, which were classified as held for sale since the second quarter of 2017. Depreciation and amortization related to the long-lived assets ceased as of the date they were determined as held for sale.

Table of Contents
McKESSON CORPORATION
FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Total operating expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Non-cash goodwill impairment charges (pre-tax and after-tax) of $1,283 million for our McKesson Europe reporting unit and $455 million for our Rexall Health reporting unit;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Non-cash pre-tax long-lived asset impairment charges of $446 million ($410 million after-tax) and pre-tax restructuring charges of $74 million ($67 million after-tax) for our McKesson Europe business;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Non-cash charges of $33 million (pre-tax and after-tax) to impair the carrying value of certain intangible assets (primarily customer relationships) for our Rexall Health business. The impairment was primarily due to the decline in the estimated future cash flows from certain pharmacies of Rexall Health’s business, driven primarily by generics reimbursement reductions implemented across Canada; and

- -------------------------------------------------
• Higher expenses due to our business acquisitions.

We expect to record total pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $90 million to $130 million for our McKesson Europe business, of which $74 million of pre-tax charges were recorded through the end of 2018.  Estimated remaining restructuring charges primarily consist of lease termination and other exit costs.
Total operating expenses increased in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to our acquisitions and higher acquisition-related expenses and intangible amortization, partially offset by lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with the 2016 Cost Alignment Plan, ongoing expense management efforts and lower bad debt expense. Total operating expenses for 2016 include a pre-tax gain from the 2016 sale of a business.
Technology Solutions
Technology Solutions segment had operating credits of $104 million and $2,799 million in 2018 and 2017 primarily due to gains that offset operating expenses.

Total operating expenses for 2018 benefited from a pre-tax gain of $109 million (after-tax gain of $30 million) from the 2018 third quarter sale of our EIS business, a pre-tax credit of $46 million ($30 million after-tax) from the re-measurement of the liability related to a tax receivable agreement with Change Healthcare shareholders and a pre-tax gain of $37 million (after-tax gain of $22 million) representing the final net working capital and other adjustments from the 2017 Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.

On August 1, 2017, we entered into an agreement with a third party to sell our EIS business for $185 million, subject to adjustments for net debt and working capital. On October 2, 2017, the transaction closed upon satisfaction of all closing conditions including the termination of the waiting period under U.S. antitrust laws. We received net cash proceeds of $169 million after $16 million of assumed net debt by the third party. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $109 million (after-tax gain of $30 million) upon the disposition of this business in the third quarter of 2018 within operating expenses in our Technology Solutions segment.

Total operating expenses for 2017 benefited from the pre-tax gain of $3,947 million (after-tax gain of $3,018 million) from the contribution of Core MTS Business, partially offset by a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $290 million ($282 million after-tax) for the EIS reporting unit, cost savings from the 2016 Cost Alignment Plan and ongoing cost management efforts and one less month of expenses from the Core MTS Business. Total operating expenses for 2016 include a pre-tax gain from the 2016 sale of a business.

Corporate
Corporate expenses increased 43% in 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to a charitable contribution expense of $100 million ($64 million after-tax) to the Foundation and higher professional fees incurred for Corporate initiatives.
Corporate expenses decreased 17% in 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with the 2016 Cost Alignment Plan, including lower compensation and benefit costs and outside service fees. Corporate expenses for 2017 also benefited from a pre-tax gain of $15 million from the sale-leaseback transaction of our corporate headquarters building.

Other Income, Net: Other income, net for 2018 increased primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $43 million ($26 million after-tax) recognized from the sale of an equity method investment within our Distribution Solutions segment, partially offset by lower rental income for Corporate. Other income, net for 2017 increased primarily due to higher equity investment income within our Distribution Solutions segment.
Loss from Equity Method Investment in Change Healthcare: 2018 included our proportionate share of loss from Change Healthcare of $248 million, which primarily consisted of transaction and integration expenses incurred by the joint venture and fair value adjustments including amortization expenses associated with equity method intangible assets, partially offset by a tax benefit of $76 million primarily due to a reduction in the future applicable tax rate related to the 2017 Tax Act.
Acquisition-Related Expenses and Adjustments
Acquisition-related expenses, which included transaction and integration expenses directly related to business acquisitions and the gain on the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange were $168 million, $(3,797) million and $114 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. 2018 includes $37 million gain associated with the final net working capital and other adjustments from the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange and our proportionate share of transaction and integration expenses incurred by Change Healthcare. 2017 includes a pre-tax gain of $3,947 million from the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. Expenses in 2018 were higher primarily due to our proportionate share of transaction and integration expenses incurred by Change Healthcare. Expenses in 2017 were higher primarily due to our business acquisitions of UDG, Vantage, Biologics and Rexall Health, partially offset by a decline in expenses associated with our February 2014 acquisition of McKesson Europe and February 2013 acquisition of PSS World Medical, Inc. (“PSSI”). Our integration of PSSI and McKesson Europe were substantially completed in 2017.

Amortization Expenses of Acquired Intangible Assets
Amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets directly related to business acquisitions and the formation of the Change Healthcare joint venture were $792 million, $440 million and $423 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. These expenses were primarily recorded in our operating expenses and in our proportionate share of loss from the equity method investment in Change Healthcare. Amortization expenses increased in 2018 primarily due to amortization expenses of equity method intangibles associated with the Change Healthcare joint venture and our acquisition of CMM. Amortization expenses increased in 2017 primarily due to our acquisitions of UDG, Biologics, Vantage and Rexall Health, partially offset by lower amortization expense related to Core MTS Business assets which were classified as held for sale since the 2017 second quarter.

Segment Operating Profit (Loss)
Distribution Solutions: Operating profit and operating profit margin decreased for 2018 compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charges and restructuring and long-lived asset impairment charges related to our McKesson Europe and Rexall Health businesses. These decreases were partially offset by the improved gross profit margin primarily due to market growth within our North America distribution businesses, procurement benefits, our business acquisitions and higher LIFO credits. 2018 operating profit and operating profit margin were also unfavorably affected by government reimbursement reductions in the U.K. and the competitive sell-side pricing environment.
Operating profit margin decreased for 2017 primarily due to a decline in gross profit margin reflecting weaker pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing trends, the competitive sell-side pricing environment and lower compensation from a branded pharmaceutical manufacturer from our U.S. Pharmaceutical distribution business. Operating profit and operating profit margin in 2017 benefited from LIFO credits, our acquisitions, lower restructuring charges and cost savings associated with the 2016 Cost Alignment Plan and higher cash receipts representing our share of antitrust legal settlements.

Technology Solutions: Operating profit decreased for 2018 primarily due to the 2017 contribution of our Core MTS Business and loss from the equity method investment in Change Healthcare. The decrease is partially offset by a gain from the sale of our EIS business. Operating profit and operating profit margin increased in 2017 primarily due to the gain from the 2017 contribution of the Core MTS Business, which was partially offset by the non-cash EIS goodwill impairment pre-tax charge of $290 million. 2017 operating profit benefited from lower restructuring charges and cost savings from the 2016 Cost Alignment Plan. Operating profit for 2017 was unfavorably affected by one less month of operating profit from the Core MTS business, which was contributed to Change Healthcare on March 1, 2017.
Corporate: Corporate expenses, net, increased for 2018 primarily due to higher operating expenses driven by a charitable contribution expense of $100 million, Corporate initiatives and lower other income compared to the same period a year ago. Corporate expenses, net, decreased in 2017 primarily due to lower restructuring charges and a pre-tax gain from a sale-leaseback transaction.
Loss on Debt Extinguishment: We recognized a pre-tax loss on debt extinguishment of $122 million ($78 million after-tax) primarily representing premiums related to our February 2018 tender offers to redeem a portion of our existing outstanding long-term debt.
Interest Expense: Interest expense over the last two years decreased primarily due to the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase relating to the issuance of commercial paper. Interest expense fluctuates based on timing, amounts and interest rates of term debt repaid and new term debt issued, as well as amounts incurred associated with financing fees.

Income Taxes
During 2018, 2017 and 2016, our income tax benefit was $53 million and income tax expenses were $1,614 million and $908 million related to continuing operations. Our reported income tax benefit rate was 22.2% in 2018 and income tax expense rates were 23.4% and 27.9% in 2017 and 2016. Fluctuations in our reported income tax rates are primarily due to change in tax laws, including the recently enacted 2017 Tax Act, the impact of nondeductible impairment charges and varying proportions of income attributable to foreign countries that have income tax rates different from the U.S. rate.
Our reported income tax benefit rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by the 2017 Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we recognized a provisional tax benefit of $1,324 million due to the re-measurement of certain deferred taxes to the lower U.S. federal tax rate and a provisional tax expense of $457 million for the one-time tax imposed on certain accumulated E&P of our foreign subsidiaries.
Our reported income tax benefit rate for 2018 was unfavorably impacted by non-cash pre-tax charges totaling $1,738 million to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our McKesson Europe and Rexall Health reporting units within our Distribution Solutions segment, given that no tax benefit was recognized for these charges. Our reported income tax expense rate for 2017 was unfavorably affected by a non-cash pre-tax charge of $290 million to impair the carrying value of goodwill related to our EIS business within our Technology Solutions segment given that the majority of this charge was not deductible for income tax purposes. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Goodwill Impairment Charges,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information.
On December 19, 2016, we sold various software relating to our Technology Solutions business between wholly owned legal entities within the McKesson group that are based in different tax jurisdictions. The transferor entity recognized a gain on the sale of assets that was not subject to income tax in its local jurisdiction; such gain was eliminated upon consolidation. An entity based in the U.S. was the recipient of the software and is entitled to amortize the fair value of the assets for book and tax purposes. For U.S. GAAP purposes, the tax benefit associated with the amortization of these assets is recognized over the tax lives of the assets. As a result, a net tax benefit of $137 million was recognized prior to the contribution of a portion of these assets to Change Healthcare as described in Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange”. In 2018, a net tax benefit of $178 million was recognized associated with the amortization of the software.
In October 2016, amended guidance was issued to require entities to recognize income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amended guidance is effective for us commencing in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates recording approximately $130 million to $160 million of deferred tax assets with a corresponding cumulative-effect increase to retained earnings in the beginning of the period of adoption on its consolidated financial statements for the tax consequences relating to the intra-entity transfer of software.
On March 1, 2017, we contributed assets to Change Healthcare as further described in Financial Note 2, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange”. While this transaction was predominantly structured as a tax free asset contribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 721(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, we recorded tax expense of $929 million on the gain. The tax expense was primarily driven by the recognition of a deferred tax liability on the excess book over tax basis in our equity investment in Change Healthcare.
Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and evaluating income tax uncertainties. Although our major taxing jurisdictions include the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom, we are subject to income taxes in numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties.
We signed the Revenue Agent’s Report from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) relating to their audit of the fiscal years 2010 through 2012 on December 29, 2017. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state and local jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to audit by the IRS for fiscal years 2013 through the current fiscal year. We are generally subject to audit by taxing authorities in various U.S. states and in foreign jurisdictions for fiscal years 2010 through the current fiscal year.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax
Income (Losses) from discontinued operations, net of tax, were $5 million, ($124 million) and ($32 million) in 2018, 2017 and 2016.
Loss from discontinued operations, net for 2017 includes an after-tax loss of $113 million related to the sale of our Brazilian pharmaceutical distribution business within our Distribution Solutions segment, which we acquired through our February 2014 acquisition of McKesson Europe. In 2015, we committed to a plan to sell this business and the results of operations and cash flows for this business had been classified as discontinued operations since 2015. On May 31, 2016, we completed the sale of this business and recognized the loss primarily for the settlement of certain indemnification matters as well as the release of the cumulative translation losses. We made a payment of approximately $100 million related to the sale in 2017.
Refer to Financial Note 7, “Discontinued Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for all periods presented includes the annual recurring compensation that we are obligated to pay to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe under the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (the “Domination Agreement”).  In 2018 and 2017, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes third-party equity interests in our consolidated entities including Vantage and ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP, which was established between McKesson and Walmart, Inc. in 2017. Noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put rights, that are not solely within the Company’s control are considered redeemable noncontrolling interests.  Redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of Stockholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Financial Note 11, “Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests and Noncontrolling Interests,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Net Income Attributable to McKesson Corporation: Net income attributable to McKesson Corporation was $67 million, $5,070 million and $2,258 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and diluted earnings per common share were $0.32, $22.73 and $9.70.
Weighted Average Diluted Common Shares Outstanding:  Diluted earnings per common share was calculated based on a weighted average number of shares outstanding of 209 million, 223 million and 233 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding is affected by the exercise and settlement of share-based awards and in 2018 and 2017, and the cumulative effect of share repurchases.

Foreign Operations
Our foreign operations represented approximately 18%, 17% and 17% of our consolidated revenues in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks, including currency fluctuations. We monitor our operations and adopt strategies responsive to changes in the economic and political environment in each of the countries in which we operate. We conduct our business worldwide in local currencies including Euro, British pound sterling and Canadian dollar. As a result, the comparability of our results reported in U.S. dollars can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  In discussing our operating results, we may use the term “foreign currency effect”, which refers to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to convert the local currency results of foreign countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We present this information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.  In computing foreign currency effect, we translate our current year results in local currencies into U.S dollars by applying average foreign exchange rates of the corresponding prior year periods, and we subsequently compare those results to the previously reported results of the comparable prior year periods in U.S. dollars. Additional information regarding our foreign operations is included in Financial Note 28, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Business Combinations
Recently Announced Business Acquisition
On April 25, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Medical Specialties Distributors LLC (“MSD”) for $800 million, which will be funded from cash on hand. MSD is a leading national distributor of infusion and medical-surgical supplies as well as provider of biomedical services to alternate site and home health providers. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close during the first half of 2019. Upon closing, the financial results of MSD will be included in our consolidated statements of operations within our Medical-Surgical Solutions business.
Other Business Acquisitions
Refer to Financial Note 6, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Fiscal 2019 Operating Segments
As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, the executive who was our segment manager of the Distribution Solutions segment retired from the Company in January 2018. As a result, the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluated our management and operating structure. In connection with the completion of this evaluation in the first quarter of 2019, our operating structure is realigned, and we will report our financial results in three reportable segments on a retrospective basis commencing in the first quarter of 2019, as follows:

- --------------------------------------------
• U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions;

- --------------------------------------
• European Pharmaceutical Solutions; and

- ---------------------------
• Medical-Surgical Solutions.

All remaining operating segments and business activities that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure will be included in Other. Other primarily consists of McKesson Canada, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions and our equity method investment in Change Healthcare. The segment changes will reflect how our CODM allocates resources and assesses performance commencing in the first quarter of 2019. The segment changes will not affect the previously issued consolidated financial statements nor earnings per common share of McKesson for historical periods.

Strategic Growth Initiative

On April 25, 2018, the Company announced a multi-year strategic growth initiative, focused on creating innovative new solutions that improve patient care delivery and drive incremental profit growth. The initiative includes a comprehensive review of the Company’s operations and cost structure, designed to increase efficiency, accelerate execution and improve long-term performance. As part of the preliminary phase of this initiative, in April 2018, we committed to a restructuring plan to optimize our operating model and cost structure which will be substantially implemented by the end of 2019. We expect to record total after-tax charges of approximately $150 million to $210 million during 2019. The charges under this plan primarily consist of employee severance, exit-related costs and other charges.

Fiscal 2019 Outlook
Information regarding the Company’s fiscal 2019 outlook is contained in our Form 8-K dated May 24, 2018. This Form 8-K should be read in conjunction with the sections Item 1 - Business - Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A - Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on our financial condition or results from operations. Below are the estimates that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition. Other accounting policies are described in Financial Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We provide short-term credit and other customer financing arrangements to customers who purchase our products and services. Other customer financing primarily relates to guarantees provided to our customers, or their creditors, regarding the repurchase of inventories. We also provide financing to certain customers related to the purchase of pharmacies, which serve as collateral for the loans. We estimate the receivables for which we do not expect full collection based on historical collection rates and specific knowledge regarding the current creditworthiness of our customers and record an allowance in our consolidated financial statements for these amounts.
In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes general and specific reserves, the Company reviews accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength, credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history to assess the probability of collection. If the frequency and severity of customer defaults due to our customers’ financial condition or general economic conditions change, our allowance for uncollectible accounts may require adjustment. As a result, we continuously monitor outstanding receivables and other customer financing and adjust allowances for accounts where collection may be in doubt. During 2018, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) accounted for approximately 51.7% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 19.9% of our total consolidated revenues. At March 31, 2018, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 24.9% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS were approximately 16.4% of total trade accounts receivable. As a result, our sales and credit concentration is significant. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivables balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. A material default in payment, a material reduction in purchases from these or any other large customers, or the loss of a large customer or GPO could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
Reserve methodologies are assessed annually based on historical losses and economic, business and market trends. In addition, reserves are reviewed quarterly and updated if unusual circumstances or trends are present. We believe the reserves maintained and expenses recorded in 2018 are appropriate and consistent with historical methodologies employed. At this time, we are not aware of any internal process or customer issues that might lead to a significant increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenue in the foreseeable future.
At March 31, 2018, trade and notes receivables were $14,480 million prior to allowances of $187 million. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, our provision for bad debts was $44 million, $93 million and $113 million. At March 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables was 1.3% and 1.7%. An increase or decrease of a hypothetical 0.1% in the 2018 allowance as a percentage of trade and notes receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision for bad debts of approximately $14 million. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst-case scenarios. Additional information concerning our allowance for doubtful accounts may be found in Schedule II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Inventories: Prior to 2018, we reported inventories at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”). Effective in the first quarter of 2018, we report inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventories determined using the LIFO method. Inventories for our Distribution Solutions segment consist of merchandise held for resale. For our Distribution Solutions segment, the majority of the cost of domestic inventories is determined using the LIFO method. The majority of the cost of inventories held in foreign locations is based on weighted average purchase price using the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”). Rebates, cash discounts and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory are considered as product discounts and are accounted for as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized when the inventory is sold. Total inventories, net were $16,310 million and $15,278 million at March 31, 2018 and 2017.

McKESSON CORPORATION
FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

The LIFO method was used to value approximately 63% and 70% of our inventories at March 31, 2018 and 2017. If we had used the FIFO method of inventory valuation, inventories would have been approximately $906 million and $1,005 million higher than the amounts reported at March 31, 2018 and 2017. These amounts are equivalent to our LIFO reserves. Our LIFO valuation amount includes both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products. We recognized net LIFO credits of $99 million and $7 million in 2018 and 2017 and net LIFO charges of $244 million in 2016 within our consolidated statements of operations. A LIFO charge is recognized when the net effect of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory exceeds the impact of price declines including the effect of branded pharmaceutical products that have lost market exclusivity. A LIFO credit is recognized when the net effect of price declines exceeds the impact of price increases on pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical products held in inventory.
We believe that the average inventory costing method provides a reasonable estimation of the current cost of replacing inventory (i.e., “market”).  As such, our LIFO inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO or market.  As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, inventories at LIFO did not exceed market.
In determining whether inventory valuation allowance is required, we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow-moving inventory by reviewing on-hand quantities, outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales. Shifts in market trends and conditions, changes in customer preferences due to the introduction of generic drugs or new pharmaceutical products or the loss of one or more significant customers are factors that could affect the value of our inventories. We write down inventories which are considered excess and obsolete as a result of these reviews. These factors could make our estimates of inventory valuation differ from actual results.
Business Combinations: We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.
Several valuation methods may be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows associated with each asset. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. Refer to Financial Note 6, “Business Combinations,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our acquisitions.
Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets: As a result of acquiring businesses, we have $10,924 million and $10,586 million of goodwill at March 31, 2018 and 2017, $4,102 million and $3,665 million of intangible assets, net at March 31, 2018 and 2017. We perform an impairment test on goodwill balances annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant declines in performance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in the use of the assets, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in the Company’s stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time.
Goodwill impairment testing is conducted at the reporting unit level, which is generally defined as an operating segment or a component, one level below our Distribution Solutions and Technology Solutions operating segments, for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that reporting unit.
In 2018, we elected to early adopt on a prospective basis, the amended guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the second step of the impairment test. The one-step impairment test under the amended guidance requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, if any.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

To estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value by comparing the business to similar businesses, or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate expected rate of return. In addition, we compare the aggregate of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization as further corroboration of the fair values.
Estimates of fair value result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions at a point in time. Judgments made in determining an estimate of fair value may materially impact our results of operations.  The valuations are based on information available as of the impairment review date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Any material changes in key assumptions, including failure to meet business plans, negative changes in government reimbursement rates, deterioration in the U.S. and global financial markets, an increase in interest rate or an increase in the cost of equity financing by market participants within the industry or other unanticipated events and circumstances, may decrease the projected cash flows or increase the discount rates and could potentially result in an impairment charge. For example, some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the goodwill impairment estimation process using the market approach include the selection of appropriate guideline companies, the determination of market value multiples for both the guideline companies and the reporting unit, the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in marketability between the business and the guideline companies and for the income approach, the required rate of return used in the DCF method, which reflects capital market conditions and the specific risks associated with the business.  Under the income approach, the fair value estimates in the goodwill impairment analysis are highly sensitive to the discount rates used in the discounting of expected cash flows attributable to the reporting units.  The discount rates are the weighted average cost of capital measuring the reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and percentage of equity in a company’s target capital. The unsystematic risk premium is an input factor used in calculating discount rate that specifically addresses uncertainty related to the reporting units’ future cash flow projections. Increases in the unsystematic risk premium increases the discount rate.
In 2016, we concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. In 2017, we recorded a non-cash charge to impair the carrying value of our EIS reporting unit’s goodwill. In 2018, we recorded non-cash charges to impair the carrying value of goodwill balance for our McKesson Europe and Rexall Health reporting units. Refer to Financial Note 3, “Goodwill Impairment Charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Commencing in the first quarter of 2019, our operating structure will be realigned into three reportable segments, U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, European Pharmaceutical Solutions and Medical-Surgical Solutions. All remaining operating segments and business activities that are not significant enough to be reportable segments are combined into Other.
This change in our operating segment structure will result in two new reporting units within the European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment. As a result, we will be required to perform a goodwill impairment test for the impacted new reporting units immediately before and after the segment change. While we believe the assumptions used in our 2018 impairment analysis are reasonable and representative of expected results for our 2018 reporting unit structure, we may recognize an additional goodwill impairment charge immediately after the segment change as the reassigned carrying values of the reporting units may exceed their respective estimated fair values. We are currently evaluating the impact and are unable to reasonably estimate the additional goodwill impairment charge upon the segment change. At March 31, 2018, the total remaining goodwill balance for these two reporting units was $1,851 million.
A further decrease in the estimated future cash flows, an increase in the discount rate and/or a decrease in the terminal growth rate, could also result in an additional goodwill impairment charge for these reporting units.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

Currently, all of our intangible and other long-lived assets are amortized or depreciated based on the pattern of their economic consumption or on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to 38 years.  We review intangible assets for impairment at an asset group level whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable.  Determination of recoverability of intangible assets is based on the lowest level of identifiable estimated future undiscounted cash flows resulting from use of the asset and its eventual disposition.  Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.  Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective.  They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. During 2018, we performed an impairment test of intangible and other long-lived assets, and recognized non-cash asset impairment charges of $479 million pre-tax ($443 million after-tax) for McKesson Europe and Rexall Health businesses to impair the carrying value of certain intangible and other long-lived assets. We utilized an income approach (DCF method) or a combination of an income approach and a market approach for estimating the fair value of intangible assets. The fair value of the intangible assets is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company specific information. There were no material impairments of intangibles and other long-lived assets in 2017 or 2016 within our continuing operations.  Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in further impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Refer to Financial Note 4, “Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Supplier Reserves: We establish reserves against amounts due from suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them. These reserve estimates are established based on judgment after considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available. We evaluate the amounts due from suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. As of March 31, 2018 and 2017, supplier reserves were $227 million and $201 million. The final outcome of any outstanding claims may differ from our estimate. All of the supplier reserves at March 31, 2018 and 2017 pertain to our Distribution Solutions segment. An increase or decrease in the supplier reserve as a hypothetical 0.1% of trade payables at March 31, 2018 would result in an increase or decrease in the cost of sales of approximately $32 million in 2018. The selected 0.1% hypothetical change does not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios.
Income Taxes: Our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax provision and in evaluating income tax uncertainties. We review our tax positions at the end of each quarter and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative net operating losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future federal, state and foreign pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.
Changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Should tax laws change, including those laws pertaining to LIFO, our tax expense and cash flows could be materially impacted.
In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex new tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive new tax legislation referred to as the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. Although our accounting for the impact of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete, we have made estimates based on management judgment and recorded provisional amounts. Refer to Financial Note 10, “Income Taxes,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information.

FINANCIAL REVIEW (Continued)

We recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, a reduction to income tax expense may be recognized.
Loss Contingencies: We are subject to various claims, including claims with customers and vendors, pending and potential legal actions for damages, investigations relating to governmental laws and regulations and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be reevaluated at least quarterly to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, disclosure of the proceeding is provided.
Disclosure is also provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of the loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimate.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect our available cash generated from operations and our short-term investment portfolio, together with our existing sources of liquidity from our credit facilities and commercial paper issuance, will be sufficient to fund our long-term and short-term capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. In addition, we may access the long-term debt capital markets from time to time.
Net cash flow provided from operating activities was $4,345 million in 2018 compared to $4,744 million in 2017 and $3,672 million in 2016. Operating activities for 2018 were primarily affected by a decrease in receivables primarily due to timing of receipts and loss of customers and increases in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases. Operating activities for 2017 and 2016 were primarily affected by an increase in drafts and accounts payable reflecting longer payment terms for certain purchases and increases in receivables primarily associated with our revenue growth. Cash flows from operations can be significantly impacted by factors such as the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors. Additionally, working capital is primarily a function of sales and purchase volumes, inventory requirements and vendor payment terms. Operating activities for 2017 and 2016 included cash generated from our Core MTS business. Operating activities for 2017 were also affected by $150 million of settlement payment.
Net cash used in investing activities was $1,522 million in 2018 compared to $3,796 million in 2017 and $1,557 million in 2016. Investing activities for 2018 include $2,893 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, including $1.3 billion and $724 million for our acquisitions of CoverMyMeds, LLC and RxCrossroads, $405 million and $175 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, $374 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and other assets and $126 million cash payment received related to the Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange.
Investing activities for 2017 included $4,237 million of net cash payments for acquisitions including $2.1 billion for our acquisition of Rexall Health, $1,228 million of net payments received on Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange, $404 million and $158 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $206 million of net cash proceeds from sales of businesses and equity investments. Investing activities for 2016 included $40 million of net cash payments for acquisitions, $488 million and $189 million in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, and capitalized software, and $210 million of cash proceeds from sales of our automation business and an equity investment.

Financing activities utilized $3,084 million, $2,069 million and $3,453 million of cash in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Financing activities for 2018 include cash receipts of $20,542 million and payments of $20,725 million from short-term borrowings (primarily commercial paper).  We received cash from long-term debt issuances of $1,522 million and made repayments on long-term debt of $2,287 million in 2018. Financing activities in 2018 also include $1,650 million of cash paid for stock repurchases, $262 million of dividends paid and $112 million of payments for debt extinguishments.
Financing activities for 2017 include cash receipts of $8,294 million and payments of $8,124 million from short-term borrowings.  We received cash from long-term debt issuances of $1,824 million and made repayments on long-term debt of $1,601 million in 2017. Financing activities in 2017 also include $2,250 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $253 million of dividends paid.
Financing activities for 2016 include cash receipts of $1,561 million and payments of $1,688 million from short-term borrowings. We made repayments on long-term debt of $1,598 million in 2016. Financing activities in 2016 also include $1,504 million of cash paid for stock repurchases and $244 million of dividends paid.
The Company’s Board has authorized the repurchase of McKesson’s common stock from time-to-time in open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) programs, or by any combination of such methods. The timing of any repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, corporate and regulatory requirements, restrictions under our debt obligations and other market and economic conditions.
The Board authorized the repurchase of the Company’s common stock up to $4 billion in October 2016. In 2016, we repurchased 8.7 million of our shares through a combination of an ASR program and open market transactions. In 2017, we repurchased 14.1 million of our shares through open market transactions and 1.4 million of our shares through an ASR program. We received 0.3 million additional shares in April 2017 for the 2017 ASR program. In 2018, we repurchased 3.5 million of our shares through open market transactions and 6.7 million of our shares through ASR programs. We received an additional 0.5 million shares in April 2018 under the March 2018 ASR program.

At March 31, 2018, the total authorization outstanding was $1.1 billion available under the October 2016 share repurchase plan for future repurchases of the Company’s common stock. In May 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $4.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. The total authorization outstanding for repurchases of the Company’s common stock was increased to $5.1 billion.
We believe that our operating cash flow, financial assets and current access to capital and credit markets, including our existing credit facilities, will give us the ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing.

Return on McKesson stockholders’ equity (2) 0.6 54.6 26.0

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Ratio is computed as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Ratio is computed as net income attributable to McKesson Corporation for the last four quarters, divided by a five-quarter average of McKesson stockholders’ equity, which excludes noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests.

Cash equivalents, which are available-for-sale, are carried at fair value. Cash equivalents are primarily invested in AAA rated prime and U.S. government money market funds denominated in U.S. dollars, overnight repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities, Canadian government securities and/or securities that are guaranteed or sponsored by the U.S. government and an AAA rated prime money market fund denominated in British pound sterling.
The remaining cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several financial institutions. We mitigate the risk of our short-term investment portfolio by depositing funds with reputable financial institutions and monitoring risk profiles and investment strategies of money market funds.
Working capital primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, receivables and inventories net of drafts and accounts payable, short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, deferred revenue and other current liabilities. Our Distribution Solutions segment requires a substantial investment in working capital that is susceptible to large variations during the year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. Inventory purchase activity is a function of sales activity and other requirements.
Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017 primarily due to increases in drafts and accounts payable and a decrease in receivables, partially offset by an increase in inventories. Consolidated working capital decreased at March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the cash and cash equivalents balance and an increase in drafts and accounts payable and deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by increases in receivables.
Our debt to capital ratio increased for 2018 primarily due to a decrease in stockholders’ equity and decreased for 2017 primarily due to an increase in stockholders’ equity.
In July 2017, the Company’s quarterly dividend was raised from $0.28 to $0.34 per common share for dividends declared on or after such date by the Board. Dividends were $1.30 per share in 2018, $1.12 per share in 2017 and $1.08 per share in 2016. The Company anticipates that it will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.  However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid total cash dividends of $262 million, $253 million and $244 million. Additionally, as required under the Domination Agreement, we are obligated to pay an annual recurring compensation amount of €0.83 per McKesson Europe share (effective January 1, 2015) to the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe.

(2) Includes our estimated benefit payments, including assumed executive lump sum payments, for the unfunded benefit plans and minimum funding requirements for the pension plans. Actual lump sum payments could significantly differ from the estimated amounts depending on the timing of executive retirements and the lump sum interest rate in effect upon retirement. The estimated benefit payments do not reflect the potential effect of the termination of the U.S. defined benefit pension plan approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on May 23, 2018. Refer to Financial Note 30, “Subsequent Events” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Primarily represents interest that will become due on our fixed rate long-term debt obligations.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) A purchase obligation is defined as an arrangement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the Company. These obligations primarily relate to inventory purchases, capital commitments and outsourcing service agreements.

--- --------------------------------------------------------
(6) Represents minimum rental payments for operating leases.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(7) Includes agreements under which we have guaranteed the repurchase of our customers’ inventory and our customers’ debt in the event these customers are unable to meet their obligations to those financial institutions.

The contractual obligations table above excludes the following obligations:
At March 31, 2018, the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, was approximately $970 million. The ultimate amount and timing of any related future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty.
At March 31, 2018, we had a $90 million noncurrent liability payable to Change Healthcare shareholders associated with a tax receivable agreement entered into in connection with Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange. The amount is based on certain estimates and could become payable in periods after a disposition of our investment in Change Healthcare.
Our banks and insurance companies have issued $259 million of standby letters of credit and surety bonds at March 31, 2018. These were issued on our behalf and are mostly related to our customer contracts and to meet the security requirements for statutory licenses and permits, court and fiduciary obligations and our workers’ compensation and automotive liability programs.
The carrying value of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to McKesson Europe was $1.46 billion at March 31, 2018, which exceeded the maximum redemption value of $1.35 billion. The balance of redeemable noncontrolling interests is reported at the greater of its carrying value or its maximum redemption value at each reporting date. Upon the effectiveness of the Domination Agreement on December 2, 2014, the noncontrolling shareholders of McKesson Europe received a put right that enables them to put their McKesson Europe shares to McKesson at €22.99 per share, which price is increased annually for interest in the amount of 5 percentage points above a base rate published semiannually by the German Bundesbank, less any compensation amount or guaranteed dividend already paid (“Put Amount”).  The redemption value is the Put Amount adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations each period. The ultimate amount and timing of any future cash payments related to the Put Amount are uncertain.
