Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The Company’s corn processing operations and Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials. However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold. Thus, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.

The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 80 countries.  For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods. For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency. Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar.

The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, EBITDA, economic value added, manufacturing expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses. The Company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016

As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results. In Agricultural Services, U.S. export competitiveness was strong during the first half of the year but weakened during the second half due to the large crops in South America. Overall low market volatility continued due to surplus in the global market. In Corn Processing, demand and prices for sweeteners and starches remained solid in North America while co-product prices were stable. Ethanol continues to face a challenging environment. Although ethanol demand remained strong both in North America and export markets due to favorable gasoline blending economics and ethanol's continuing status as a competitive octane enhancer, U.S. industry ethanol production also remained at high levels which limited margins. Global oilseeds processing volumes remained strong, but ample supply of competing proteins and abundance of Argentine meal and oil in world markets pressured margins. Slow selling by farmers in Brazil continues to depress grain origination margins despite strong export volumes. While demand and margins for refined oil remained solid across all regions, uncertainty surrounding the U.S. biodiesel tax credit has negatively impacted biodiesel margins. Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients benefited from strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems, but continued to be adversely affected by start-up costs and margin pressure in certain non-flavor food ingredient markets.

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased $0.3 billion to $1.6 billion. Segment operating profit decreased $0.2 billion to $2.5 billion. Included in segment operating profit in the current year was a net charge of $134 million consisting of a net gain on sales of assets and businesses, impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges, and corn hedge timing effects. Included in segment operating profit in the prior year was income of $81 million consisting of a net gain on sales of assets and businesses/revaluation, impairment and restructuring charges, and corn hedge timing effects. Adjusted segment operating profit increased $47 million to $2.7 billion due to solid results in Corn Processing, partially offset by weaker South American origination margins, lower soybean crush margins, and weaker results in some specialty ingredients. Corporate results were a net expense of $927 million in the current year compared to $882 million in the prior year. Corporate results in the current year included a credit of $2 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a charge of $19 million in the prior year.

Income taxes decreased $527 million due to lower earnings before income taxes and a lower effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2017 decreased to 0.4% compared to 29.3% for 2016 due primarily to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”). Excluding the impact of the Act, the Company's effective tax rate for 2017 would have decreased from 29.3% to approximately 24.0% due primarily to the impact of changes in discrete tax items, including the favorable resolution of an uncertain tax position related to a 2014 acquisition and return to provision adjustments in the current year, partially offset by changes in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and the expiration of U.S. tax credits, including the biodiesel credit, at the end of 2016 (see Note 13 in Item 8 for more information).

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Analysis of Statements of Earnings

Processed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in metric tons):

-------------- ------ ---- ------ ------ -----

(In thousands) 2017 2016 Change
Oilseeds 34,733 33,788 945
Corn 22,700 22,273 427
Total 57,433 56,061 1,372

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. Processed volumes of oilseeds increased due to the strong demand environment for soybean meal and canola oil. The overall increase in corn is due to the strong demand environment for ethanol, partially offset by the production disruption in one of the Company’s plants due to a water main break in the first quarter and the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex.

Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

----------------------------------------- ------ ------ ---- ------ ------ ------ ------ - - ------ -

(In millions) 2017 2016 Change
Agricultural Services
Merchandising and Handling $ 23,127 $ 24,609 $ (1,482 )
Milling and Other 2,910 3,060 (150 )

Total Agricultural Services 26,246 27,893 (1,647 )

Corn Processing
Sweeteners and Starches 4,253 4,028 225
Bioproducts 5,099 5,438 (339 )
Total Corn Processing 9,352 9,466 (114 )

Oilseeds Processing
Crushing and Origination 14,091 13,976 115
Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other 8,169 7,880 289
Asia 270 296 (26 )
Total Oilseeds Processing 22,530 22,152 378

Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients 2,313 2,427 (114 )

Other 387 408 (21 )
Total $ 60,828 $ 62,346 $ (1,518 )

Revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes. In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds Processing and Agricultural Services, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.

28

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Revenues decreased $1.5 billion, or 2%, to $60.8 billion due to lower sales volumes ($1.4 billion) and lower average sales prices ($0.1 billion). The decrease in sales volumes was due principally to a decrease in volumes of unprocessed commodities, in particular volumes of soybeans, corn, rapeseed, and wheat. Agricultural Services revenues decreased 6% to $26.2 billion due to lower sales volumes ($1.5 billion) and lower average sales prices ($0.1 billion). Corn Processing revenues decreased 1% to $9.4 billion due to lower sales volumes ($0.1 billion). Oilseeds Processing revenues increased 2% to $22.5 billion due to higher sales volumes ($0.3 billion). Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients revenues decreased 5% to $2.3 billion due to lower sales volumes ($0.1 billion).

Cost of products sold decreased $1.4 billion to $57.3 billion due principally to lower sales volumes. Included in cost of products sold is a credit of $2 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to a charge of $19 million in the prior year. Manufacturing expenses increased $0.1 billion to $5.2 billion due to increased expenses for energy, operating and maintenance supplies, and contracted labor, and higher salaries and benefits.

Gross profit decreased $0.1 billion, or 3%, to $3.5 billion. Lower results in soybean processing ($152 million) and grain origination ($90 million) were partially offset by higher results in canola processing ($41 million), sweeteners and starches ($71 million), and animal nutrition ($53 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 31. The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a $2 million positive impact on gross profit compared to a negative impact of $19 million in the prior year.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $2.0 billion were comparable to the prior year. Current year expenses included increased salaries and benefits cost related to further investments in the Company’s business transformation, IT, research and development, and innovation initiatives. Prior year expenses included expenses related to the settlement of a legal matter.

Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased $118 million to $173 million. Current year charges consisted of $63 million of asset impairments in the Corn Processing segment primarily related to the reconfiguration of the Company’s Peoria, Illinois ethanol complex, $20 million of asset impairments in the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment primarily related to the closure of a facility, $54 million of restructuring charges in Corporate primarily related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company’s global workforce, and $36 million of several individually insignificant asset impairments and restructuring charges. Prior year charges included $11 million of software impairment in Corporate, $6 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company's investment in two available for sale equity securities in Corporate, and $17 million and $21 million of individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges, respectively.

Interest expense increased $37 million to $330 million primarily due to higher interest rates on short-term debt, the issuance of the $1 billion fixed-rate notes in August 2016, and interest related to an amended foreign income tax from a prior year, partially offset by the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017. Interest expense in the prior year also included a credit of $8 million for the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $164 million to $456 million primarily due to higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar resulting from the increased ownership stake in and higher results from Wilmar and improved results from the Company’s equity investment in CIP, partially offset by losses from a new equity investment and decreased earnings resulting from the disposal of an equity investment.

Other income - net decreased $110 million to $37 million. Prior year income included realized additional consideration related to the sale of the Company's equity investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. in December 2012, recovery of loss provisions and gain related to the sale of the Company's Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, a gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets. Current period income included gains related to the sale of the crop risk services business and disposals of other individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, partially offset by an adjustment of the proceeds of the 2015 sale of the cocoa business, changes in contingent settlement provisions, a charge related to the full redemption of the Company's $559 million notes due March 15, 2018, and foreign exchange losses.

Total Corporate $ (927 ) $ (882 ) $ (45 )

Agricultural Services operating profit increased 2%. Merchandising and Handling operating results increased due to improved Global Trade execution and strong destination marketing volume growth. Merchandising and Handling results also included a gain related to a confidential legal settlement, and a $42 million net recovery of property damage costs and business interruption losses related to the Company's New Orleans, Louisiana export facility. Milling and Other decreased due to lower volumes and margins. Transportation results decreased due to river conditions and lower barge freight volumes and margins.

Corn Processing operating profit increased 19%. Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased due to improved domestic demand and higher volumes and margins from the international business. Bioproducts profit increased due to improved lysine margins and higher trading resuts, partially offset by lower volumes caused by a mild winter and slightly lower ethanol margins.

Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 4%. Crushing and Origination operating profit decreased from the prior year. Higher softseed results in North America and Europe were more than offset by weaker soybean crush margins due to ample supply of alternative proteins competing with soybean meal. In addition, improved South American soybean crushing results were more than offset by weak grain origination margins throughout the year. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other operating profit declined due to weaker biodiesel and specialty oils margins partially offset by higher results in South American packaged oils and the global peanut business. Asia results increased on higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Wilmar due to the increased ownership stake in and higher results from Wilmar.

Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients (WFSI) operating profit increased 3%. The continuing strong demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems across all regions were partially offset by lower results in specialty ingredients, due in part to operational start-up costs.

Other operating profit decreased 62% primarily due to losses from the Company's captive insurance operations and lower results from its futures commission brokerage business. Current year results included settlement of insurance claims from the Company's Agricultural Services segment totaling $50 million related to the New Orleans, Louisiana export facility.

Corporate results were a net expense of $927 million in the current year compared to $882 million in the prior year. The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a credit of $2 million in the current year compared to a charge of $19 million in the prior year. Interest expense - net increased $28 million due principally to higher interest rates on short-term debt, the issuance of $1 billion fixed-rate debt in August 2016, and interest related to an amended foreign income tax return from a prior year, partially offset by the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017 and the absence of the original Harvest Innovation adjustment of buy-out liability in May 2016. Unallocated corporate costs increased $13 million due principally to increased investments in the Company’s business transformation, IT, research and development, and innovation initiatives partially offset by the absence of last year’s railroad maintenance expense. Other charges in the current year included a charge related to the full redemption of the Company’s $559 million notes due on March 15, 2018 and restructuring charges related to the reduction of certain positions within the Company’s global workforce. Other charges in the prior year included legal settlement costs and legal fees, a software impairment charge, other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company’s investments in two available for sale equity securities, a loss on the sale of an investment, and other asset impairment and restructuring charges, partially offset by a gain related to a U.S. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment. Minority interest and other expense increased $12 million due principally to lower results from the Company's equity investment in CIP.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes. Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted, where applicable, for specified items.

Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS, earnings before income taxes, and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015

As an agricultural commodity-based business, the Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s operating results. Agricultural Services was negatively impacted in the first half of the year 2016 by weak U.S. grain export competitiveness and decreased global merchandising opportunities. Starting in the third quarter, export volumes and margins improved due to the U.S. harvest and weather conditions in South America. In Corn Processing, global demand for sweeteners and starches and U.S. exports, principally to Mexico, continued to grow. In Europe, raw material costs improved, resulting in improved margins. Corn-based ethanol remained a very competitive transportation fuel, and domestic blending was strong as U.S. gasoline demand was up compared to 2015. U.S. ethanol also continued to be one of the cheapest oxygenates in the world, driving strong export volumes throughout 2016. Industry production levels remained high during the year, limiting margins. In Oilseeds Processing, global crushing operations achieved strong capacity utilization, although margins were weaker mainly due to higher supply of soybean meal from Argentina and other protein meal substitutes. Softseed margins improved due to better seed supply and oil demand. Vegetable oils continued to maintain a steady demand from the food industry. Additionally, vegetable oil sales volumes benefited from demand driven by the U.S. 2016 biodiesel blenders credit. The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients business benefited from increased demand for flavor ingredients and flavor systems, specialty proteins, natural health and nutrition products and polyols, but was adversely impacted by soft market conditions in non-flavor food ingredient markets and a strong U.S. dollar, as well as operational issues at the specialty commodities unit.

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests decreased $0.6 billion to $1.3 billion. Segment operating profit decreased $0.6 billion to $2.7 billion, primarily due to the 2015 gain on sale of the global cocoa and chocolate businesses and lower earnings in the year 2016 due to the sale of those businesses, weaker global crushing and origination margins, and lower international merchandising results, partially offset by better ethanol results. Corporate results in the year 2016 included a charge of $19 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves, compared to a credit of $2 million in the prior year and a decrease of approximately $70 million in the Company's share of the results of Compagnie Industrielle et Financiere des Produits Amylaces SA (Luxembourg) (CIP).

Income taxes increased $96 million due to a higher effective tax rate partially offset by lower earnings before income taxes. The Company's effective tax rate for 2016 increased to 29.3% compared to 19.2% for 2015 due primarily to low tax rates on significant gains related to portfolio actions in 2015, a $71 million 2015 discrete tax benefit resulting mainly from the release of a $66 million valuation allowance compared to a $49 million discrete tax expense in 2016, and changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings (see Note 13 in Item 8 for more information).

Analysis of Statements of Earnings

Processed volumes by product for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in metric tons):

-------------- ------ ---- ------ ------ ---- -

(In thousands) 2016 2015 Change
Oilseeds 33,788 33,817 (29 )
Corn 22,273 23,126 (853 )
Total 56,061 56,943 (882 )

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to current margin environment and and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. The overall decrease in corn relates to the disposal of the sugar ethanol operations in May 2016 partially offset by volumes from the acquisition of Eaststarch C.V. in November 2015.

Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients 2,427 2,407 20

Other 408 401 7
Total $ 62,346 $ 67,702 $ (5,356 )

Revenues and cost of products sold in a commodity merchandising and processing business are affected by the underlying commodity prices and volumes. In periods of significant changes in commodity prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Oilseeds Processing and Agricultural Services, generally have a relatively equal impact from commodity price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.

Revenues decreased $5.4 billion, or 8%, to $62.3 billion due to lower average sales prices ($3.5 billion), including $0.6 billion in foreign currency translation impacts, and lower overall sales volumes ($1.9 billion). The decrease in sales prices was due principally to lower underlying agricultural commodity prices, in particular prices of corn, soybeans, and soybean-related products. The decrease in sales volumes was due principally to the sale of the cocoa business and decreased sales volumes of ethanol and South American grain and oilseed origination. Agricultural Services revenues decreased 6% to $27.9 billion due to lower average sales prices ($2.5 billion) partially offset by higher sales volumes ($0.7 billion). Corn Processing revenues decreased 5% to $9.5 billion due to lower sales volumes ($0.5 billion) due principally to ethanol and the sale of the sugar ethanol business partially offset by sales volumes from the acquisition of Eaststarch C.V. Oilseeds Processing revenues decreased 12% to $22.2 billion due to lower average sales prices ($0.8 billion) and lower sales volumes ($2.3 billion) principally due to South American grains and oilseeds and the sale of the cocoa business. WFSI revenues were flat due to lower average sales prices ($0.2 billion) which were offset by higher sales volumes ($0.2 billion).

Cost of products sold decreased $5.0 billion to $58.7 billion due principally to lower average commodity costs, including $0.6 billion in foreign currency translation impacts, and lower manufacturing costs. Included in cost of products sold is a charge of $19 million from the effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves compared to a credit of $2 million in the prior year. Manufacturing expenses decreased $0.2 billion to $5.2 billion primarily due to the sale of the cocoa business, lower energy usage and prices, and decreased repairs and maintenance expenses.

35

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Gross profit decreased $0.3 billion, or 9%, to $3.6 billion. The decrease in gross profit consisted principally of lower soy crush margins ($309 million), reduced merchandising results ($95 million) primarily due to Agricultural Services global trade execution and positioning losses, lower volumes and freight rates in barge operations ($24 million), the sale of the cocoa business in 2015 ($78 million), partially offset by contribution of the recent Eaststarch C.V. acquisition ($85 million), and higher results in sweeteners and starches ($169 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 38. The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves had a $19 million negative impact on gross profit compared to a positive impact of $2 million in 2015. The decrease in underlying commodity prices did not result in a significant decrease in margins or gross profit as lower underlying commodity prices had a relatively equal impact on revenues and cost of products sold.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $2.0 billion were comparable to 2015. Decreased expenses related to the sale of the cocoa business and a U.S. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment gain were offset by legal settlements, costs, and legal fees, increased transaction fees due to increased trading volume from the brokerage business, and expenses for the recently consolidated Eaststarch C.V.

Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased $145 million to $55 million. Charges in 2015 included long-lived asset impairments of $129 million related to certain Oilseeds Processing facilities, sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil, a facility in the Corn Processing segment, and capitalized software costs and restructuring and exit costs of $71 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil, and several individually insignificant restructuring and exit costs. Charges in 2016 included $11 million of software impairment in Corporate, $6 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company's investment in two available for sale equity securities in Corporate, and $17 million and $21 million of individually insignificant fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges, respectively.

Interest expense declined $15 million to $293 million primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term debt and the $8 million effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $98 million to $292 million primarily due to lower earnings from the Company’s investments in Wilmar and CIP and a decrease in equity earnings from Eaststarch C.V. which is now fully consolidated following the acquisition of the remaining interest in November 2015, partially offset by increased earnings from other equity investees.

Other income - net decreased $203 million to $147 million. Income in 2015 consisted primarily of gain on sales of $256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa, chocolate, and lactic businesses, a gain of $212 million on the revaluation of the Company’s previously held equity investments in North Star Shipping, Minmetal, and Eaststarch C.V. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests, and a gain of $62 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the Barcarena export terminal facility in Brazil to Glencore plc, partially offset by a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt and loss provisions of $45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil. Income in 2016 included $48 million of realized additional consideration related to the sale of the Company’s equity investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. in December 2012, a $59 million gain, including recovery of loss provisions, related to the sale of the Company’s Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, a $12 million gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and a $10 million loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets.

Total Corporate $ (882 ) $ (988 ) $ 106

Agricultural Services operating profit decreased 16%. Merchandising and Handling operating results declined primarily due to compressed grain handling margins in the first half of 2016. International merchandising results were down driven by poor execution and low market volatility which limited forward merchandising opportunities partially offset by strong origination results in Argentina and the addition of destination marketing in Egypt through the Company’s Medsofts joint venture. Milling and Other results decreased 7% due to lower grain and feed margins. Transportation operating profit declined due to weak barge demand and lower freight rates.

Corn Processing operating profit increased 26%. Sweeteners and Starches operating profit increased as the business continued to perform well with higher volumes and pricing and improved margins from optimizing flex grind in the Company’s corn wet mills. The integration of the Eaststarch C.V. and Morocco acquisitions has progressed smoothly, significantly exceeding the Company's earnings accretion target. Bioproducts profit declined as weak ethanol margins continued due to high industry inventory levels.

Oilseeds Processing operating profit decreased 32%. Crushing and Origination operating profit declined driven primarily by lower global soy crush margins which were high in 2015, lower South American grain origination results caused by smaller soybean and corn crops in the region and year-over-year slower farmer-selling, partially offset by strong softseed volumes and margins in North America. Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel, and Other results improved due to good demand and improved margins for refined and packaged oils and improved European biodiesel results. Asia results declined due primarily to equity losses of $48 million from the Company’s investment in Wilmar that was recorded in the Company's results in the third quarter of 2016.

Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients (WFSI) operating profit decreased 5% due to weaker sales of hydrocolloids and fibers, a short edible beans crop impacting volumes and costs, and operational issues at the specialty commodities unit, partially offset by strong results in flavors and systems, polyols, and natural health and nutrition products.

Other operating profit increased on higher volumes from the Company’s futures commission brokerage business and improved results from its captive insurance operations.

Corporate results were a net expense of $882 million in 2016 compared to $988 million in the prior year. The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a charge of $19 million in 2016 compared to a credit of $2 million in the prior year. Interest expense - net declined $15 million due principally to lower interest rates on long-term debt and the effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations. Unallocated corporate costs increased $24 million due primarily to increased spending on the Company’s ERP program and various strategic business improvement projects. Other charges in 2016 included legal settlement costs and legal fees, a software impairment charge, other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company’s investments in two available for sale equity securities, a loss on the sale of an investment, and other asset impairment and restructuring charges, partially offset by a gain related to a U.S. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment. Other charges in 2015 consisted of the $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt, restructuring charges of $29 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, and asset impairment and settlement charges of $24 million. The increase in minority interest and other expense is due to a decrease of approximately $70 million in the Company’s share of the results of CIP.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of certain specified items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes. Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted, where applicable, for specified items.

Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company's operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS, earnings before income taxes, and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

The table below provides a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  The Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops that it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, and expanding its value-added product portfolio. The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of the Company’s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. The primary source of funds to finance the Company’s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility.  In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets.

Cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion for 2017 compared to $1.6 billion in 2016. Working capital changes increased cash by $0.3 billion in the current year compared to a decrease of $0.5 billion in the prior year. Trade receivables decreased $0.1 billion due to lower revenues and higher receivables sold under the accounts receivable securitization programs. Inventories increased $0.1 billion due to higher prices. The Company made a voluntary contribution to the U.S. pension plans of $0.2 billion in 2016. Cash used in investing activities was $0.9 billion this year compared to $1.2 billion last year. Capital expenditures and net assets of businesses acquired were $1.2 billion this year compared to $1.0 billion last year. Proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets of $0.2 billion in the current year were comparable to the prior year. Sales of marketable securities, net of purchases, were $0.4 billion this year compared to $0.3 billion last year. Investments in and advances to affiliates included additional investments in Wilmar of $0.3 billion this year compared to $0.6 billion last year. Cash used in financing activities was $1.0 billion this year compared to $0.6 billion last year. Long-term debt borrowings in the current year related to the $0.5 billion notes issued on September 14, 2017 compared to the prior year's $1.0 billion notes issued on August 11, 2016. Long-term debt payments in the current year of $0.8 billion primarily related to the full redemption of the $559 million notes due in 2018 and the retirement of the $261 million bond that matured in April 2017. The Company issued $0.5 billion notes in the current year for general corporate expenses and to pay down commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings in the current year were $0.7 billion compared to $0.1 billion in the prior year. Share repurchases were $0.8 billion in the current year compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

At December 31, 2017, the Company had $0.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.6 to 1.  Included in working capital is $5.9 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  At December 31, 2017, the Company’s capital resources included shareholders’ equity of $18.3 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling $7.7 billion, of which $5.5 billion was unused.  The Company’s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders’ equity) was 27% at December 31, 2017 and 2016.  The Company uses this ratio as a measure of the Company’s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  The Company’s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders’ equity) was 27% at December 31, 2017 and 26% at December 31, 2016.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $5.0 billion support a commercial paper borrowing facility, against which there was $0.7 billion of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $0.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.4 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on the Company’s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $4.5 billion, the Company has asserted that these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and provides for a one-time transition tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings. As a result, the Company recorded a transition tax liability of $270 million as of December 31, 2017 and expects to pay an estimated $43 million of this amount in 2018 (see contractual obligations and other commitments table in Item 7). In addition, due to the passage of the Act, the Company expects its effective tax rate before discrete item items to be between 20% to 23% in 2018.

The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. The Programs provide the Company with up to $1.6 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expands the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 19 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs). As of December 31, 2017, the Company utilized $1.4 billion of its facility under the Programs.

On November 5, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019. The Company has acquired approximately 86.2 million shares under this program as of December 31, 2017.

The Company expects capital expenditures of $0.8 billion during 2018. In 2018, the Company expects additional cash outlays of approximately $0.8 billion in dividends.

The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2017.

The three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company’s credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks.

Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the Company to make payments in the future.  The following table sets forth the Company’s significant future obligations by time period.  Purchases include commodity-based contracts entered into in the normal course of business, which are further described in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” energy-related purchase contracts entered into in the normal course of business, and other purchase obligations related to the Company’s normal business activities.  The following table does not include unrecognized income tax benefits of $56 million as of December 31, 2017 as the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement.  Where applicable, information included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes is cross-referenced in this table.

Interest expense declined $15 million to $293 million primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term debt and the $8 million effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $98 million to $292 million primarily due to lower earnings from the Company’s investments in Wilmar and CIP and a decrease in equity earnings from Eaststarch C.V. which is now fully consolidated following the acquisition of the remaining interest in November 2015, partially offset by increased earnings from other equity investees.

Other income - net decreased $203 million to $147 million. Income in 2015 consisted primarily of gain on sales of $256 million related primarily to the sale of the cocoa, chocolate, and lactic businesses, a gain of $212 million on the revaluation of the Company’s previously held equity investments in North Star Shipping, Minmetal, and Eaststarch C.V. in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interests, and a gain of $62 million on the sale of a 50% interest in the Barcarena export terminal facility in Brazil to Glencore plc, partially offset by a $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt and loss provisions of $45 million related to sugar ethanol facilities in Brazil. Income in 2016 included $48 million of realized additional consideration related to the sale of the Company’s equity investment in Gruma S.A.B. de C.V. in December 2012, a $59 million gain, including recovery of loss provisions, related to the sale of the Company’s Brazilian sugar ethanol facilities, a $12 million gain related to the revaluation of the remaining interest to settlement value in conjunction with the acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and a $10 million loss on sale of other individually immaterial assets.

Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients (WFSI) operating profit decreased 5% due to weaker sales of hydrocolloids and fibers, a short edible beans crop impacting volumes and costs, and operational issues at the specialty commodities unit, partially offset by strong results in flavors and systems, polyols, and natural health and nutrition products.

Other operating profit increased on higher volumes from the Company’s futures commission brokerage business and improved results from its captive insurance operations.

Corporate results were a net expense of $882 million in 2016 compared to $988 million in the prior year. The effect of changes in agricultural commodity prices on LIFO inventory valuation reserves resulted in a charge of $19 million in 2016 compared to a credit of $2 million in the prior year. Interest expense - net declined $15 million due principally to lower interest rates on long-term debt and the effect of the revaluation of the mandatorily redeemable 10% interest in Harvest Innovations. Unallocated corporate costs increased $24 million due primarily to increased spending on the Company’s ERP program and various strategic business improvement projects. Other charges in 2016 included legal settlement costs and legal fees, a software impairment charge, other-than-temporary impairment charges on the Company’s investments in two available for sale equity securities, a loss on the sale of an investment, and other asset impairment and restructuring charges, partially offset by a gain related to a U.S. retiree medical benefit plan curtailment. Other charges in 2015 consisted of the $189 million loss on debt extinguishment related to the repurchase of outstanding debt, restructuring charges of $29 million related principally to an international pension plan settlement, and asset impairment and settlement charges of $24 million. The increase in minority interest and other expense is due to a decrease of approximately $70 million in the Company’s share of the results of CIP.
