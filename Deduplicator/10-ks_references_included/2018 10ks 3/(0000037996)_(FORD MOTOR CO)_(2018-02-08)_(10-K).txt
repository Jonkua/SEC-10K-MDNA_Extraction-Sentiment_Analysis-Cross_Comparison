Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Automotive Segment

Liquidity. One of our key priorities is to maintain a strong balance sheet, while at the same time having resources available to invest in and grow our business. Based on our planning assumptions, we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to continue to invest in new products and services that customers want and value, transform and grow our business, pay our debts and obligations as and when they come due, pay a sustainable regular dividend at the current level, and provide protection within an uncertain global economic environment.

Our key balance sheet metrics include total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (collectively “Automotive cash”), Automotive liquidity, which includes Automotive cash and total available committed credit lines, and cash net of debt.

At December 31, 2017, we had $26.5 billion of Automotive cash, of which about 90% was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States. We target to have an average ongoing Automotive cash balance of about $20 billion. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic environment.

Our Automotive cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, corporate investment-grade securities, commercial paper rated A-1/P-1 or higher, and debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year, and is adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Automotive cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

In addition to our target Automotive cash balance, we also target to maintain a corporate credit facility, discussed below, for our Automotive business of about $10 billion to protect against exogenous shocks. We assess the appropriate long-term target for total Automotive liquidity, which includes Automotive cash and the corporate credit facility, to be about $30 billion, which is an amount we believe is sufficient to support our business priorities and to protect our business. At December 31, 2017, we had $37.4 billion of Automotive liquidity. Our Automotive cash and Automotive liquidity targets could be reduced over time based on improved operating performance and changes in our risk profile.

Changes in Automotive Cash. Changes in Automotive cash are summarized below:

In managing our Automotive business, we classify changes in Automotive cash into operating and other items. Operating items include: Automotive segment pre-tax profits, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, and all other and timing differences. Non-operating items include: separation payments, transactions with other segments, acquisitions and divestitures, changes in Automotive debt, contributions to funded pension plans, and shareholder distributions.

Automotive operating cash flow was $3.9 billion in 2017, more than explained by Automotive segment pre-tax profits. Automotive total cash outflow of $1 billion in 2017 includes $1.4 billion of funded pension contributions and $2.7 billion of shareholder distributions.

Capital spending was $7 billion in 2017 and is projected to be about $7.5 billion in 2018. Based on expected cash flows and the identification of additional opportunities for profitable growth, the ongoing amount of capital spending to support product development, growth, restructuring, and infrastructure is expected to be about $8 billion annually through 2021.

66

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

With respect to “Changes in working capital,” in general we carry relatively low Automotive segment trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our Automotive wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In addition, our inventories are lean because we build to order, not for inventory. In contrast, our Automotive trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms generally ranging between 30 days to 45 days. As a result, our cash flow tends to improve as wholesale volumes increase, but can deteriorate significantly when wholesale volumes drop sharply. These working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual summer and December shutdown periods, when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.

Available Credit Lines. Total committed Automotive credit lines at December 31, 2017 were $12.1 billion, consisting of $10.4 billion of our corporate credit facility and $1.7 billion of local credit facilities available to non-U.S. Automotive affiliates.  At December 31, 2017, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was about $35 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit.  At December 31, 2017, the utilized portion of the local credit facilities was about $1.1 billion.

Lenders under our corporate credit facility have commitments to us totaling $13.4 billion, with 75% of the commitments maturing on April 30, 2022 and 25% of the commitments maturing on April 30, 2020. We have allocated $3 billion of commitments to Ford Credit on an irrevocable and exclusive basis to support its liquidity. Any borrowings by Ford Credit under the corporate credit facility would be guaranteed by us.

The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of $4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the facility. If our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P (each as defined under “Credit Ratings” below), the guarantees of certain subsidiaries will be required.

Debt. Total Automotive debt at December 31, 2017 was $15.9 billion, unchanged from December 31, 2016.

U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturer (“ATVM”) Incentive Program. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding the ATVM loan.

Leverage. We manage Automotive debt levels with a leverage framework to maintain strong, investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of Automotive debt, underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Automotive income before income tax, adjusted for depreciation, amortization, interest expense on Automotive debt, and other adjustments. Ford Credit’s leverage is described in the Liquidity - Financial Services section of Item 7. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Automotive debt.

Financial Services Segment

Ford Credit

Funding Overview. Ford Credit’s primary funding and liquidity objective is to be well capitalized with a strong, investment grade balance sheet and ample liquidity to support its financing activities and growth under a variety of market conditions, including short-term and long-term market disruptions. Ford Credit’s funding strategy remains focused on diversification, and it plans to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels, and investors.

Ford Credit’s liquidity profile continues to be diverse, robust, and focused on maintaining liquidity levels that meet its business and funding requirements. Ford Credit annually stress tests its balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it continues to meet its financial obligations through economic cycles.

Funding Sources. Ford Credit’s funding sources include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transactions (including other structured financings). Ford Credit issues both short-term and long-term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investors, with long-term debt having an original maturity of more than 12 months. Ford Credit sponsors a number of securitization programs that can be structured to provide both short-term and long-term funding through institutional investors in the United States and international capital markets.

Ford Credit obtains short-term unsecured funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes under its Ford Interest Advantage program and by issuing unsecured commercial paper in the United States and other international markets. At December 31, 2017, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Interest Advantage notes, which may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holders thereof without restriction, was $5.5 billion. At December 31, 2017, the principal amount outstanding of Ford Credit’s unsecured commercial paper was $4.9 billion, which primarily represents issuance under its commercial paper program in the United States. Ford Credit maintains multiple sources of readily available liquidity to fund the payment of its unsecured short-term debt obligations.

Funding Portfolio. The chart below shows the trends in funding for Ford Credit’s managed receivables:

Managed receivables of $151 billion as of December 31, 2017 were funded primarily with term debt and term asset-backed securities. Securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables was 35%.

68

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Ford Credit expects the mix of securitized funding to remain around 35%. The calendarization of the funding plan will result in quarterly fluctuations of the securitized funding percentage.

Public Term Funding Plan. The chart below shows Ford Credit’s issuances for full-year 2015, 2016, and 2017, and its planned issuances for full-year 2018, excluding short-term funding programs:

In 2017, Ford Credit completed $32 billion of public term funding. For 2018, Ford Credit projects full-year public term funding in the range of $27 billion to $33 billion. Ford Credit’s total unsecured public term funding plan is categorized by currency of issuance. Ford Credit plans to issue its euro-denominated debt from the United States. Through February 7, 2018, Ford Credit has completed $4.3 billion of public term issuances.

69

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Liquidity. The chart below shows Ford Credit’s liquidity sources and utilization:

Ford Credit’s liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth, and timing of funding transactions. Ford Credit targets liquidity of at least $25 billion. At December 31, 2017, Ford Credit’s liquidity available for use was $29.5 billion, $2.5 billion higher than year-end 2016.

Ford Credit’s sources of liquidity include cash, committed asset-backed facilities, unsecured credit facilities, and the corporate credit facility allocation.

Ford Credit’s balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short-term nature of its finance receivables, investment in operating leases, and cash. Ford Credit ensures its cumulative debt maturities have a longer tenor than its cumulative asset maturities. This positive maturity profile is intended to provide Ford Credit with additional liquidity after all of its assets have been funded.

70

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure.

The chart below shows the calculation of Ford Credit’s financial statement leverage and managed leverage:

Ford Credit believes that managed leverage is useful to its investors because it reflects the way Ford Credit manages its business. Ford Credit deducts cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities) because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support its operations and amounts to support on-balance sheet securitization transactions. Ford Credit makes derivative accounting adjustments to its assets, debt, and equity positions to reflect the impact of interest rate instruments Ford Credit uses in connection with its term-debt issuances and securitization transactions. The derivative accounting adjustments related to these instruments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market interest rates. Ford Credit generally repays its debt obligations as they mature. As a result, Ford Credit excludes the impact of these derivative accounting adjustments on both the numerator and denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes in market interest rates.

Ford Credit plans its managed leverage by considering prevailing market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At December 31, 2017, Ford Credit’s financial statement leverage was 8.7:1, and managed leverage was 8.0:1. Ford Credit targets managed leverage in the range of 8:1 to 9:1.

Total Company

Pension Plan Contributions and Strategy. Our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plans, including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension assets relative to pension liabilities and the need for unplanned use of capital resources to fund the plans. The strategy reduces balance sheet, cash flow, and income exposures and, in turn, reduces our risk profile. We have made significant progress in implementing this strategy over the last several years. For example, we have limited liability growth by closing our funded plans to new participants and have reduced plan deficits through discretionary contributions. Going forward, we expect to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Limit our pension contributions to offset ongoing service cost or meet regulatory requirements, if any;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Continue progressively re-balancing assets to more fixed income investments, with a target asset allocation of about 80% fixed income investments and 20% growth assets, which will provide a better matching of plan assets to the characteristics of the liabilities, thereby reducing our net exposure; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Evaluate strategic actions to reduce pension liabilities, such as plan design changes, curtailments, or settlements

Worldwide, our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $6.6 billion at December 31, 2017, an improvement of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of asset returns, demographics, and contributions offsetting lower discount rates. Of the $6.6 billion underfunded status at year-end 2017, $6.5 billion, or about 98%, is associated with our unfunded plans. These are “pay as you go,” with benefits paid from general Company cash. These unfunded plans primarily include certain plans in Germany, and U.S. defined benefit plans for senior management.

The U.S. weighted-average discount rate decreased 43 basis points to 3.60% at year-end 2017 from 4.03% at year-end 2016. The non-U.S. weighted average discount rate decreased 11 basis points to 2.33% at year-end 2017 from 2.44% at year-end 2016.
Asset returns in 2017 for our U.S. plans were 13.4%, reflecting fixed income gains as long-term interest rates fell. The fixed income mix in our U.S. plans at year-end 2017 was 76%, one percentage point higher than year-end 2016. Asset returns for our non-U.S. plans were 4.5%, reflecting fixed income gains offset by unfavorable exchange. The fixed income mix in our non-U.S. plans at year-end 2017 was 80%, four percentage points higher than year-end 2016.

72

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

In 2017, we contributed $1.4 billion (most of which were mandatory contributions) to our global funded pension plans, an increase of $200 million compared with 2016. The contributions in 2017 included a pull-ahead of about $500 million of 2018 planned funding into the fourth quarter of 2017 to achieve a cash tax benefit. As a result of this pull-ahead, during 2018, we expect to contribute about $500 million (most of which are mandatory contributions) from Automotive cash to our global funded pension plans. We also expect to make about $350 million of benefit payments to participants in unfunded plans, for a combined total of $850 million. Based on current assumptions and regulations, we do not expect to have a legal requirement to fund our major U.S. plans in 2018. After 2018, we expect contributions to our global funded plans of about $1 billion per year, limited to ongoing service cost. Our global funded plans are now fully funded in aggregate, which is an important milestone demonstrating the effectiveness of our de-risking strategy and our commitment to a strong balance sheet.

For a detailed discussion of our pension plans, see Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Return on Invested Capital. We analyze total company performance using a Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”) financial metric based on an after-tax rolling five-year average, which we believe is appropriate given our industry’s product and investment cycles. The following table contains the calculation of our ROIC for the years shown:

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

CREDIT RATINGS

Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSROs”) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission:

•DBRS Limited (“DBRS”);
•Fitch, Inc. (“Fitch”);
•Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”); and
•Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, a division of McGraw Hill Financial (“S&P”)

In several markets, locally-recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies’ ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency.

The following rating actions were taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On January 30, 2018, Moody’s revised the outlook to negative from stable for Ford and Ford Credit and affirmed their ratings.

The following chart summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs:

2018 MAJOR EXTERNAL FACTORS ASSUMPTIONS

Based on the current environment, we have assumed the following for 2018:

We have assumed the following industry volumes:

•U.S. volume in the low-17 million unit range, including medium-heavy trucks, slightly lower than 2017;
•Brazil volume in the mid-2 million unit range, up roughly 20 percent from 2017;
•Total Europe volume in the low-21 million unit range, up slightly from 2017; and
•China volume in the mid-28 million units range, up slightly from 2017

We expect prices of most key metals to rise in 2018 and remain above the 10-year historical mean. We also expect continued headwinds from currency exchange rates.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

OUTLOOK

2018 Company Guidance

Based on the current economic environment, our Company guidance for 2018 includes the following:

We expect Company revenue to be about flat to up modestly as favorable Company-specific drivers more than offset slightly lower volumes in the United States.

We expect adjusted EPS in the range of $1.45 to $1.70. The low end of the range reflects the normal volatility we could see from recalls and further pressure from exchange and commodity prices. It also recognizes potential challenges in fully delivering the recovery actions we have developed and deployed to offset the adverse year-over-year impact of commodities and exchange. We also expect:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Automotive profit to be flat to lower than in 2017 with continued headwinds from commodities and exchange, and higher market factors driven by mix and net pricing;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Mobility to have a higher loss due to increased investments in autonomous vehicles and mobility-related capabilities and services; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ford Credit profit to remain strong but lower than 2017 due to adverse financing margin from interest rates and derivative revaluation.

We expect an adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 of about 15%, which is similar to 2017.

We expect to generate positive Company operating cash flow, though lower than 2017, driven by adverse working capital and unfavorable timing and other differences.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: 1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and 2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.

Warranty and Field Service Actions

Nature of Estimates Required. We provide warranties on the products we sell. Separately, we also periodically perform field service actions related to safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns. Pursuant to these warranties and field service actions, we will repair, replace, or adjust all parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship.  We accrue the estimated cost of both basic warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale.

Assumptions and Approach Used. We establish estimates for warranty and field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model. We use historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We reevaluate our estimate of warranty and field service obligations on a regular basis. Experience has shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile; therefore, our process relies on long-term historical averages until sufficient data are available. As actual experience becomes available, we use the data to modify the historical averages in order to ensure that the estimate is within the range of likely outcomes. We then compare the resulting accruals with present spending rates to ensure that the balances are adequate to meet expected future obligations. Based on this data, we revise our estimates as necessary. Warranty coverages vary; therefore, our warranty accruals vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale for specific periods of time and/or mileage. Field service actions are distinguishable from warranties in that they may occur in periods beyond the basic warranty coverage period. Our best estimate of the obligation related to field service actions includes expected future payments.

Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these factors, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 23 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information regarding warranty and product recall related costs.

Pensions and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits

Nature of Estimates Required. The estimation of our defined benefit pension and OPEB plan obligations and expenses requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as demographic experience and health care cost increases. Plan obligations and expenses are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).

Assumptions and Approach Used. The assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Discount rates. Our discount rate assumption is based primarily on the results of a cash flow matching analysis, which matches the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve based on high-quality bonds specific to the country of the plan. Benefit payments are discounted at the rates on the curve to determine the year-end obligations.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our expected long-term rate of return considers various sources, primarily inputs from a range of advisors for capital market returns, inflation, bond yields, and other variables, adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy by plan. Historical returns also are considered where appropriate. The assumption is based on consideration of all inputs, with a focus on long-term trends to avoid short-term market influences.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Salary growth. Our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience, long-term outlook, and assumed inflation.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Inflation. Our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators, including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation targets.

85

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expected contributions. Our expected amount and timing of contributions are based on an assessment of minimum requirements, cash availability, and other considerations (e.g., funded status, avoidance of regulatory premiums and levies, and tax efficiency).

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Retirement rates. Retirement rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Mortality rates. Mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Health care cost trends. Our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook, and an assessment of likely long-term trends.

Assumptions are set at each year-end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is a major plan event such as a significant curtailment or settlement that would trigger a plan remeasurement.

See Note 17 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding pension and OPEB costs and assumptions.

Pension Plans

Effect of Actual Results. The year-end 2017 weighted average discount rate was 3.60% for U.S. plans and 2.33% for non-U.S. plans, reflecting decreases of 43 and 11 basis points, respectively, compared with year-end 2016. In 2017, the U.S. actual return on assets was 13.4%, which was higher than the expected long-term rate of return of 6.75%. Non-U.S. actual return on assets was 4.5%, which was lower than the expected long-term rate of return of 5.19%. In total, these differences, in addition to demographic and other updates, resulted in a net gain of $131 million which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item.

For 2018, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is 6.75% for U.S. plans, unchanged from 2017, and 4.51% for non-U.S. plans, down about 70 basis points compared with a year ago, primarily reflecting an increased allocation to fixed income assets and a lower consensus on capital market return expectations from advisors.

De-risking Strategy. We employ a broad global de-risking strategy which increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation as funded status improves. Changes in interest rates (which directly influence changes in discount rates), in addition to other factors, have a significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio. As we de-risk our plans and increase the allocation to fixed income investments over time, we expect the funded status sensitivity to changes in interest rates will be significantly reduced. Changes in interest rates should result in offsetting effects in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio.

Sensitivity Analysis. The December 31, 2017 pension funded status and 2018 expense are affected by year-end 2017 assumptions. Sensitivities to these assumptions may be asymmetric and are specific to the time periods noted. The effects of changes in the factors which generally have the largest impact on year-end funded status and pension expense are discussed below.

Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our obligations and fixed income assets. The table below estimates the impact on our funded status of an increase/decrease in discount rates and interest rates (in millions):

----------------------------------- ------------ ------------------------------- ---------------

 Basis Increase/(Decrease) in
 Point December 31, 2017 Funded Status
Factor Change U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans
Discount rate - obligation +/- 100 bps. $5,000/$(6,200) $5,000/$(6,500)
Interest rate - fixed income assets +/- 100 (4,800)/5,900 (3,400)/4,400
Net impact on funded status $200/$(300) $1,600/$(2,100)

The fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return components (e.g., changes in credit spreads, bond coupon and active management excess returns), and growth asset returns. Other factors that impact net funded status (e.g., contributions) are not reflected.

86

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Interest rates and the expected long-term rate of return on assets have the largest impact on pension expense. These assumptions are generally set at each year-end for expense recorded throughout the following year. The table below estimates the impact on pension expense of a higher/lower assumption for these factors (in millions):

---------------------------------------------- ----------- ---------------------- --------------

 Basis Increase/(Decrease) in
 Point 2018 Expense
Factor Change U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans
Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 bps. $40/$(40) $10/$(10)
Expected long-term rate of return on assets +/- 25 (110)/110 (70)/70

The impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities. The sensitivity of pension expense to an increase in discount rates assumptions may not be linear.

Other Postretirement Employee Benefits

Effect of Actual Results. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide OPEB plans at December 31, 2016 was 4%, compared with 3.61% at December 31, 2017, resulting in a worldwide loss of about $293 million which has been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported as a special item.

Sensitivity Analysis. Discount rates and interest rates have the largest impact on our OPEB obligation and expense. The table below estimates the impact on 2018 OPEB expense of higher/lower assumptions for these factors (in millions):

---------------------------------------------- ------------ -------------------------------------- --------------------------------

Interest rate - service cost and interest cost +/- 25 N/A $5/$(5)

Income Taxes

Nature of Estimates Required. We must make estimates and apply judgment in determining the provision for income taxes for financial reporting purposes. We make these estimates and judgments primarily in the following areas: (i) the calculation of tax credits, (ii) the calculation of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes that will ultimately be reported in tax returns, as well as (iii) the calculation of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Changes in these estimates and judgments may result in a material increase or decrease to our tax provision, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.

Assumptions and Approach Used. We are subject to the income tax laws and regulations of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws and regulations are complex and involve uncertainties in the application to our facts and circumstances that may be open to interpretation. We recognize benefits for these uncertain tax positions based upon a process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the laws, regulations, and various related judicial opinions. If, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably to us, we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized. This process is inherently subjective, since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis, including consideration of changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Changes to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income taxes during the period in which the change occurred.

We must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income. GAAP requires a reduction of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.

We presently believe that a valuation allowance of $1.5 billion is required, primarily related to deferred tax assets in various non-U.S. operations. We believe that we ultimately will recover the remaining $10.2 billion of deferred tax assets. We have assessed recoverability of these assets and concluded that no valuation allowance is required.

For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses represents Ford Credit’s estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables and operating leases as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of Ford Credit’s allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. Because credit losses can vary substantially over time, estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses.

Nature of Estimates Required. Ford Credit estimates the probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables and operating leases based on several factors.

Consumer Portfolio. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses on consumer receivables and on operating leases using a combination of measurement models and management judgment. The models consider factors such as historical trends in credit losses and recoveries (including key metrics such as delinquencies, repossessions, and bankruptcies), the composition of Ford Credit’s present portfolio (including vehicle brand, term, risk evaluation, and new/used vehicles), trends in historical used vehicle values, and economic conditions. Estimates from these models rely on historical information and may not fully reflect losses inherent in the present portfolio. Therefore, Ford Credit may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable changes in recent economic trends and conditions, portfolio composition, and other relevant factors.

Assumptions Used. Ford Credit’s allowance for credit losses is based on assumptions regarding:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Frequency. The number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that are expected to default over the loss emergence period, measured as repossessions; repossession ratio reflects the number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that we expect will default over a period of time divided by the average number of contracts outstanding; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Loss severity. The expected difference between the amount a customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle.

Collective Allowance for Credit Losses. The collective allowance is evaluated primarily using a collective loss-to- receivables (“LTR”) model that, based on historical experience, indicates credit losses have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular accounts that are uncollectible cannot be specifically identified. The LTR model is based on the most recent years of history. An LTR for each product is calculated by dividing credit losses (i.e., charge-offs net of recoveries) by average net finance receivables or average net investment in operating leases, excluding unearned interest supplements and residual support, allowance for credit losses, and other (primarily accumulated supplemental depreciation). The average LTR that is calculated for each product is multiplied by the end-of-period balances for that given product.

Ford Credit’s largest markets also use a loss projection model to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio. The loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metrics, stratified by contract type (retail or lease), contract term (e.g., 60-month), and risk rating to Ford Credit’s active portfolio to estimate the losses that have been incurred.

The loss emergence period (“LEP”) is an assumption within Ford Credit’s models and represents the average amount of time between when a loss event first occurs to when it is charged off. This time period starts when the consumer begins to experience financial difficulty. It is evidenced, typically through delinquency, before eventually resulting in a charge-off. The LEP is a multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit losses.

For accounts greater than 120 days past due, the uncollectible portion is charged off, such that the remaining recorded investment is equal to the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell.

Specific Allowance for Impaired Receivables. Consumer receivables involved in Troubled Debt Restructurings are specifically assessed for impairment. A specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the contract’s original effective interest rate or the fair value of any collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell.

After establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit losses, if Ford Credit management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment.

88

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Sensitivity Analysis. Changes in the assumptions used to derive frequency and severity would affect the allowance for credit losses. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit’s U.S. Ford and Lincoln retail financing and operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions):

------------------------------ ------------------ -------------------

Assumption Basis Point Change Increase/(Decrease)
Frequency - repossession ratio +/- 10 bps $41/$(41)
Loss severity per unit +/- 100 5/(5)

Non-Consumer Portfolio. Ford Credit estimates the allowance for credit losses for non-consumer receivables based on historical LTR ratios, expected future cash flows, and the fair value of collateral.

Collective Allowance for Credit Losses. Ford Credit estimates an allowance for non-consumer receivables that are not specifically identified as impaired using a LTR model for each financing product based on historical experience. This LTR is an average of the most recent historical experience and is calculated consistent with the consumer receivables LTR approach. All accounts that are specifically identified as impaired are excluded from the calculation of the non-specific or collective allowance.

Specific Allowance for Impaired Receivables. Dealer financing is evaluated by segmenting individual loans by the risk characteristics of the loan (such as the amount of the loan, the nature of the collateral, and the financial status of the debtor). The loans are analyzed to determine whether individual loans are impaired, and a specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated costs to sell.

After establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit losses, if Ford Credit management believes the allowance does not reflect all losses inherent in the portfolio due to changes in recent economic trends and conditions, or other relevant factors, an adjustment is made based on management judgment.

Changes in Ford Credit’s assumptions affect the Financial Services interest, operating, and other expenses on our income statement and the allowance for credit losses contained within Financial Services finance receivables, net and Net investment in operating leases on our balance sheet.

Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases

Accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in Ford Credit’s operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term.

Ford Credit monitors residual values each month, and it reviews the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis. If Ford Credit believes that the expected residual values for its vehicles have changed, it revises depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating leases (equal to the acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation) will be adjusted to reflect Ford Credit’s revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. Such adjustments to depreciation expense would result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases and are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.

Each lease customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer.

Nature of Estimates Required. Each operating lease in Ford Credit’s portfolio represents a vehicle it owns that has been leased to a customer. At the time Ford Credit purchases a lease, it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle. Ford Credit estimates the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for its leased vehicles, industrywide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data.

Assumptions Used. Ford Credit’s accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on assumptions regarding:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Auction value. Ford Credit’s projection of the market value of the vehicles when sold at the end of the lease; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Return volume. Ford Credit’s projection of the number of vehicles that will be returned at lease-end.

See Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases.

89

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Sensitivity Analysis. For returned vehicles, Ford Credit faces a risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than its estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. The impact of the change in assumptions on future auction values and return volumes would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining terms of the operating leases. The effect of the indicated increase/decrease in the assumptions for Ford Credit’s U.S. Ford and Lincoln operating lease portfolio is as follows (in millions):

--------------------- ----------------- -------------------

Assumption Basis PointChange Increase/(Decrease)
Future auction values +/- 100 bps $(123)/$123
Return volumes +/- 100 23/(23)

Adjustments to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating leases would be reflected on our balance sheet as Net investment in operating leases and on the income statement in Financial Services interest, operating, and other expenses.

AGGREGATE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

We are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. Most of these are debt obligations incurred by our Financial Services segment. Long-term debt may have fixed or variable interest rates. For long-term debt with variable-rate interest, we estimate the future interest payments based on projected market interest rates for various floating-rate benchmarks received from third parties. In addition, as part of our normal business practices, we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials, components, and services to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services. These arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements. “Purchase obligations” are defined as off-balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms.
