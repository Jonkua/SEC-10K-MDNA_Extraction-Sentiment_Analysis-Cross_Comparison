Item 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business Overview

    Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and
distribute content and services on video game
consoles, PC, and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our games.

The King Acquisition

        On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion, as further
described in Note 20 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on February 23, 2016.

Reportable Segments

    As part of the continued implementation of our esports strategy, we instituted changes to our internal organization and reporting structure such
that the MLG business now operates as a division of Blizzard. As such, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, MLG, which was previously a separate operating segment, is now a component of the
Blizzard operating segment. MLG is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other
Activision Blizzard esports content.

    Based
upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments: Activision, Blizzard, and King.

(i)    Activision

    Activision is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platform.
Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that
distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.

(ii)   Blizzard

    Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard
primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that
distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, along with Activision's Destiny 2 content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. As noted above, Blizzard also includes the activities of our
MLG business, which is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision
Blizzard esports content.

(iii)  King

        King is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services, particularly on mobile platforms, such as Google's Android and
Apple's iOS. King also distributes its

content
and services on the PC platform, primarily via Facebook. King's games are free to play, however, players can acquire in-game items, either with virtual currency the players purchase or
directly using real currency.

Other

    We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including:

• the Studios business, which is devoted to creating original film and television content based on our extensive library of globally recognized
intellectual properties; and

• the Distribution business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to
third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Business Results and Highlights

Financial Results

    The Company's 2017 financial highlights include:

• consolidated net revenues increased 6% to $7.0 billion and consolidated operating income decreased 7% to $1.3 billion, as
compared to consolidated net revenues of $6.6 billion and consolidated operating income of $1.4 billion in 2016;

• revenues from digital online channels increased 13% to $5.5 billion, or 78% of consolidated net revenues, as compared to
$4.9 billion, or 74% of consolidated net revenues, in 2016;

• operating margin was 18.7%, as compared to 21.4% in 2016;

• cash flows from operating activities of approximately $2.21 billion, an increase of 3%, as compared to $2.16 billion in 2016;

• consolidated net income decreased 72% to $273 million, as compared to $966 million in 2016, primarily driven by the impact of
significant discrete tax-related impacts, including incremental income tax expense due to the impacts from the U.S. Tax Reform Act, as discussed in "Consolidated Results" below;

• consolidated net income included $113 million of excess tax benefits from share-based payments, as compared to $81 million in
2016; and

• diluted earnings per common share decreased 72% to $0.36, as compared to $1.28 in 2016, primarily driven by incremental income tax expense due
to the impacts from the U.S. Tax Reform Act.

    Since
certain of our games are hosted online or include online functionality that represents an essential component of gameplay and, as a result, a more-than-inconsequential separate
deliverable, we initially defer the software-related revenues from the sale of these games and recognize the attributable revenues over the relevant estimated service periods, which are generally less
than a year. Net revenues and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, include a net effect of $139 million and $71 million, respectively, from the deferrals of net
revenues and related cost of revenues.

Release Highlights

    Games and downloadable content that were released during 2017, include:

• Activision's four downloadable content packs for Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare™;
and one downloadable content pack for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare® Remastered;

• Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III Zombies Chronicles, a downloadable content pack of
remastered zombies maps from Call of Duty: World at War, Call of Duty: Black Ops, and Call of Duty: Black Ops
II;

• Activision's Crash Bandicoot™ N. Sane Trilogy, a remastered version of the first
three Crash Bandicoot games for Playstation 4;

• Activision's Destiny 2, the sequel to Destiny,
and Curse of Osiris, the first expansion to Destiny 2;

• Activision's Call of Duty: WWII;

• Blizzard's latest expansions to Hearthstone—Journey to Un'Goro™, Knights of the Frozen
Throne™, and Kobolds and Catacombs™;

• Blizzard's Rise of the Necromancer™, a downloadable content pack for Diablo III; and

• King's Bubble Witch 3 Saga™.

    We
also completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League, the first major global professional esports league with city-based teams. The first preseason matches occurred in
December 2017 and the inaugural regular season started in January 2018.

International Sales

    International sales are a fundamental part of our business. An important element of our international strategy is to develop content that is
specifically directed toward local cultures and customs. Net revenues from international sales accounted for approximately 55%, 55%, and 52% of our total consolidated net revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The majority of our net revenues from foreign countries are generated by consumers in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, foreign currency exchange rate
volatility and changes in local economies. Accordingly, our future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in local economies

Operating Metrics

    The following operating metrics are key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business.

Monthly Active Users

    We monitor monthly active users ("MAUs") as a key measure of the overall size of our user base. MAUs are the number of individuals who accessed
a particular game in a given month. We calculate average MAUs in a period by adding the total number of MAUs in each of the months in a given period and dividing that total by the number of months in
the period. An individual who accesses two of our games would be counted as two users. In addition, due to technical limitations, for Activision and King, an individual who accesses the same game on
two platforms or devices in the relevant period would be counted as two users. For Blizzard, an individual who accesses the same game on two platforms or devices in the relevant period would generally
be counted as a single user.

40

Table of Contents

    The
number of MAUs for a given period can be significantly impacted by the timing of new content releases, since new releases may cause a temporary surge in MAUs. Accordingly, although
we believe that overall trending in the number of MAUs can be a meaningful performance metric, period-to-period fluctuations may not be indicative of longer-term trends. The following table details
our average MAUs on a sequential quarterly basis for each of our reportable segments (amounts in millions):

---------- - ----------------- --- ------------------ - ------------- - -------------- --- ----------------- - ------------------ - - --- - - --- -
 December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 September 30, 2016
Activision 55 49 47 48 51 46
Blizzard 40 42 46 41 41 42
King 290 293 314 342 355 394
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Total 385 384 407 431 447 482
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

    Average
MAUs for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were comparable to the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in King's and Blizzard's average MAUs is
partially offset by an increase in Activision's average MAUs driven by the Call of Duty franchise due to the launch of Call of Duty: WWII in November
2017.

    Average
MAUs decreased by 62 million, or 14%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in King's
average MAUs is due to decreases across King's franchises that are largely attributable to less engaged users leaving the network and maturity of titles.

Net Bookings

    We monitor net bookings as a key operating metric in evaluating the performance of our business. Net bookings is defined as the net amount of
products and services sold digitally or
sold-in physically in the period, and includes license fees, merchandise, and publisher incentives, among others. Net bookings were as follows (amounts in millions):

------------ -------------------------------- ----- ------------------------------- - ----- - ----- - --- - -----
 For the years ended December 31,
 Increase (Decrease) 2017 v 2016 Increase (Decrease) 2016 v 2015
 2017 2016 2015
Net bookings $ 7,156 $ 6,599 $ 4,621 $ 557 $ 1,978

2017 vs. 2016

    The
increase in net bookings for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• higher net bookings from King titles, as 2017 includes King net bookings for the full year, while 2016 only included King net bookings for the
partial period following the King Closing Date, as well as higher net bookings from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features;

• higher net bookings from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2 in
September 2017;

• higher net bookings from Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, as compared
to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare (which, when referred to herein, is inclusive of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
Remastered), the comparable 2016 title;

• higher net bookings from the continued strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, as compared to
prior catalog releases, driven by the downloadable content pack, Zombies Chronicles, which was released in May 2017, and the continued strength of
microtransactions; and

41

Table of Contents

• net bookings from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017.

    The
increase was partially offset by:

• lower net bookings from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, as compared to the performance of Call of Duty: Black Ops
III, the comparable 2015 title;

• lower net bookings from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016;

• lower net bookings from World of Warcraft, driven by the release of World of Warcraft:
Legion™ in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2017; and

• lower net bookings from the Skylanders® franchise, due to the release of Skylanders
Imaginators in October 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
increase in net bookings for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• new net bookings from King titles following the King Closing Date, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchise;

• net bookings from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016;

• higher net bookings from digital content associated with Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which was
released in November 2015, as compared to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, the comparable 2014 title; and

• higher net bookings from World of Warcraft, driven by the release of World of Warcraft:
Legion in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2015.

    The
increase was partially offset by:

• lower net bookings from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which was released in November 2016, as
compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the comparable 2015 title;

• lower net bookings from the Destiny franchise, as there were two expansion packs in 2015—House of
Wolves and The Taken King—but only one in 2016—Rise of
Iron;

• lower net bookings from Skylanders Imaginators, which was released in October 2016, as compared
to Skylanders Superchargers, the comparable 2015 title, as well as lower net bookings from standalone toys and accessories from the Skylanders franchise
in 2016; and

• lower net bookings from Guitar Hero® Live, which
was released in 2015, with no comparable release in 2016.

Management's Overview of Business Trends

Interactive Entertainment and Mobile Gaming Growth

    Our business participates in the global interactive entertainment industry. Games have become an increasingly popular form of entertainment, and
we estimate the total industry has grown, on average, 18% over the last three years. The industry continues to benefit from additional players entering the market as interactive entertainment becomes
more common place across age groups and as more developing regions gain access to this form of entertainment.

    Further,
the wide adoption of smart phones globally and the free-to-play business model on those platforms has increased the total addressable market for gaming significantly by
introducing gaming to new age groups and new regions and allowing gaming to occur more widely outside the home. Mobile gaming is now estimated to be larger than console and PC gaming and continues to
grow at a

Table of Contents

significant
rate. King is a leading developer of mobile and free-to-play games and our other business units have mobile efforts underway that present the opportunity for us to expand the reach of, and
drive additional player investment from, our franchises.

Opportunities to Expand Franchises Outside of Games

    Our fans spend significant time investing in our franchises through purchases of our game content, whether through purchases of full games or
downloadable content or via microtransactions. Given the passion our players have for our franchises, we believe there are emerging opportunities to drive additional engagement and investment in our
franchises outside of games. These opportunities include esports, film and television, and consumer products. Our efforts to build these adjacent opportunities are still relatively nascent, but we
view them as potentially significant sources of future revenues.

    As
part of our efforts to take advantage of the esports opportunity, during 2017 we completed the sale of 12 teams for the Overwatch League. The Overwatch League is the first major
global professional
esports league with city-based teams. The first preseason matches occurred in December 2017 and the inaugural regular season started in January 2018.

Concentration of Sales Among the Most Popular Franchises

    The concentration of retail revenues among key titles has continued as a trend in the overall interactive entertainment industry. According to
The NPD Group, the top 10 titles accounted for 36% of the retail sales in the U.S. interactive entertainment industry in 2017. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenues has historically been
derived from video games based on a few popular franchises and these video games were responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, the Call of Duty, Candy Crush,
World of Warcraft, and Overwatch franchises, collectively, accounted for 66% of our consolidated net revenues—and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income—for
2017.

    The
top titles in the industry are also becoming more consistent as players and revenues concentrate more heavily in established franchises. Of the top 10 console franchises in 2017, all
10 are from established franchises. Similarly, according to U.S rankings for the Apple App Store and Google Play store per App Annie Intelligence as of December 2017, the top 10 mobile games have an
average tenure of 22 months.

    In
addition to investing in and developing sequels and content for our top titles, we are continually exploring additional ways to expand those franchises. Further, while there is no
guarantee of success, we invest in new properties in an effort to develop future top franchises. In 2014, we released Hearthstone and Destiny, in 2015, we
released Heroes of the Storm, and in 2016, we released
Overwatch. Additionally, to diversify our portfolio of key franchises and increase our presence in the mobile market, on February 23, 2016, we
completed the King Acquisition.

    Overall,
we do expect that a limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our, and the industry's, revenues and profits in the
near future. Accordingly, our ability to maintain our top franchises and our ability to successfully compete against our competitors' top franchises can significantly impact our performance.

Recurring Revenue Business Models and Seasonality

    Increased consumer online connectivity has allowed us to offer players new investment opportunities and to shift our business further towards a
more consistently recurring and year-round model. Offering downloadable content and microtransactions, in addition to full games, allows our players to access and invest in new content throughout the
year. This incremental content not only provides additional high-margin revenues, it can also increase player engagement. Also, mobile games, and free-to-play games more broadly, are generally less
seasonal.

    While
our business is transitioning to a year-round engagement model, the interactive entertainment industry remains somewhat seasonal. We have historically experienced our highest sales
volume, particularly for Activision, in the year-end holiday buying season, which occurs in the fourth quarter. Following the acquisition of King, which focuses on free-to-play games which are
generally less seasonal, and as we otherwise make the shift to a year-round model, less of our revenues are generated
during the fourth quarter. For our reportable segments—Activision, Blizzard, and King—the percentage of our revenue represented by the fourth quarter in each of 2017 and 2016
was 36%, as compared to 46% in 2015.

Expected Upcoming Releases

    We expect to release World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth and our latest Call of Duty game in
the second half of 2018. In addition, we expect to deliver ongoing content for our various franchises, including expansion packs for Hearthstone and Destiny 2, in-game events for Overwatch, and map packs for Call of Duty:
WWII, as well as releases of remastered versions of titles from our library of IP. We also expect to release at least two new mobile titles during 2018, including a social
casino game from King.

    We
will also continue to invest in new opportunities, including new titles across our platforms, and continue to build on our advertising and esports initiatives.

Consolidated net revenues

2017 vs. 2016

    The
increase in consolidated net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• higher revenues from King titles, as 2017 includes King revenues for the full year, while 2016 only included King revenues for the partial
period following the King Closing Date, as well as higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features;

• higher revenues recognized from the continued strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, as
compared to prior catalog releases, driven by the downloadable content pack, Zombies Chronicles, which was released in May 2017, and the continued
strength of microtransactions;

• revenues from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017; and

• higher revenues recognized from Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, as
compared to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, the comparable 2016 title.

    The
increase was partially offset by:

• lower revenues recognized from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, as compared to the performance
of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the comparable 2015 title; and

• lower revenues from the Skylanders franchise, due to the release of Skylanders Imaginators in
October 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
increase in consolidated net revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• new revenues from King titles following the King Closing Date, primarily driven by the Candy Crush franchise;

• revenues recognized from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016; and

• higher revenues recognized in 2016 from Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which was released in the
fourth quarter of 2015 and was the third game in our successful Black Ops series, as compared to revenues recognized in 2015 from Call of Duty: Advanced
Warfare, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2014, including, in each case, the associated digital content.

    The
increase was partially offset by:

• lower revenues recognized from the Destiny franchise, as Destiny debuted in September 2014 but
had no comparable full-game release in 2015;

• lower revenues from Skylanders Imaginators, which was released in October 2016, as compared to Skylanders
Superchargers, the comparable 2015 title, as well as lower revenues from standalone toys and accessories from the Skylanders franchise in
2016; and

• lower revenues recognized from the Diablo franchise due to the timing of releases.

Change in Deferred Revenues Recognized

 2017 vs. 2016

    The
decrease in net deferred revenues recognized for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• a net deferral of revenues for the Destiny franchise, primarily due to Destiny 2, which was
released in September 2017, as compared to net deferred revenues recognized in the comparable prior period; and

• a higher net deferral of revenues from the Call of Duty franchise, primarily due to the stronger performance of Call of
Duty: WWII in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare in the fourth quarter of 2016.

    The
decrease was partially offset by:

• net deferred revenues recognized from Overwatch in 2017, as compared to a net deferral of
revenues in 2016 due to the release of Overwatch in May 2016; and

• net deferred revenues recognized from World of Warcraft in 2017, as compared to a net deferral
of revenues in 2016 due to the release of World of Warcraft: Legion in August 2016.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
decrease in net deferred revenues recognized for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• deferrals of revenues associated with the release of World of Warcraft: Legion in August 2016,
as compared to the recognition of deferred revenues in 2015 from the release of World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor® in November 2014;
and

• deferrals of revenues associated with Overwatch.

    The
decrease was partially offset by lower deferrals of revenues associated with the Call of Duty franchise, driven by lower revenue deferrals from Call of Duty:
Infinite Warfare, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2016, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the comparable
2015 title.

Foreign Exchange Impact

        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $42 million, a negative impact of $81 million, and a negative impact of
$373 million on Activision Blizzard's consolidated net revenues in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to
changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the British pound.

Operating Segment Results

    Currently, we have three reportable segments. Our operating segments are consistent with the manner in which our operations are reviewed and
managed by our Chief Executive
Officer, who is our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"). The CODM reviews segment performance exclusive of: the impact of the change in deferred revenues and related cost of revenues with respect
to certain of our online-enabled games; share-based compensation expense; amortization of intangible assets as a result of purchase price accounting; fees and other expenses (including legal fees,
expenses, and accruals) related to acquisitions, associated integration activities, and financings; certain restructuring costs; and certain other non-cash charges. The CODM does not review any
information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis, and accordingly, no disclosure is made with respect thereto.

47

Table of Contents

    Our
operating segments are also consistent with our internal organization structure, the way we assess operating performance and allocate resources, and the availability of separate
financial information. We do not aggregate operating segments. As discussed in the "Business Overview" above, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, we made changes to our operating segments
which reflect the changes in our organization and reporting structure. Our MLG business, which was previously included in the non-reportable "Other segments," is now presented within the Blizzard
reportable segment. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect this change. This change had no impact on consolidated net revenues or operating income.

Segment Net Revenues

Activision

2017 vs. 2016

    The
increase in Activision's net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• higher revenues from the Destiny franchise, driven by the release of Destiny 2 in September
2017, with no comparable release in 2016;

• higher revenues from Call of Duty: WWII, which was released in November 2017, as compared to Call of Duty:
Infinite Warfare, the comparable 2016 title;

• higher revenues from from the continued strength of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, as compared to
prior catalog releases, driven by the downloadable content pack, Zombies Chronicles, which was released in May 2017, and the continued strength of
microtransactions; and

• revenues from Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, which was released in June 2017.

    The
increase was partially offset by:

• lower revenues from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare including its associated digital content, as
compared to the performance of Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the comparable 2015 title; and

• lower revenues from the Skylanders franchise, due to the release of Skylanders Imaginators in
October 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
decrease in Activision's net revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• lower revenues from Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which was released in the fourth quarter of
2016, as compared to Call of Duty: Black Ops III, the comparable 2015 title, which was the third game in our successful Black Ops series;

• lower revenues from the Destiny franchise, as there were two expansion packs in 2015—House of
Wolves and The Taken King—but only one in 2016—Rise of
Iron;

• lower revenues from Skylanders Imaginators, which was released in October 2016, as compared to Skylanders
Superchargers, the comparable 2015 title, as well as lower revenues from standalone Skylanders toys and accessories in 2016; and

• lower revenues from Guitar Hero Live, which was released in 2015 with no comparable release in
2016.

    The
decrease was partially offset by higher revenues from digital content associated with Call of Duty: Black Ops III, as compared to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, the comparable 2014 title.

Blizzard

 2017 vs. 2016

    The
decrease in Blizzard's net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• lower revenues from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016; and

• lower revenues from World of Warcraft, driven by the release of World
of Warcraft: Legion in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2017.

50

Table of Contents

    The
decrease was partially offset by:

• revenues recognized from franchise sales of city-based teams for the Overwatch League; and

• higher revenues from Diablo III, primarily due to the release of Rise
of the Necromancer, a downloadable content pack for Diablo III that was released in June 2017.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
increase in Blizzard's net revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• revenues from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016; and

• higher revenues from World of Warcraft, driven by the release of World
of Warcraft: Legion in August 2016, with no comparable release in 2015.

King

2017 vs. 2016

    The
increase in King's net revenues for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• 2017 including King revenues for the full year, while 2016 only included King revenues for the partial period following the King Closing Date;
and

• higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, due to in-game events and features.

2016 vs. 2015

    King's
2016 net revenues represent the net revenues from the King Closing Date through December 31, 2016. The revenues were primarily driven by the Candy Crush
franchise, which included the release of Candy Crush Jelly Saga™ in January 2016.

Segment Income from Operations

Activision

 2017 vs. 2016

    The
increase in Activision's operating income for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to higher revenues, as discussed above, and lower costs associated with
the Skylanders franchise, as there was not a new title released in 2017.

    The
increase was partially offset by higher sales and marketing spend on the Destiny franchise due to the release of Destiny 2.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
decrease in Activision's operating income for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to lower revenues, as discussed above. This was partially offset
by:

• lower sales and marketing spend on Guitar Hero Live and the Destiny franchise given the timing
of game launches; and

• the relative increase in revenues coming from the digital online channel, which typically has a higher profit margin.

51

Table of Contents

Blizzard

2017 vs. 2016

    The
decrease in Blizzard's operating income for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to lower revenues, as discussed above, along with higher product
development costs resulting from lower capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of game development cycles.

    The
decrease was partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs and software amortization for Overwatch and World of Warcraft: Legion, due to their
respective launches in 2016, with no comparable releases in 2017.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
increase in Blizzard's operating income for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to higher revenues. This was partially offset
by:

• new sales and marketing spending to support Overwatch; and

• higher personnel costs due to segment performance bonuses and increased headcount to support the business growth.

King

2017 vs. 2016

    The
increase in King's operating income for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• 2017 including King's results of operations for the full year, while 2016 only included King's results of operations for the partial period
following the King Closing Date; and

• higher revenues from the Candy Crush franchise, as discussed above.

2016 vs. 2015

    King's
operating income for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents the operating income from the King Closing Date through December 31, 2016.

Foreign Exchange Impact

        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $85 million, a negative impact of $30 million, and a negative impact of
$338 million on reportable segment net revenues for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the previous year. The changes are primarily due to changes in the
value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and British pound.

Cost of Revenues—Product Sales:

2017 vs. 2016

    Product
costs for 2017, were comparable to 2016, primarily due to lower product costs from the Skylanders franchise as there was no new release in 2017, offset by
higher product costs resulting from the increased revenues of our relatively lower-margin Distribution business.

    The
decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due
to:

• lower software amortization associated with Guitar Hero Live, which was released in October
2015;

• lower software amortization from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016; and

• lower software amortization from the Skylanders franchise as there was no new release in 2017.

    The
decrease was partially offset by higher software amortization associated with the Destiny franchise, primarily due to the release of Destiny
2 in September 2017.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
decrease in product costs for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• lower product costs associated with the Skylanders franchise; and

• the relative increase in revenues coming from the digital online channel, which typically have relatively lower product costs.

    The
decrease in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to product sales for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to lower software
amortization from the Destiny
franchise, as Destiny was released in the third quarter of 2014, but had no comparable full-game release in 2015.

59

Table of Contents

    This
decrease was partially offset by:

• software amortization from Overwatch, which was released in May 2016 with no comparable 2015
title; and

• higher software amortization associated with Call of Duty: Black Ops III, which was released in
the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which was released in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Cost of Revenues—Subscription, Licensing, and Other Revenues:

2017 vs. 2016

    The
increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to platform provider fees associated with the increase in
revenues from King.

    Software
royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for 2017 were comparable to 2016.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
increase in game operations and distribution costs for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• increased online costs and platform provider fees associated with revenues from King titles included following the King Closing Date; and

• increased expenditures to support our growing online activity across our existing and new titles.

    The
increase in software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses related to subscription, licensing, and other revenues for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily
due to a full year-to-date period amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition, while the comparable prior period only included the partial period
of amortization of internally-developed franchise intangible assets following the King Closing Date.

Product development $ 1,069 15 % $ 958 14 % $ 646 14 % $ 111 $ 312

2017 vs 2016

    The
increase in product development costs for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• higher Blizzard product development costs resulting from lower capitalization of software development costs due to the timing of game
development cycles; and

• increased product development costs for King, as 2017 includes King's costs for a full year, while 2016 only included King's costs for the
partial period following the King Closing Date.

 2016 vs 2015

    The
increase in product development costs for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• product development costs associated with King's titles for the period following the King Closing Date; and

• increased product development costs for Activision and Blizzard's current and upcoming releases.

Sales and Marketing (amounts in millions)

Sales and marketing $ 1,378 20 % $ 1,210 18 % $ 734 16 % $ 168 $ 476

2017 vs. 2016

    The
increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• higher sales and marketing costs for the Destiny franchise, given the release of Destiny 2 in
September 2017; and

• increased amortization of the customer base intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition and increased sales and marketing costs to
support King's titles, as 2017 includes a full year of costs, while 2016 only included King's costs for the partial period following the King Closing Date.

    The
increase was partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs for the Skylanders franchise as there was no new title release in 2017.

 2016 vs. 2015

    The
increase in sales and marketing expenses for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• amortization of the customer base intangible assets acquired in the King Acquisition;

• sales and marketing spending to support King's titles and new launches, including Candy Crush Jelly
Saga and Farm Heroes Super Saga™; and

• sales and marketing spending to support Blizzard's new title, Overwatch.

    The
increase was partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenditures on Guitar Hero Live and the Destiny franchise given the timing
of game launches.

General and Administrative (amounts in millions)

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 % of consolidated net revenues Year Ended December 31, 2016 % of consolidated net revenues Year Ended December 31, 2015 % of consolidated net revenues Increase (Decrease) 2017 v 2016 Increase (Decrease) 2016 v 2015
General and administrative $ 760 11 % $ 634 10 % $ 380 8 % $ 126 $ 254

2017 vs. 2016

    The
increase in general and administrative expenses for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to:

• increased personnel costs, including stock compensation expenses, to support the growth in our business and adjacent areas of opportunity;

• the inclusion of a non-cash accounting charge to reclassify certain losses included in our cumulative translation adjustments into earnings due
to the substantial liquidation of certain of our foreign entities, with no comparable activity in 2016;

61

Table of Contents

• restructuring charges, primarily severance costs, incurred in 2017 with no comparable activity in 2016; and

• higher foreign currency transaction losses.

    The
increase is partially offset by lower transaction costs as 2016 included the King Acquisition.

2016 vs. 2015

    The
increase in general and administrative expenses for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to:

• King's general and administrative costs, which are included from the King Closing Date;

• higher Blizzard personnel costs due to segment performance bonuses and increased headcount to support the growth of the Blizzard business;

• higher professional and transaction-related fees due to the King Acquisition, which closed on February 23, 2016; and

• lower foreign currency transaction and derivative contract gains.

Interest and Other Expense (Income), Net (amounts in millions)

Interest and other expense (income), net $ 146 2 % $ 214 3 % $ 198 4 % $ (68 ) $ 16

2017 vs. 2016

    The
decrease in interest and other expense, net, for 2017, as compared to 2016, was primarily due to our lower total outstanding debt and lower interest rates on our
current debt instruments as a result of our refinancing activities in 2016 and 2017. See further discussion below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

 2016 vs. 2015

    The
increase in interest and other expense, net, for 2016, as compared to 2015, was primarily due to interest expense associated with the new $2.3 billion
tranche of term loans "A" that were incurred in connection with the King Acquisition. This increase was partially offset by lower interest expense related to our prior term loan because of voluntary
prepayments on the principal we made throughout 2016, with the prior term loan being fully extinguished in September 2016. See further discussion below under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Income Tax Expense (Benefit) (amounts in millions)

    For
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, the Company's income before income tax expense was $1.15 billion, $1.11 billion, and $1.12 billion,
respectively, and our income tax expense was
$878 million (or a 76% effective tax rate), $140 million (or a 13% effective tax rate), and $229 million (or a 20% effective tax rate), respectively. Our full year 2017 effective
tax rate of 76% is higher than

62

Table of Contents

the
U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the one-time tax expense related to the U.S. Tax Reform Act (discussed further below) and changes in the Company's liability for uncertain tax
positions, partially offset by earnings taxed at relatively lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, recognition of excess tax benefits from shared-based payments, and research and development ("R&D")
credits.

    On
December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in
2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposes a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries ("Transition Tax").

    On
December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118"), which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax
Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 118 enables companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a
measurement period of up to one year, until accounting is complete.

    We
recorded a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in a charge of $636 million.
This includes current tax expense of $555 million related to the Transition Tax, which is payable over eight years, and deferred tax expense of $81 million related to the remeasurement
of deferred taxes resulting from the U.S. corporate income tax rate reduction. Accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act requires complex new calculations to be performed and
significant judgments in interpreting the legislation. Additional guidance may be issued on how the provisions of the U.S. Tax Reform Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different
from our interpretation. We may make adjustments to the provisional amounts as we collect and prepare the data necessary to finalize our calculations, interpret the U.S. Tax Reform Act and any
additional guidance issued, and consider the effects of any additional actions we may take as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.

    We
continue to analyze the prospective effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act, including new provisions impacting certain foreign income, such as global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI")
of foreign subsidiaries, base erosion anti-abuse tax ("BEAT"), and foreign-derived intangible income ("FDII"), potential limitations on interest expense deductions, and changes to the provisions of
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, among other provisions of the U.S. Tax Reform Act.

    In
2017 and 2016, our U.S. income before income tax expense was $185 million and $228 million, respectively, and comprised 16% and 21%, respectively, of our consolidated
income before income tax expense. In 2017 and 2016, our foreign income before income tax expense was $966 million and $878 million, respectively, and comprised 84% and 79%, respectively,
of our consolidated income before income tax expense.

    In
2017, 2016 and 2015, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions, as compared to domestic earnings taxed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, lowered our effective tax
rate by 24 percentage points, 22 percentage points, and 20 percentage points, respectively. The increase in the foreign rate differential is due to the overall increase in foreign
income, which is taxed at relatively lower rates in proportion to U.S. income.

    The
overall effective income tax rate in future periods will depend on a variety of factors, such as changes in the mix of income by tax jurisdiction, applicable accounting rules,
applicable tax laws and regulations, and rulings and interpretations thereof, developments in tax audits and other matters, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre-tax income or
loss. Further, the effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected by the extent that income (loss) before income tax expenses (benefit) is lower
than anticipated in foreign regions, where taxes are levied at relatively lower statutory rates, and/or higher than anticipated in the United States, where taxes are levied at relatively higher
statutory rates.

    On December 28, 2017, we received a Notice of Reassessment from the FTA related to transfer pricing concerning intercompany transactions involving one of
our French subsidiaries for the 2011 through 2013 tax years. The total assessment, including penalties and interest, was approximately €571 million ($680 million). We
disagree with the proposed assessment and intend to vigorously contest it. We plan to pursue all remedies available to us to successfully resolve this matter, including administrative remedies with
the FTA, and judicial remedies, if necessary. While we believe our tax provisions at December 31, 2017 are appropriate, until such time as this matter is ultimately resolved we could be subject
to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition to the risk of additional tax for years 2011 through 2013, if litigation regarding this matter were adversely determined and/or if the FTA were
to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.

    Further
analysis of the differences between the U.S. federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective tax rate, as well as other information about our income taxes, is provided in
Note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Foreign Exchange Impact

        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $27 million, a positive impact of $10 million, and a negative impact of
$242 million on Activision Blizzard's consolidated operating income in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The changes are primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to
the euro and British pound and its impact on our foreign operating income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    We believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. In the near term, we
expect our business and financial condition to remain strong and to continue to generate significant operating cash flows, which, in combination with our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments of $4.8 billion, our access to capital, and the availability of our $250 million revolving credit facility, we believe will be sufficient to finance our
operational and financing requirements for the next 12 months. Our primary sources of liquidity, which are available to us to fund cash outflows such as our anticipated dividend payments, share
repurchases, and scheduled debt maturities, include our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows provided by operating activities.

    As
of December 31, 2017, the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries was $3.0 billion, as compared to $1.9 billion
as of December 31, 2016. Following the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform Act and the current period expense on unrepatriated earnings, we no longer consider these available cash balances, which
primarily relate to undistributed earnings of our most significant foreign subsidiaries, to be indefinitely reinvested.

    Our
cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the fourth quarter due
to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions,
divestitures, joint ventures, share repurchases, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

    The primary driver of net cash flows associated with our operating activities is the collection of customer receivables generated from the sale
of our products and services. These collections are typically partially offset by: payments to vendors for the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of our products; payments for customer service
support for our consumers; payments to third-party developers and intellectual property holders; payments for interest on our debt; payments for software development; payments for tax liabilities; and
payments to our workforce.

2017 vs 2016

    Net
cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was $2.21 billion, as compared to $2.16 billion for 2016. The increase was primarily due
to:

• increased earnings after excluding the effects of charges due to impacts from the U.S. Tax Reform Act, which did not result in current year
cash outflows, and other non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expenses;

• a full year of King operating cash flows; and

• changes in our working capital due to the timing of collections and payments.

    Net
cash provided by operating activities for 2017 included $145 million of interest paid on our outstanding debt, as compared to $209 million paid in 2016.

2016 vs 2015

    Net
cash provided by operating activities for 2016 was $2.2 billion, as compared to $1.3 billion for 2015. The increase was primarily due
to:

• new operating cash flows contributed by King following the King Closing Date; and

65

Table of Contents

• higher net income in 2016, as compared to 2015, along with larger adjustments to net income for non-cash charges, primarily associated with the
amortization of the acquired intangibles in the King Acquisition, higher stock compensation expense due to converted equity awards for King personnel in the King Acquisition, and other non-cash or
non-operating costs associated with our debt-related activities during the year.

    Net
cash provided by operating activities for 2016 included $209 million of interest paid on our outstanding debt, as compared to $193 million paid in 2015.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

    The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with investing activities typically include capital expenditures, purchases and sales of
investments, changes in restricted cash balances, and cash used for acquisitions.

2017 vs 2016

    Net
cash used in investing activities for 2017 was $197 million, as compared to $1.2 billion for 2016. The decrease in the cash used was primarily due to
cash used for the King Acquisition in 2016, with no comparable transaction in 2017. The decrease was partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale investments, net of proceeds from maturities,
of $55 million in 2017, with no comparable transaction in 2016.

2016 vs 2015

    Net
cash used in investing activities for 2016 was $1.2 billion, as compared to $3.7 billion for 2015. The lower amount of cash used in investing
activities in 2016 was primarily due to a 2015 cash outflow of $3.6 billion for cash placed into escrow to facilitate the King Acquisition. In 2016, when we acquired King, the cash in escrow
became a cash inflow. As a result, in 2016 we had a $2.2 billion cash outflow for the King Acquisition in excess of the cash already in escrow, net of $1.15 billion of cash acquired from
King.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities

        The primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities typically include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term
debt and transactions involving our common stock, including the issuance of shares of common stock to employees upon the exercise of stock options, as well as the payment of dividends.

 2017 vs 2016

    Net
cash used in financing activities for 2017 was $624 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $500 million for 2016. The
changes were primarily attributed to our debt financing activities. For 2017, we had net debt repayments of $500 million, as compared to approximately $700 million of net debt proceeds,
inclusive of a premium payment, for 2016. The cash flows used in financing activities for 2017, were partially offset by:

• higher proceeds from stock option exercises in 2017 of $178 million, as compared to $106 million for 2016; and

• lower tax payments made for net share settlements on restricted stock units in 2017 of $56 million, as compared to $115 million
in 2016.

Table of Contents

2016 vs 2015

    Net
cash provided by financing activities for 2016 was $500 million, as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $202 million for 2015. The
difference was primarily due to $6.9 billion of proceeds received from the following debt issuances in 2016:

• issuance of a $2.3 billion tranche of term loans "A" on February 23, 2016 to fund the King Acquisition;

• issuance of an additional $250 million tranche of term loans "A" on March 31, 2016;

• issuance of a new unsecured $2.9 billion tranche of term loans "A" in connection with the fifth amendment to our credit agreement on
August 23, 2016;

• issuance of $650 million of 2.3% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 on September 19, 2016; and

• issuance of $850 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due September 2026 on September 19, 2016.

    These
issuances were partially offset by:

• repayments of $1.9 billion to extinguish our term loan outstanding at December 31, 2015 (the "Original Term Loan");

• repayments of $2.5 billion in connection with the refinancing of our tranche of term loans "A" that were provided in the first quarter
of 2016;

• repayments of $185 million on our new tranche of term loans "A" that were provided on August 23, 2016, which included
$167 million of voluntary prepayments, as compared to the $250 million partial repayment of our Original Term Loan in 2015;

• a cash payment to redeem all $1.5 billion of our outstanding 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September 2021, as well as the associated
$63 million premium; and

• higher cash dividend payments made during 2016, as compared to 2015.

    Net
cash used in financing activities for 2015 also included proceeds of $202 million received in the settlement of the litigation related to the October 11, 2013
repurchase of approximately 429 million shares of our common stock (the "Purchase Transaction"). There were no such proceeds received in 2016.

Effect of Foreign Exchange Rate Changes

        Changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $76 million, a negative impact of $56 million, and a negative impact of
$366 million on our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The change is primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to the Euro and British pound.

Debt

        As of December 31, 2016, our total outstanding debt was $4.9 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 2.92%. As a
result of the activities described below, our total outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017, was $4.4 billion, bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 3.58%.

    On
February 3, 2017, we entered into a sixth amendment (the "Sixth Amendment") to our credit agreement, which was originally executed on October 11, 2013 (as amended
thereafter and from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"). The Sixth Amendment: (1) provided for a new tranche of term loans "A" in an aggregate principal amount of $2.55 billion
(the "2017 TLA") and (2) released each of

subsidiary guarantors from their respective guarantees provided under the Credit Agreement. All proceeds of the 2017 TLA, together with additional cash on hand of $139 million, were used to
fully retire the term loans then outstanding (the "2016 TLA") under the Credit Agreement, including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The terms of the 2017 TLA, other than the absence of the
subsidiary guarantees, are generally the same as the terms of the 2016 TLA. The fees incurred as a result of the Sixth Amendment were not material. The 2017 TLA will mature on August 23, 2021.

    On
May 26, 2017, in a public underwritten offering, we issued three series of unsecured senior notes—$400 million of 2.6% unsecured senior notes due June 2022,
$400 million of 3.4% unsecured senior notes due June 2027, and $400 million of 4.5% unsecured senior notes due June 2047. The proceeds from these unsecured senior notes, together with
cash on hand, were used to make a prepayment of $1.2 billion on our 2017 TLA.

    During
the year ended December 31, 2017, we reduced our total outstanding long-term debt by $500 million. This included $139 million of cash used to retire the 2016
TLA, as discussed above, along with a prepayment on the 2017 TLA of $361 million. The prepayment made on our 2017 TLA satisfied the remaining required quarterly principal repayments for the
entire term of the Credit Agreement.

February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized repayments of up to $1.8 billion of the company's outstanding debt during 2018. As of the date hereof, we have not
made any additional repayments on our outstanding debt and the determination as to if and when we make any such repayment will be dependent on market conditions and other factors.

Dividends

        On February 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.34 per common share, payable on May 9, 2018, to
shareholders of record at the close of business on March 30, 2018.

    On
February 2, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share and we made an aggregate cash dividend payment on May 10, 2017 of
$226 million to shareholders.

Capital Expenditures

        We made capital expenditures of $155 million in 2017, as compared to $136 million in 2016. In 2018, we anticipate total capital
expenditures of approximately $155 million, primarily for leasehold improvements, computer hardware, and software purchases.

Commitments

        Refer to Note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for disclosures regarding our commitments.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements

        At December 31, 2017 and 2016, Activision Blizzard had no significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties,
often referred to as "structured finance" or "special purpose" entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes,
that have or are reasonably likely to have a material
current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates and assumptions. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. The policies, estimates, and assumptions discussed below are considered by management to be
critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and because their application places the most significant demands on management's
judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies,
estimates, and assumptions are described in the following paragraphs.

Revenue Recognition

        We recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product or service has been provided to the customer, the
collection of our fees is reasonably assured, and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. Certain products are sold to customers with a "street date" (which is the
earliest date these products may be sold by retailers). For these products, we recognize revenues on the later of the street date or the date the product is sold to the customer.

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

    Certain of our revenue arrangements have multiple deliverables, which we account for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
("ASC") Topic 605. These revenue arrangements include product sales consisting of both software, service (such as ongoing hosting arrangements), and hardware deliverables (such as peripherals or other
ancillary collectors' items sold together with physical "boxed" software).

    When
a revenue arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or services, we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price
hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if it is available, third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or best estimated
selling price ("BESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit
of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the
aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Further, if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then
allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.

    As
noted above, when neither VSOE nor TPE is available for a deliverable, we use BESP. We did not have significant revenue arrangements that required using BESP for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. The inputs we use to determine the selling price of our significant deliverables include the actual price charged by the Company for deliverables that the
Company sells separately (which represents VSOE) and the wholesale prices of the same or similar products for deliverables not sold separately (which represents TPE).

Product Sales

    Product sales consists of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. We recognize revenues from the sale
of our products after both (1) title and risk of loss have been transferred to our customers and (2) all performance obligations have been completed. With respect to digital full-game
downloads, this is when the product is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price
protection.

Product with Online Functionality or Online Hosted Arrangements

    For our software products with online functionality or that are part of an online hosted arrangement, we evaluate whether that online
functionality constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on (including
downloadable content), when it is released. Determining whether the online functionality for a particular product constitutes a more-than-inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires
management's judgment. When we determine that the online functionality constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate service deliverable in addition to the product, which is principally because of
the online functionality's importance to gameplay, we consider our performance obligation for this title to extend beyond the sale of the game. In addition, VSOE of fair value does not exist for the
online functionality of some products, as we do not separately charge for this component. As a result, we initially defer all of the software-related revenues from the sale of any such title
(including downloadable content) and recognize the revenues ratably over the estimated service period. In addition, we initially defer the cost of revenues for the title and recognize the cost of
revenues as the related revenues are recognized. The cost of revenues that are initially deferred include

70

Table of Contents

product
and distribution costs, software royalties and amortization, and intellectual property licenses and exclude intangible asset amortization.

    For
our software products with online functionality that are considered to be incidental to the overall product offering and are inconsequential deliverables, we recognize the related
revenues when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met.

    For
our World of Warcraft boxed products, expansion packs and value-added services, we recognize revenues in each case with the related
subscription service revenues ratably over the estimated service period, beginning upon the activation of the software and delivery of the related services. For revenues associated with the sales of
subscriptions, the revenues are deferred until the subscription service is activated by the consumer and are then recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenues attributed to the sale of World of
Warcraft boxed software and related expansion packs are classified as "Product sales," whereas revenues attributable to subscriptions and other
value-added services are classified as "Subscription, licensing, and other revenues."

Microtransaction Revenues

    Microtransaction revenues are derived from the sale of virtual goods and currencies to our players to enhance their gameplay experience.
Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods and currencies are initially recorded in deferred revenues. Proceeds from the sales of virtual currencies are recognized as revenues when a player uses the
virtual goods purchased with the virtual currency. Proceeds from the sales of virtual goods directly are also recognized as revenues when a player uses the virtual goods. We categorize our virtual
goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of consumable virtual
goods as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual goods represent goods that are accessible to the player over an extended period of time; accordingly, we recognize revenues from the sale of durable
virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the player, which is generally the estimated service period.

Estimated Service Period

    We determine the estimated service period for players of our games with consideration of various data points, including the weighted-average
number of days between players' first and last date played online, the average total hours played, the average number of days in which player activity stabilizes, and the weighted-average number of
days between players' first purchase date and last date played online. We also consider known online trends, the service periods of our previously released games, and the service periods of our
competitors' games that are similar in nature to ours, to the extent they are publicly available. Determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires management's judgment. Future
usage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated service period may change in the future. The estimated service periods for players of our current games are
generally less than twelve months.

Principal Agent Considerations

        We evaluate sales of our products and content via third party digital storefronts, such as Microsoft's Xbox Games Store, Sony's PSN, the Apple
App Store, and the Google Play Store, to determine whether revenues should be reported gross or net of fees retained by the storefront. Key indicators that we evaluate in determining gross versus net
treatment include, but are not limited to, the following:

• the party responsible for delivery/fulfillment of the product or service to the consumer;

• the party responsible for consumer billing, fee collection, and refunds;

71

Table of Contents

• the storefront and terms of sale that govern the consumer's purchase of the product or service; and

• the party that sets the pricing with the consumer and has credit risk.

    Based
on evaluation of the above indicators, we report revenues on a gross basis for sales arrangements via Apple App Store and Google Play Store, and we report revenues on a net basis
(i.e., net of fees retained by the storefront) for sales arrangements via Microsoft's Xbox Games Store and Sony PSN.

Allowances for Returns and Price Protection

        We closely monitor and analyze the historical performance of our various titles, the performance of products released by other publishers,
market conditions, and the anticipated timing of other releases to assess future demand of current and upcoming titles. Initial volumes shipped upon title launch and subsequent reorders are evaluated
with the goal of ensuring that quantities are sufficient to meet the demand from the retail markets, but at the same time are controlled to prevent excess inventory in the channel. We benchmark units
to be shipped to our customers using historical and industry data.

    We
may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. In general, price protection refers to the circumstances in which we elect to
decrease, on a short- or longer-term basis, the wholesale price of a product by a certain amount and, when granted and applicable, allow customers a credit against amounts owed by such customers to us
with respect to open and/or future invoices. The conditions our customers must meet to be granted the right to return products or receive price protection credits include, among other things,
compliance with applicable trading and payment terms and consistent return of inventory and delivery of sell-through reports to us. We may also consider other factors, including achievement of
sell-through performance targets in certain instances, the facilitation of slow-moving inventory, and other market factors.

    Significant
management judgments and estimates with respect to potential future product returns and price protection related to current period product revenues must be made and used when
establishing the allowance for returns and price protection in any accounting period. We estimate the amount of future returns and price protection for current period product revenues utilizing
historical experience and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer. The following factors are used to estimate the amount of future
returns and price protection for a particular title: historical performance of titles in similar genres; historical performance of the hardware platform; historical performance of the franchise;
console hardware life cycle; sales force and retail customer feedback; industry pricing; future pricing assumptions; weeks of on-hand retail channel inventory; absolute quantity of on-hand retail
channel inventory; our warehouse on-hand inventory levels; the title's recent sell-through history (if available); marketing trade programs; and the performance of competing titles. The relative
importance of these factors varies among titles depending upon, among other things, genre, platform, seasonality, and sales strategy.

    Based
upon historical experience, we believe that our estimates are reasonable. However, actual returns and price protection could vary materially from our allowance estimates due to a
number of reasons, including, among others: a lack of consumer acceptance of a title, the release in the same period of a similarly themed title by a competitor, or technological obsolescence due to
the emergence of new hardware platforms. There may be material differences in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if factors or market conditions change or if matters resolve in a
manner that is inconsistent with management's assumptions utilized in determining the allowances for returns and price protection.
For example, a 1% change in our December 31, 2017 allowance for sales returns, price protection, and other allowances would have impacted net revenues by approximately $3 million.

Software Development Costs

    Software development costs include payments made to independent software developers under development agreements, as well as direct costs
incurred for internally developed products. Software development costs are capitalized once the technological feasibility of a product is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable.
Technological feasibility of a product requires both technical design documentation and game design documentation, or the completed and tested product design and a working model. Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established and the evaluation is performed on a product-by-product basis. For products where
proven technology exists, this may occur early in the development cycle. Software development costs related to online hosted revenue arrangements are capitalized after the preliminary project phase is
complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Prior to a product's release, if and when we believe capitalized costs
are not recoverable, we expense the amounts as part of "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property licenses." Capitalized costs for products that are
cancelled or are expected to be abandoned are charged to "Product development" in the period of cancellation. Amounts related to software development which are not capitalized are charged immediately
to "Product development."

    Commencing
upon a product's release, capitalized software development costs are amortized to "Cost of revenues—software royalties, amortization, and intellectual property
licenses" based on the ratio of current revenues to total projected revenues for the specific product, generally resulting in an amortization period of six months to approximately two years.

    We
evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis. For products that have been released in prior periods, the primary evaluation
criterion is the actual performance of the title to which the costs relate. For products that are scheduled to be released in future periods, recoverability is evaluated based on the expected
performance of the specific products to which the costs relate. Criteria used to evaluate expected product performance include: historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable
technology; market performance of comparable titles; orders for the product prior to its release; general market conditions; and, for any sequel product, estimated performance based on the performance
of the product on which the sequel is based.

    Significant
management judgments and estimates are utilized in assessing the recoverability of capitalized costs. In evaluating the recoverability of capitalized costs, the assessment of
expected product performance utilizes forecasted sales amounts and estimates of additional costs to be incurred. If revised forecasted or actual product sales are less than the originally forecasted
amounts utilized in the initial recoverability analysis, the net realizable value may be lower than originally estimated in any given quarter, which could result in an impairment charge. Material
differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if matters resolve in a manner that is inconsistent with management's expectations.

Income Taxes

    We record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, the
provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is

73

Table of Contents

recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We evaluate deferred tax assets each period for recoverability. For those assets that do not meet the threshold of "more likely
than not" that they will be realized in the future, a valuation allowance is recorded.

    Management
believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax
effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be
realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to tax expenses in the period such determination is made. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant
judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of ASC Topic 740 and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations
could have a material impact on our business and results of operations in an interim period in which the uncertainties are ultimately resolved.

    Significant
judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance
can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of
changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded,
such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to
reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.

    Our
provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by: (1) earnings being lower than anticipated in foreign regions where taxes are levied at
relatively lower statutory rates and/or higher than anticipated in the United States where taxes are levied at relatively higher statutory rates; (2) changes in the valuation of our deferred
tax assets and liabilities; (3) tax effects of nondeductible compensation; (4) tax costs related to intercompany realignments; (5) differences between amounts included in our tax
filings and the estimate of such amounts included in our tax expenses; (6) changes in accounting principles; or (7) changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles
or interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational corporations. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes
prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of
previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the
IRS and are regularly subject to audit by other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for
income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.

    As
further described in "Consolidated Results" above, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Reform Act was enacted. The U.S. Tax Reform Act, among other things, reduced the U.S.
corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018 and implemented a modified territorial tax system that imposes a one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.

    On
December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act under ASC 740. SAB 118
enables companies to record a provisional amount for the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act based on a reasonable estimate, subject to adjustment during a measurement period of up to one year, until
accounting is complete.

    We
continue to analyze the prospective effects of the U.S. Tax Reform Act, including new provisions impacting certain foreign income, such as GILTI, BEAT, and FDII, potential limitations
on

74

Table of Contents

interest
expense deductions, and changes to the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, among other provisions of the U.S. Tax Reform Act. The Company has elected to account
for the U.S. Tax Reform Act provisions related to GILTI as period costs if and when incurred pursuant to the FASB Staff Q&A guidance issued in January 2018.

Fair Value Estimates

    The preparation of financial statements often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present in our consolidated
financial statements. Without an independent market or another representative transaction, determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently
difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting.

    There
are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value. These include: (1) the market approach, where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or
liabilities are used to determine the fair value; (2) the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts (for example, future cash flows or future earnings) to a
single present amount; and (3) the cost approach, which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset. For many of our fair value estimates, including our estimates of the
fair value of acquired intangible assets, we use the income approach. Using the income approach requires the use of financial models, which require us to make various estimates including, but not
limited to: (1) the potential future cash flows for the asset, liability or equity instrument being measured; (2) the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows;
(3) the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows; and (4) the inherent risk associated with the cash flows (that is, the risk premium).
Determining these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective, and, if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate, our
financial results may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial
models or the related accounting conclusion reached. For example, a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired. While we
are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions, the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments:

         Business Combinations.    Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair
value. Our
assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated
useful lives. Furthermore, a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill, which is an asset that is not amortized.
Often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of the expected use of the asset, the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations
related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired in-process technology. Such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our
financial statements.

         Assessment of Impairment of Definite-lived Intangible and Other Long-lived Assets.    We evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable
amortizable
intangible assets and other long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 360-10, which generally requires the assessment of these assets for recoverability when events or circumstances (referred
to as a "triggering event") indicate a potential impairment exists. We consider certain events and circumstances in determining whether a triggering event has occurred that could indicate the carrying
value of identifiable definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to: (1) significant changes in performance relative to
expected operating results; (2) significant changes in the use of the assets; (3) significant negative industry or economic trends; (4) a significant decline in our stock price
for a

75

Table of Contents

sustained
period of time; and (5) changes in our business strategy. If it is determined that a triggering event has occurred, we determine if an impairment exists based on an estimate of the
undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying values of the related asset group, an
impairment exists and the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the group's assets exceeds the fair value of the asset group. We did not record an impairment charge
to any of our definite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.

         Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets.    We are required to test goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment on an annual basis and, if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. ASC Topic 350 provides companies an option to first perform a qualitative assessment to
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value before performing a quantitative two-step approach to testing goodwill for
impairment. We perform our impairment test for each reporting unit as part of our annual impairment test performed as of December 31. Our reporting units are determined based on the guidance
within ASC Subtopic 350-20. The first step of the quantitative test measures for impairment by applying fair value-based tests at the reporting unit level. The second step (if necessary) measures the
amount of impairment by applying fair value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit.

    To
determine the fair values of the reporting units used in the first step, we use a discounted cash flow approach. Each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of
significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include long-term growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates
based on our weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. These estimates and assumptions must be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment. Our estimates
for market growth, our market share and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and certain external sources, and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and
estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. If future forecasts are revised, they may indicate or require future impairment charges. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we
believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.

    In
determining the fair value of our significant reporting units—namely Activision, Blizzard, and King—we assumed discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 11.5% and
terminal growth rates of 0.0% to 4.0%, depending on the reporting unit and its specific characteristics and risk profiles. Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined the estimated fair value
of all of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2017. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future
financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in future impairment charges

    We
test our acquired trade names for possible impairment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we concluded that no
impairment had occurred and that no impairment was reasonably likely to occur. In determining the fair value of these trade names, we assumed a discount rate of 8.5%, and royalty saving rates of
approximately 1.5%. Changes in our assumptions underlying our estimates of fair value, which will be a function of our future financial performance and changes in economic conditions, could result in
future impairment charges.

Share-Based Payments

        We account for share-based payments in accordance with ASC Subtopic 718-10 and ASC Subtopic 505-50. Share-based compensation
expense for a given grant is recognized over the requisite service period (that is, the period for which the employee is being compensated) and is based on the

76

Table of Contents

value
of share-based payment awards after a reduction for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates.

    We
generally estimate the value of stock options using a binomial-lattice model. This estimate is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex
and subjective variables, including our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors.

    We
generally determine the fair value of restricted stock units based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of the
estimated future dividends during the vesting period in which the restricted stock units holder will not participate. Certain restricted stock units granted to our employees and senior management vest
based on the achievement of pre-established performance or market conditions. For performance-based restricted stock units, each quarter we update our assessment of the probability that the specified
performance criteria will be achieved. We amortize the fair values of performance-based restricted stock units over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each
separately vesting tranche of the award. For market-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology and amortize those fair
values over the requisite service period, adjusting for estimated forfeitures for each separately vesting tranche of the award. The Monte Carlo methodology that we use to estimate the fair value of
market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Provided that the requisite service is
rendered, the total fair value of the market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant must be recognized as compensation expense even if the market condition is not achieved. However, the
number of shares that ultimately vest can vary significantly with the performance of the specified market criteria.

Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

    Below are the recently issued accounting pronouncements that were most significant to our accounting policy activities for fiscal 2017. For a
detailed discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

Inventory

    In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued new guidance related to the measurement of inventory which requires
inventory within the scope of the guidance to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of
business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We adopted this new standard as of January 1, 2017, and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

Revenue recognition

    In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP
guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific

guidance,
providing a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance is effective for us beginning with the first
quarter of 2018. We are adopting the accounting standard using the modified retrospective method, which recognizes the cumulative effect upon adoption as an adjustment to retained earnings at the
adoption date. We will report our adoption in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2018.

    The
most significant impacts of the new revenue recognition standard are expected to be:

• The accounting for our sales of our games with significant online functionality for which we do not have VSOE for unspecified
future updates and ongoing online services provided.  Under the current accounting standards, VSOE for undelivered elements is required. This
requirement will be eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software, as compared to the current
requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated service period. We expect this difference to primarily impact revenues from our Call of Duty franchise, where we expect that
approximately 20% of the sales price will be recognized as revenue upon delivery of the games to our customers. Many of our other franchises, such as Destiny, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Candy
Crush, are online hosted arrangements, and we do not expect any significant impact on the accounting for our sales of these games; and

• The accounting for certain of our software licensing arrangements.  While
the impacts of the new standard may differ on a contract-by-contract basis (the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms), we generally
expect earlier revenue recognition for these arrangements under the new revenue standard.

    We
estimate that the cumulative effect of adopting this standard will result in an adjustment to retained earnings at the adoption date of approximately $60 million to
$100 million, inclusive of the associated tax impacts. Additionally, we expect that the new disclosure requirements will require us to design and implement additional internal controls over
financial reporting, and we are in process of adjusting our processes and internal controls in preparation for adopting the new standard.

Leases

    In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the accounting for leases. The new standard will replace all current U.S. GAAP
guidance on this topic. The new standard, among other things, requires a lessee to classify a lease as either an operating or financing lease, and lessees will need to recognize a lease liability and
a right-of-use asset for their leases. The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment for initial direct costs,
lease incentives received, and any prepaid lease payments. Operating leases will result in a straight-line expense pattern, while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern.
Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and will require application of the new
guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with certain transition practical expedients available to provide relief in adopting the new standard. We are evaluating the
impact of this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. Currently, we do not plan to early adopt this new standard but we do expect to elect and apply the available transition practical
expedients upon adoption.

Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash

    In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance related to the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The new standard
requires that a statement of cash flows explain any change during the period in total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Therefore, restricted cash will be included with "Cash and cash
equivalents" when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted.

    We
are evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this new accounting guidance on our financial statements. We expect there will be a significant impact to the consolidated statements of
cash flows for 2016, as this period includes, as an investing activity, the $3.6 billion movement in restricted cash resulting from the transfer of cash into escrow at December 31, 2015,
to facilitate the King Acquisition and the subsequent release of that cash in 2016 in connection with the King Acquisition. Under this
new standard, the restricted cash balance will be included in the beginning and ending total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances and, hence, would not be included as an investing
activity in the statement of cash flows.

['S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business Overview

    Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and
distribute content and services on video game
consoles, PC, and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our games.

The King Acquisition

        On February 23, 2016, we completed the King Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 billion, as further
described in Note 20 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Our consolidated financial statements include the operations of King commencing on February 23, 2016.

Reportable Segments

    As part of the continued implementation of our esports strategy, we instituted changes to our internal organization and reporting structure such
that the MLG business now operates as a division of Blizzard. As such, commencing with the second quarter of 2017, MLG, which was previously a separate operating segment, is now a component of the
Blizzard operating segment. MLG is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other
Activision Blizzard esports content.

    Based
upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments: Activision, Blizzard, and King.

(i)    Activision

    Activision is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the console platform.
Activision primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that
distribute Activision products. Activision develops, markets, and sells products based on our internally developed intellectual properties, as well as some licensed properties.

(ii)   Blizzard

    Blizzard is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive software products and entertainment content, particularly for the PC platform. Blizzard
primarily delivers content through retail and digital channels, including subscriptions, full-game, and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that
distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming service, Blizzard Battle.net, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content, along with Activision']:

[") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit
of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the
aforementioned selling price hierarchy. Further, if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then
allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.

    As
noted above, when neither VSOE nor TPE is available for a deliverable, we use BESP. We did not have significant revenue arrangements that required using BESP for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. The inputs we use to determine the selling price of our significant deliverables include the actual price charged by the Company for deliverables that the
Company sells separately (which represents VSOE) and the wholesale prices of the same or similar products for deliverables not sold separately (which represents TPE).

Product Sales

    Product sales consists of sales of our games, including physical products and digital full-game downloads. We recognize revenues from the sale
of our products after both (1) title and risk of loss have been transferred to our customers and (2) all performance obligations have been completed. With respect to digital full-game
downloads, this is when the product is available for download or is activated for gameplay. Revenues from product sales are recognized after deducting the estimated allowance for returns and price
protection.

Product with Online Functionality or Online Hosted Arrangements

    For our software products with online functionality or that are part of an online hosted arrangement, we evaluate whether that online
functionality constitutes a more-than-inconsequential separate deliverable in addition to the software product. This evaluation is performed for each software product or product add-on (including
downloadable content), when it is released. Determining whether the online functionality for a particular product constitutes a more-than-inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires
