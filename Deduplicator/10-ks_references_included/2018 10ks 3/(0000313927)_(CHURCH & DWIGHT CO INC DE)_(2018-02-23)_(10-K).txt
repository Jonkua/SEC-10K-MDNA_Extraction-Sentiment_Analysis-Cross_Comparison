ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

OVERVIEW

Our Business

We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household and personal care and specialty products focused on animal productivity, chemicals and cleaners.  We focus our consumer products marketing efforts principally on our 11 “power brands.”  These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER, used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, cat litter, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent; TROJAN condoms, lubricants and vibrators; OXICLEAN stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergent, dishwashing detergent and bleach alternatives; SPINBRUSH battery-operated and manual toothbrushes;  FIRST RESPONSE home pregnancy and ovulation test kits; NAIR depilatories; ORAJEL oral analgesic; XTRA laundry detergent; L’IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy dietary supplements, BATISTE dry shampoos and in 2017 added WATERPIK water flossers and replacement showerheads.

We sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell the products to consumers. We sell our specialty products to industrial customers, livestock producers and through distributors.

We operate our business in three segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD.  The segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures.   In 2017, the Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD segments represented approximately 76%, 16% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.

2017 Financial Highlights

Key fiscal year 2017 financial results include:

 • 2017 net sales grew 8.1% over fiscal year 2016, with gains in all three segments, primarily due to volume growth across all segments, helped in part by the August 2017 acquisition of Waterpik and the May 2017 acquisition of Agro Biosciences in SPD.

 • Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 45.8% in fiscal year 2017 from 45.5% in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to favorable volume and lower manufacturing and commodity costs.

 • Operating margin decreased 130 basis points to 19.4% in fiscal year 2017 from 20.7% in fiscal year 2016, reflecting higher selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”), partially offset by a higher gross margin and slightly lower marketing costs.

 • We reported diluted net earnings per share in fiscal year 2017 of $2.90, an increase of approximately 66% from fiscal year 2016 diluted net earnings per share of $1.75. The current year includes a one-time favorable adjustment of $1.06 associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

 • Cash provided by operations was $681.5, a $26.2 increase from the prior year, due to higher cash earnings partially offset by higher working capital.

 • We returned $590.4 to our stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Strategic Goals, Challenges and Initiatives

Our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers’ decisions to carry our products, which are, in part, affected by general economic conditions in our markets. Although our consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, in 2017, many of the product categories in which we operate continued to experience pricing pressures, and weak or inconsistent consumer demand.  Some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings (primarily in the dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and

27

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

oral analgesics categories), and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category.  In addition, an increasing portion of our product categories is being sold by club stores, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers.  These factors have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins.

We expect a competitive marketplace in 2018 due to new product introductions by competitors and continuing aggressive competitive pricing pressures.  In this environment, we intend to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives: maintain competitive marketing and trade spending, tightly control our cost structure, continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursue strategic acquisitions.  We also intend to continue to grow our product sales globally and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers.

There continues to be significant product and price competition in the premium and deep value laundry detergent categories and more recently, product competition in the gummy vitamin category.   For example, in the laundry detergent category, P&G and Henkel, the two largest laundry detergent companies in the U.S., are engaged in aggressive pricing promotions, and retailers are continuing to de-emphasize the deep value tier of laundry detergents, which is where XTRA competes.  In addition, the gummy vitamin category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years.  We continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending. However, there is no assurance the categories will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline.

We are continuously focused on strengthening our key brands, such as ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, TROJAN, L’IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION, BATISTE and WATERPIK, through the launch of innovative new products, which span various product categories, including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending.  There can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.

In 2017, we were able to grow market share in seven of 11 of our “power brands” in measured channels.  Our global product portfolio consists of both premium (60% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2017) and value (40% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2017) brands, which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments.  We intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among cost-conscious consumers.

Over the past 17 years, we have diversified from an almost exclusively U.S. business to a global company with approximately 17% of sales derived from foreign countries in 2017.  We have operations in six countries (Canada, Mexico, U.K., France, Australia, and Brazil), recently established a subsidiary in Germany and export to over 130 other countries.  In 2017, we benefited from our expanded global footprint; however, we have focused and will continue to focus on selectively expanding our global business.  Net sales generated outside of the U.S. are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results.

We also continue to focus on controlling our costs.  Historically, we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and, to a lesser extent, by passing along some of these cost increases to customers.  We have also entered into set pricing and pre-buying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel.  Additionally, maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of ours and has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions.

The identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy.  Acquisitions have added significantly to our sales and profits over the last decade.  This is recently evidenced by our 2015 acquisition of certain assets of Varied Industries Corporation (the “VI-COR Acquisition”), 2016 acquisitions of Spencer Forrest, Inc., the maker of TOPPIK (the “TOPPIK Acquisition”), and the ANUSOL and RECTINOL businesses from Johnson & Johnson (the “ANUSOL Acquisition”) and 2017 acquisitions of VIVISCAL from Lifes2Good Holdings Limited (the “Viviscal Acquisition”), Agro BioSciences, Inc. (the “Agro Acquisition”), and WATERPIK from Pik Holdings, Inc. (the “Waterpik Acquisition”).   However, the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset write-downs.  We actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines, and our strong financial position provides us with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.  In addition, our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions.  Since 2001, we have acquired 10 of our 11 “power brands”.

We believe we are positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives: maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending, managing our cost structure, continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursuing strategic acquisitions.  This focus, together with the strength of our portfolio of premium and value brands, has enabled us to succeed in a range of economic environments, and is expected to position us to continue to increase stockholder value over the long-term.  Moreover, the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations, as a result of net income and effective working capital management,

28

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

combined with an investment grade credit rating provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions, drive new product development, make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements, return cash to stockholders through dividends and  share buy backs, and reduce outstanding debt, positioning us to continue to create stockholder value.

For information regarding risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.

Recent Developments

U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act significantly changes the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates to 21%. However, the Tax Act eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves toward a territorial system, which also eliminates the ability to credit certain foreign taxes that existed prior to enactment of the Tax Act. There are also certain transitional impacts of the Tax Act. As part of the transition to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Act imposes a one-time repatriation tax on a deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We intend to repatriate some of our non-U.S. earnings and pay the associated repatriation tax.  In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate caused us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21%. These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net credit of approximately $273 for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The credit is primarily due to the adjustment to the U.S. deferred tax asset and liabilities.

The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final transitional impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act, or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transitional impacts. The Commission has issued guidance that allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. We currently anticipate finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of the measurement period.

Accelerated Share Repurchase Program

In December of 2017, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) contract with a commercial bank to purchase $200 million of the Common Stock.  On January 4, 2018, we paid $200 million to the bank and received a total of 4.1 million shares during the first quarter of 2018.  We used cash on hand plus borrowing to fund the initial purchase price.

Share Repurchase Program

On November 1, 2017, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $500.0 in shares of Common Stock (the “2017 Share Repurchase Program”).  The 2017 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration and replaced the 2016 Share Repurchase Program.   We will continue our evergreen share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase, from time to time, Common Stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of Common Stock under our incentive plans.  As a result of the $100 million purchased in the fourth quarter of 2017, there remains $400 million under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2017.

Water Pik, Inc. Acquisition

On August 7, 2017, we acquired Pik Holdings, Inc. (“Waterpik”), a water-jet technology company that designs and sells both oral water flossers and replacement shower heads (the “Waterpik Acquisition”).  The total purchase price was $1,024.6 (net of cash acquired), which was subject to a working capital adjustment.  Waterpik’s annual sales were approximately $265.0 for the trailing twelve months through June 30, 2017.  We financed the Waterpik Acquisition with proceeds from our underwritten public offering of $1,425.0 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes (as defined below) completed on July 25, 2017.  Subsequent to the Waterpik Acquisition, Waterpik is managed by the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments.

Agro BioSciences, Inc. Acquisition

On May 1, 2017, we acquired Agro BioSciences, Inc. (the “Agro Acquisition”), an innovator and leader in developing custom probiotic products for poultry, cattle and swine.  The total purchase price was approximately $75.0, which was subject to a working capital adjustment, and an additional payment of up to $25.0 after three years based on sales performance. Agro BioSciences, Inc.’s annual sales were approximately $11.0 in 2016.  The acquisition was funded with short-term borrowings and is managed by the Specialty Products Division (“SPD”) segment.

Viviscal Acquisition

On January 17, 2017, we acquired the VIVISCAL business from Lifes2Good Holdings Limited for approximately $160.  Viviscal is the number one hair care supplement brand both in the U.S. and the U.K. with global annual sales of $44 in 2016.  This brand is complementary to our global BATISTE dry shampoo and TOPPIK hair care business. The acquisition was funded with short-term borrowings and is managed in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments.

Dividend Increase

On February 5, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a 14% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.19 to $0.2175 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $0.87 per share payable to stockholders of record as of February 15, 2018.  The increase raises the annual dividend payout from $190 to approximately $215.

International Pension Plan Termination

In 2016, we authorized the termination of an international defined benefit pension plan under which approximately 336 participants, including 53 active employees, had accrued benefits.  We completed the termination of this plan in the second quarter of 2017.  In addition to plan assets, we made a one-time payment of $7.5 to purchase annuities for participants.  We recorded a one-time SG&A expense of $39.2 ($31.5 after tax) in the Consumer International segment in the second quarter of 2017.  This expense primarily included the effect of the additional cash payment required at settlement and pension settlement accounting rules which require accelerated recognition of actuarial losses that were to be amortized over the expected benefit lives of participants.  As of June 30, 2017, we had no further obligations with respect to material defined benefit pension plans.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP).  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty.  They are based on our historical experience, our observation of trends in industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.  Our significant accounting policies and estimates are described below.

Revenue Recognition and Promotional and Sales Return Reserves

Virtually all of our revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by our customers.  The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.  Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers).  All such costs are netted against sales.  Slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer.  Cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for our products.  Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place.  Costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold.  We rely on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves.  For example, we use historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements.  Based on the total face value of Consumer Domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, an approximately $3.4 difference in the reserve required for coupons would result.  With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, we use experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required.  If our estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $7.8.  While management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we reduced promotion liabilities by approximately $0.6, $5.4 and $4.3, respectively, based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information.  These adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by us.

Impairment of goodwill, trade names and other intangible assets

Carrying values of goodwill, trade names and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment.  For finite intangible assets, we assess business triggering events.  Our impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate.  Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions.  With respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit.  For trade names and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset.  Judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations.  Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired.  The result of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units.  In addition, there were no goodwill impairment charges for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017.

Fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method, which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could impact fair values in the future.  We determined that the fair value of all other intangible assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability. There is a personal care trade name that, based on recent performance, has experienced sales and profit declines that have eroded a significant portion of the excess between fair and carrying value which could potentially result in an impairment of the asset. In 2017, this excess has been reduced to approximately $34.0 or 12% due in large part to an increased competitive market environment therefore resulting in reduced cash flow projections. As a result, this indefinite-lived intangible asset is more susceptible to impairment risk. While management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk, significant changes in operating plans or adverse

31

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of this asset.

 It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) the businesses or brands do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2018 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA.  A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Inventory valuation

When appropriate, we write down the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value, which reflects any costs to sell or dispose).  We identify any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value.  The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for our products, technological changes, and new product introductions.  In addition, our allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units (SKUs).  We evaluate our inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and record adjustments as required.  Adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were $12.8 at December 31, 2017, $10.5 at December 31, 2016, and $12.6 at December 31, 2015.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized.  We record liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under U.S. GAAP guidelines.  The liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by us, may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement.  We adjust this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations.  Many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change.  In this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate.  Conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, 2016 AND 2015

The discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment.  The discussion of our consolidated results of operations and segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.  The segment discussion also addresses certain product line information.  Our operating units are consistent with our reportable segments.

Consolidated results

2017 compared to 2016

 Twelve Months Ended Change vs. Twelve Months Ended
------------------------------------------ ------------------- ------- - ---------- ----------------- ------------------- - ------- -
 December 31, 2017 Prior Year December 31, 2016
Net Sales $ 3,776.2 8.1% $ 3,493.1

Operating Margin 19.4 % -130 basis points 20.7 %
Net income per share - Diluted $ 2.90 65.7% $ 1.75

Net Sales

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $3,776.2, an increase of $283.1, or 8.1% compared to 2016 net sales.  The components of the net sales increase are as follows:

Net Sales - Consolidated December 31, 2017
------------------------------------------ ----------------- ---- --
Product volumes sold 5.0 %
Pricing/Product mix (2.3 %)
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations / Other (— %)
Volume from acquired product lines (1) 5.4 %
Net Sales increase 8.1 %

 (1) On January 17, 2017, we acquired the Viviscal business (the “Viviscal Acquisition”), on May 1, 2017, we acquired Agro BioSciences, Inc. (the “Agro Acquisition”) and on August 7, 2017, we acquired Waterpik (the “Waterpik Acquisition”). Net sales of these acquisitions are included in our results since the date of acquisition. In March 2017, we sold our chemical business in Brazil.

All three segments reported volume increases. Both Consumer Domestic and Consumer International experienced unfavorable price/mix.

Our gross profit for 2017 was $1,729.6, a $139.0 increase compared to 2016.  Gross margin was 45.8% in 2017 compared to 45.5% in 2016, a 30 basis points (“bps”) increase.  The increase is due to the impact of higher margins on acquired businesses representing 80 bps, favorable volume of 70 bps, and lower manufacturing costs of 40 bps, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of 140 bps (primarily due to higher promotion and coupon costs), higher commodity costs of 30 bps, and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates of 10 bps.  Gross margin in 2016 included a plant impairment charge of 20 bps at an international subsidiary.

Operating Costs

Marketing expenses for 2017 were $454.2, an increase of $27.0 compared to 2016.  Acquired businesses contributed modestly to the increase.  Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 bps to 12.0% in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to 90 bps of leverage on higher net sales partially offset by 70 bps on higher expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) expenses for 2017 were $542.7, an increase of $103.5 or 23.6% compared to 2016.  The increase is primarily due to the $39.2 international pension settlement charge, transition and ongoing

33

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

acquisition-related costs, higher information system and legal costs and costs associated with selling the chemical business in Brazil.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 180 bps to 14.4% in 2017 compared to 12.6% in 2016.  The increase is due to higher costs of 280 bps, partially offset by 100 bps of leverage associated with higher sales. The pension charge contributed 110 bps to the increase.

Other Income and Expenses

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased by $1.6 in 2017 as compared to 2016.  The increase in earnings during 2017 was due primarily to profit improvement from Armand Products due to lower raw material costs.

Interest expense in 2017 was $52.6, an increase of $24.9 compared to 2016 due to a higher amount of average debt outstanding associated with the $1,425.0 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes completed on July 25, 2017.

Taxation

The 2017 tax rate was -7.3% compared to 35.0% in 2016.  The 2017 tax rate was positively impacted by 39.4% as a result of the Tax Act and 2.2% related to the adoption of the new accounting standard which modifies how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees.  Previously, this tax benefit related to the adoption of the new accounting standard was accounted for in our Stockholders’ Equity section of the Balance Sheet.  Starting in 2017, the tax benefit has been accounted for as a reduction of income tax expense.

The new tax law is expected to reduce our future tax burden by lowering the effective tax rate to approximately 24-25%.  This estimate is based on our current understanding of the new Tax Act which may change as regulations are finalized.

2016 compared to 2015

Net Sales

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3,493.1, an increase of $98.3, or approximately 2.9% compared to 2015 net sales.  The components of the net sales increase are as follows:

Net Sales - Consolidated December 31, 2016
------------------------------------------ ----------------- ---- --
Product volumes sold 3.1 %
Pricing/Product mix 0.1 %
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations / Other (0.9 %)
Volume from acquired product lines (1) 0.6 %
Net Sales increase 2.9 %

 (1) On January 4, 2016, we completed the Toppik Acquisition, acquiring Spencer Forrest, Inc., the maker of TOPPIK, the leading brand of hair building fibers for people with thinning hair. Net sales of this acquisition are included in our results since the date of acquisition.

Volume growth in Consumer Domestic and Consumer International was partially offset by lower SPD volume.

Our gross profit for 2016 was $1,590.6, a $78.8 increase compared to 2015. Gross margin was 45.5% in 2016 compared to 44.5% in 2015, a 100 basis points (“bps”) increase.  The increase is due to lower manufacturing costs of 70 bps (including productivity programs and the absence of start-up costs incurred in 2015 associated with our new vitamin manufacturing facility), lower commodity costs of 60 bps, and the impact of the higher margin acquired business of 30 bps, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates of 30 bps, a plant impairment charge of 20 bps at an international subsidiary and unfavorable price/volume mix of 10 bps.

Operating Costs

Marketing expenses for 2016 were $427.2, an increase of $9.7 compared to 2015.  Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 bps to 12.2% in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to 40 bps of leverage on higher net sales partially offset by 30 bps on higher expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) expenses for 2016 were $439.2, an increase of $19.1 or 4.5% compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to costs associated with the Toppik Acquisition and higher compensation costs, partially offset

34

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

by a pension plan charge recorded in 2015.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 30 bps to 12.6% in 2016 compared to 12.3% in 2015.  The increase is due to higher costs of 60 bps, partially offset by 30 bps of leverage associated with higher sales.

Other Income and Expenses

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased by $15.0 in 2016 as compared to 2015.  The increase in earnings during 2016 was due primarily to a $17.0 impairment charge in 2015 associated with our remaining investment in Natronx.

Interest expense in 2016 was $27.7, a decrease of $2.8 compared to 2015 due to a lower amount of average debt outstanding.

Taxation

The 2016 tax rate was 35.0% compared to 35.4% in 2015.  The 2015 tax rate was negatively impacted by a valuation allowance recorded in connection with the Natronx impairment charge.

Segment results for 2017, 2016 and 2015

We operate three reportable segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD.  These segments are determined based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures.  We also have a Corporate segment.

Segment Products
---------------------- ------------------------------------
Consumer Domestic Household and personal care products
Consumer International Primarily personal care products
SPD Specialty chemical products

The Corporate segment income consists of equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates.  As of December 31, 2017, we held 50% ownership interests in each of Armand and ArmaKleen, respectively, and a one-third ownership interest in Natronx.  Our equity in earnings (losses) of Armand and ArmaKleen for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and Armand, ArmaKleen and Natronx for the years ended December 31, 2015 are included in the Corporate segment.

Some of the subsidiaries that are included in the Consumer International segment manufacture and sell personal care products to the Consumer Domestic segment.  These sales are eliminated from the Consumer International segment results set forth below.

Segment net sales and income before income taxes for each of the three years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

Consumer Domestic

2017 compared to 2016

Consumer Domestic net sales in 2017 were $2,854.9, an increase of $177.1 or 6.6% compared to net sales of $2,677.8 in 2016.  The components of the net sales change are the following:

Net Sales - Consumer Domestic December 31, 2017
-------------------------------------- ----------------- ---- --
Product volumes sold 4.6 %
Pricing/Product mix (3.2 %)
Volume from acquired product lines (1) 5.2 %
Net Sales increase 6.6 %

 (1) Includes net sales of the brands acquired in the Viviscal Acquisition and the Waterpik Acquisition since the date of acquisition.

The increase in net sales for 2017, reflects the impact of acquisitions, higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose detergents, BATISTE dry shampoo, OXICLEAN stain fighters and ARM & HAMMER cat litter, partially offset by lower sales of TROJAN condoms, XTRA laundry detergent and gummy vitamins.

There continues to be significant product and price competition in the premium and deep value laundry detergent categories and more recently, product competition in the gummy vitamin category.   For example, in the laundry detergent category, P&G and Henkel, the two largest laundry detergent companies in the U.S., are engaged in aggressive pricing promotions, and retailers are continuing to de-emphasize the deep value tier of laundry detergents, which is where XTRA competes.  In addition, the gummy vitamin category has grown from eight competitors to 30 in the last five years.  We continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending.  However, there is no assurance the categories will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline.

Consumer Domestic income before income taxes for 2017 was $606.4, a $15.8 increase as compared to 2016.  The increase is due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes of $146.5, favorable commodity and manufacturing costs of $15.1, partially offset by unfavorable price/mix of $90.5, higher marketing expenses of $18.9, higher interest expense of $20.7, and higher SG&A costs of $15.8.

2016 compared to 2015

Consumer Domestic net sales in 2016 were $2,677.8, an increase of $96.2 or 3.7% compared to net sales of $2,581.6 in 2015.  The components of the net sales change are the following:

Net Sales - Consumer Domestic December 31, 2016
-------------------------------------- ----------------- ---- --
Product volumes sold 3.4 %
Pricing/Product mix (0.3 %)
Volume from acquired product lines (1) 0.6 %
Net Sales increase 3.7 %

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

 (1) Includes net sales of the brands acquired in the Toppik Acquisition since the date of acquisition.

The increase in net sales for 2016, reflects higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid and unit dose detergents, VITAFUSION gummy vitamins, OXICLEAN laundry additive ARM & HAMMER Cat Litter products and BATISTE dry shampoo, partially offset by lower sales of XTRA laundry detergent and L’IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins.

There continues to be significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category. For example, P&G markets a lower-priced line of laundry detergents, Simply Tide, which competes directly with our core value laundry detergents. P&G has significantly increased its discounting of Simply Tide which could have a broad negative impact on the laundry category pricing and profitability.  In addition, in 2016, Henkel entered the U.S. market with Persil, its leading worldwide premium laundry detergent, and on September 1, 2016 completed its acquisition of Sun Products, the maker of All, Wisk, Sun, and private label laundry detergents.  While it is too early to assess what impact this will have on our laundry detergent business, the introduction of Persil and Henkel’s increased scale and market share could precipitate greater price competition in the category and distribution pressure with a potential adverse impact on our laundry detergent business.  Moreover, the unit dose laundry detergent segment is the fastest growing segment in the laundry detergent category, having grown to approximately 16% of the category since the introduction of this form in 2012, and we face pressure to achieve our proportionate share of the segment with a potential adverse impact on our share of the laundry detergent category.  We continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending.  Additionally, while the category grew 3.3% for the 52 weeks ended December 17, 2016 and 1.6% for the 52 weeks ended December 19, 2015, after experiencing declines in 2013 and 2014, there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline.

Consumer Domestic income before income taxes for 2016 was $590.6, a $61.2 increase as compared to 2015.  The increase is due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes of $70.1, favorable commodity and manufacturing costs of $40.3, partially offset by higher SG&A costs of $24.7, unfavorable price/mix of $17.2, and higher marketing expenses of $8.7.

Consumer International

2017 compared to 2016

Consumer International net sales in 2017 were $621.1, an increase of $95.9 or 18.3% as compared to 2016.  The components of the net sales change are the following:

Net Sales - Consumer International December 31, 2017
-------------------------------------- ----------------- ---- --
Product volumes sold 8.1 %
Pricing/Product mix (0.3 %)
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 0.1 %
Volume from acquired product lines (1) 10.4 %
Net Sales increase 18.3 %

 (1) Includes net sales of the brands acquired in the Anusol Acquisition, the Viviscal Acquisition and the Waterpik Acquisition since the date of acquisition.

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, higher sales for the year occurred in exports, Canada, Australia, Europe and Mexico. The addition of the acquired business contributed significantly to the sales growth.  Of the existing brands, BATISTE, STERIMAR, FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and ARM & HAMMER cat litter brands had strong sales growth.

Consumer International income before income taxes was $32.0 in 2017, a decrease of $34.3 compared to 2016 due primarily to the pension settlement charge of $39.2, higher other SG&A costs of $29.7, higher marketing costs of $7.4, unfavorable manufacturing and commodity costs of $6.9, unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $4.0, and unfavorable price/mix of $2.3, partially offset by higher sales volumes of $57.9.

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

Consumer International net sales in 2016 were $525.2, an increase of $24.2 or 4.8% as compared to 2015.  The components of the net sales change are the following:

Net Sales - Consumer International December 31, 2016
-------------------------------------- ----------------- ---- --
Product volumes sold 7.3 %
Pricing/Product mix 2.7 %
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (6.0 %)
Volume from acquired product lines (1) 0.8 %
Net Sales increase 4.8 %

 (1) Includes net sales of the brands acquired in the Toppik Acquisition since the date of acquisition.

Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, higher sales for the year occurred in exports, Canada, Mexico, and Europe.  The BATISTE, ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, FEMFRESH, STERIMAR, and TROJAN brands had strong sales growth.

Consumer International income before income taxes was $66.3 in 2016, an increase of $11.8 compared to 2015 due primarily to higher volumes of $23.4, favorable price/mix of $7.5 and lower SG&A of $1.4, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $12.2, higher marketing costs of $6.2, and higher manufacturing costs of $2.3.  Last year’s results included an $8.9 pension settlement charge.

Specialty Products

2017 compared to 2016

SPD net sales were $300.2 for 2017, an increase of $10.1, or 3.5% compared to 2016.  The components of the net sales change are the following:

Net Sales - SPD December 31, 2017
----------------------------------------------------------- ----------------- ---- --
Product volumes sold 2.6 %
Pricing/Product mix 2.7 %
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 0.4 %
Volume from acquired product lines (net of divestiture) (1) (2.2 %)
Net Sales increase 3.5 %

(1) Includes net sales of the Agro Acquisition since the date of acquisition and is negatively impacted by the sale of the Brazilian chemical business.

Excluding the impact of the acquisition and divestiture, the net sales increase in 2017 was driven primarily by improved price and volumes in the animal productivity business where U.S. dairy farm profitability throughout 2017 was higher than the prior year.

SPD income before income taxes was $43.5 in 2017, an increase of $3.7 compared to 2016.  The increase in income before income taxes for 2017 is due primarily to higher sales volume of $13.0, favorable price/product mix of $7.0, lower costs associated with selling the Brazilian chemical business of $4.9, and lower costs associated with the Natronx joint venture of $1.7, partially offset by higher SG&A costs of $14.0 and higher manufacturing costs of $7.4.

2016 compared to 2015

SPD net sales were $290.1 for 2016, a decrease of $22.1, or 7.1% compared to 2015.  The components of the net sales change are the following:

Net Sales - SPD December 31, 2016
---------------------------------- ----------------- ---- --
Product volumes sold (6.5 %)
Pricing/Product mix (0.1 %)
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (0.5 %)
Net Sales increase (7.1 %)

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

The net sales decrease in 2016 reflects lower sales in the animal productivity business driven primarily by continued low milk prices and a strong year ago results comparison.  The low milk prices are principally due to an excess global supply of milk and weak exports due to a strong U.S. dollar.

SPD income before income taxes was $39.8 in 2016, a decrease of $17.5 compared to 2015.  The decrease in income before income taxes for 2016 is due primarily to lower sales volume of $8.7, a plant impairment charge of $4.9, higher manufacturing costs of $4.1, and higher SG&A of $2.8 partially offset by lower other expense of $2.3 mainly as a result of foreign exchange rate changes.

Corporate

The Corporate segment reflects the reclassification of administrative costs of the production, planning and logistics functions which are included in SG&A expenses in the operating segments but are elements of cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Such amounts were $32.8, $36.6 and $32.6 for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Also included in corporate segment are the equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates from Armand and ArmaKleen in 2017 and 2016 and Armand, ArmaKleen and Natronx in 2015.  The increase in equity in earnings of affiliates in 2016 is primarily due to the $17.0 Natronx impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2015.

Liquidity and capital resources

On December 4, 2015, we replaced our former $600.0 unsecured revolving credit facility with a $1,000.0 unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”).  Under the Credit Agreement, we have the ability to increase our borrowing up to an additional $600.0, subject to lender commitments and certain conditions as described in the Credit Agreement.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes and are used to support our $1,000.0 commercial paper program (the “Program”), which was increased from $500.0 on February 23, 2017.  Unless extended, the Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts outstanding thereunder will be due and payable on December 4, 2020.

As of December 31, 2017, we had $278.9 in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $728 available through the revolving facility under our Credit Agreement and our commercial paper program, and a commitment increase feature under the Credit Agreement that enables us to borrow up to an additional $600.0, subject to lending commitments of the participating lenders and certain conditions as described in the Credit Agreement.  To preserve our liquidity, we invest our cash primarily in government money market funds and short term bank deposits.

During 2015, we liquidated our subsidiary in the Netherlands and decided that the earnings of our subsidiary in France would no longer be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S.  As a result, we repatriated cash of $93.0.  The funds repatriated were used to reduce outstanding commercial paper.  As a result of liquidating our subsidiary in the Netherlands, we recorded a tax benefit of $2.7 in the Consolidated Statement of Income and a deferred tax benefit of $11.6 through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the second quarter of 2015.

As a result of tax reform, we have decided to repatriate excess cash held at our foreign subsidiaries in 2018. We estimate we will repatriate approximately $150 of the $194 held outside the U.S.

We financed the Waterpik Acquisition with a portion of the proceeds from an underwritten public offering of $1,425.0 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes completed on July 25, 2017, consisting of $300.0 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2019, $300.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2022, $425.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.15% Senior Notes due 2027 and $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due 2047 (collectively, the “Senior Notes”).  The Floating Rate Senior Notes will bear interest at a rate, reset quarterly, equal to three-month U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 0.15%.  The remaining proceeds of the offering of the Senior Notes were used to pay down in its entirety and terminate our $200.0 term loan borrowed in the second quarter of 2017 and to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings.

On December 9, 2014, we issued $300.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due December 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”).  The 2019 Notes were issued under the first supplemental indenture (the “First Supplemental Indenture”), dated December 9, 2014, to the indenture dated December 9, 2014 (the “Base Indenture”), between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.  The 2019 Notes will mature on December 15, 2019, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the First Supplemental Indenture.

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

On September 26, 2012, we issued $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”).  The 2022 Notes were issued under the second supplemental indenture, dated September 26, 2012 (the “BNY Mellon Second Supplemental Indenture”) to the indenture dated December 15, 2010 (the “BNY Mellon Base Indenture”) between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee.  The 2022 Notes will mature on October 1, 2022, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the BNY Mellon Second Supplemental Indenture.

The current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for our liquidity.  (See “Unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products” under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.)  We do not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenant in the Credit Agreement because we currently are, and anticipate that we will continue to be, in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio requirement under the Credit Agreement.

On February 5, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a 14% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.19 to $0.2175 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $0.87 per share payable to stockholders of record as of February 15, 2018.  The increase raises the annual dividend payout from $190 to approximately $215.  On November 1, 2017, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program, under which we may repurchase up to $500.0 in shares of Common Stock (the “2017 Share Repurchase Program”).  The 2017 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration and replaced the 2016 Share Repurchase Program.  We also continued our evergreen share repurchase program, authorized by the Board on January 29, 2014, under which we may repurchase, from time to time, Common Stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of Common Stock under our incentive plans.

In 2017, we purchased approximately 8.2 million shares of Common Stock for $400.0, of which $125.0 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program, $100.0 was purchased under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program, and $175.0 was purchased under the 2016 Share Repurchase Program.  As a result of our purchases, there remained $400.0 under the 2017 Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2017.

In December of 2017, we entered an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) contract with a commercial bank to purchase $200 million of the Common Stock.  On January 4, 2018, we paid $200 million to the bank and received a total of 4.1 million shares during the first quarter of 2018.  We used cash on hand plus borrowing to fund the initial purchase price.

We anticipate that our cash from operations, together with our current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $70.0 in 2018, fund our share repurchase programs to the extent implemented by management and pay dividends at the latest approved rate.  Cash, together with our current borrowing capacity, may be used for acquisitions that would complement our existing product lines or geographic markets.  We do not have any mandatory fixed rate debt principal payments in 2018.

Cash Flow Analysis

 Year Ended
--------------------------------------------------- ------------ -------- - ------------ - ------ ------------ - ------ -
 December 31, December 31, December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 681.5 $ 655.3 $ 606.1
Net cash used in investing activities $ (1,303.4 ) $ (354.6 ) $ (141.2 )
Net cash provided by (used) in financing activities $ 698.9 $ (439.6 ) $ (535.0 )

2017 compared to 2016

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities – Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital.  Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 increased by $26.2 to $681.5 as compared to $655.3 in 2016 due to higher cash earnings (net income plus non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, non-cash compensation and asset impairment charges) partially offset by slightly higher working capital.  The change in working capital is primarily due to, an increase in inventories and a smaller increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.  We measure working capital effectiveness based on our cash conversion cycle.  The following table presents our cash conversion cycle information for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

40

CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC AND SUBSIDIARIES

(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)

 As of
-------------------------------------------------------- ----------------- -- ----------------- -- ------ -- -
 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change
Days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") 31 30 1
Days of inventory outstanding ("DIO") 52 51 1
Days of accounts payable outstanding ("DPO") 65 60 (5 )
Cash conversion cycle 18 21 (3 )

Our cash conversion cycle (defined as the sum of DSO and DIO less DPO) which is calculated using a two period average method, improved three days from the prior year amount of 21 days to 18 days at December 31, 2017 due primarily to improved DPO of five days from 60 to 65 days, as we continue to extend payment terms with our suppliers, partially offset by DSO which increased one day from 30 to 31 days and DIO which increased one day from 51 to 52.  The improvement in our cash conversion cycle reflects our continued focus on reducing our average working capital requirements.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities – Net cash used in investing activities during 2017 was $1,303.4, principally reflecting $1,260.0 for acquisitions and $45.0 for property, plant and equipment expenditures.

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities – Net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was $698.9, primarily reflecting $1,621.3 of long-term debt borrowings and $42.1 of proceeds from stock option exercises partially offset by $400.0 of repurchases of our Common Stock, $200.0 of long-term debt repayments, $190.4 of cash dividend payments, $151.3 of net commercial paper repayments, $17.8 of financing costs and $4.5 of short-term debt repayments at an international subsidiary.

2016 compared to 2015

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities – Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital.  Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 increased by $49.2 to $655.3 as compared to $606.1 in 2015 due to a reduction in working capital and higher cash earnings (net income plus non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, non-cash compensation and asset impairment charges).  The change in working capital is primarily due to higher accounts receivable, including the impact of factoring an additional $22.3 to a bank, a decrease in inventories and higher accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities – Net cash used in investing activities during 2016 was $354.6, principally reflecting $305.3 for acquisitions and $49.8 for property, plant and equipment expenditures.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities – Net cash used in financing activities during 2016 was $439.6, primarily reflecting $400.0 of repurchases of our Common Stock and $183.0 of cash dividend payments, partially offset by $80.5 of proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises, and $65.5 of additional commercial paper borrowings, and an additional $3.4 of short term borrowings at an international subsidiary.
