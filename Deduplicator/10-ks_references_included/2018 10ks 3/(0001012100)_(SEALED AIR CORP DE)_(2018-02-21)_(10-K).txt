Item 7.        Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The information in this MD&A should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8, as well as the discussion included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions, except per share amounts.

On March 25, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Diversey Care division and the Food Hygiene and Cleaning business within the Food Care division (collectively "Diversey"). The sale of Diversey was completed on September 6, 2017. The net assets of Diversey met the criteria to be classified as “held for sale” for the period ended December 31, 2016. Results of operations for Diversey are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Note 3, “Discontinued Operations, Divestitures and Acquisitions” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The Company’s segment reporting structure now consists of two reportable segments and a Corporate category as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Food Care (including Medical Applications and New Ventures businesses); and

- -------------
• Product Care.

The Company’s Food Care and Product Care segments are considered reportable segments under FASB ASC Topic 280. Our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products and management team. Corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable segments, primarily consisting of unallocated corporate overhead costs, including administrative functions and cost recovery variances not allocated to the reportable segments from global functional expenses.
See Note 4, “Segments” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Overview
We are a global leader in food safety and security and product protection. We serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing, food service, retail, healthcare and industrial, and commercial and consumer applications. Our focus is on achieving quality sales growth through leveraging our geographic footprint, technological know-how and leading market positions to bring measurable, sustainable value to our customers, employees and investors. We have widely recognized and inventive brands such as Cryovac® packaging technology, and our Bubble Wrap® brand cushioning, Jiffy® protective mailers, and Instapak® foam-in-place systems.
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 2,300 sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors, fabricators, converters, e-commerce and mail order fulfillment firms, and contract packaging firms as well as directly to end-users such as food processors, food service businesses, supermarket retailers, lodging, retail pharmaceutical companies, healthcare facilities, medical device manufacturers, and other manufacturers. We have no material long-term contracts for the distribution of our products. In 2017, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales.
Historically, net sales in our Food Care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, due to holiday events. Net sales in our Product Care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the mid-third quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season. On a consolidated basis, there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter. Our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality. Cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the second half of the year, reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes, including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments.
Other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including, but not limited to, changes in raw materials and other costs, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other non-recurring charges.
Competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology, we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership. Competition is both global and regional in scope and

29

includes numerous small, local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach. For more details, see “Competition” included in Part I, Item 1 “Business.”
Our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. Our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs, including petrochemical-related costs (primarily resin costs), which are not within our control. Consequently, our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemical-based and other raw materials as efficiently as possible. We also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions.
We manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow. We believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions. Moreover, we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders.
Recent Events and Trends

On October 2, 2017, the Product Care Division acquired Fagerdala Singapore Pte Ltd., a manufacturer and fabricator of polyethylene foam for approximately $100 million in cash. Refer to Note 3, “Discontinued Operations, Divestitures and Acquisitions,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition.

On December 22, 2017, U.S. federal legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA"), was signed into law, significantly reforming tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. The TCJA, among other things, reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creates a territorial tax system with a one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries, and creates new taxes on certain foreign earnings. Refer to Note 16, “Income Taxes” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the TCJA.

The Company was a party in an anti-trust class-action litigation settlement that approved a distribution to the Company of net proceeds of approximately $13 to $15 million, with the majority expected to be received in early 2018, and any remaining balance upon subsequent Court order.

Foreign Currency Translation Impact on Consolidated Financial Results
Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency-denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact. Historically, the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro, the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Venezuelan bolivar.
The following table presents the approximate favorable or (unfavorable) impact foreign currency translation had on some of our consolidated financial results:

-------------------------------------------- ------------- ---- ------------- ----- - ------ -

(In millions) 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
Net sales $ 29.9 $ (124.9 )
Cost of sales (22.5 ) 85.6
Selling, general and administrative expenses (4.9 ) 20.8
Net earnings (0.9 ) 17.0
Adjusted EBITDA 4.9 (39.1 )

Net Sales by Geographic Region

The following tables present the components of the change in net sales by geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015. We also present the change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, which we define as “constant dollar.” We believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability between periods as it eliminates the volatility of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Food Care
2017 compared with 2016
As reported, net sales increased $128 million, or 5%, in 2017 compared with 2016, of which $27 million was due to positive currency impact. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $102 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of $117 million, reflecting an increase in North America on strong demand of protein packaging and more modest increases in EMEA and Latin America.

This was partially offset by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower unit volumes in APAC of $14 million primarily due to the continuation of historically low slaughter rates in Australia; and

- ------------------------------------
• unfavorable price/mix of $1 million.

2016 compared with 2015
As reported, net sales decreased $169 million, or 6%, in 2016 compared with 2015, of which $103 million was due to negative currency impact. On a constant dollar basis, net sales decreased $67 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the divestiture of our North American foam trays and absorbent pads and European food trays businesses of $102 million; and

35

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower unit volumes of $39 million, reflecting continued economic uncertainty and social and political instability in Latin America, and lower demand in Asia Pacific driven by historically low slaughter rates in Australia.

These were partially offset by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of $64 million, in North America and EMEA combined with strong demand within our core product portfolio, adoption of new products and increased market penetration of advanced packaging solutions; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• favorable price/mix of $9 million reflecting an increase in Latin America and EMEA, primarily due to pricing initiatives implemented to offset currency devaluation, a favorable mix of new higher margin products and the implementation of value-added pricing initiatives and non-material inflationary costs, which was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix in North America primarily attributable to the timing of formula pricing adjustments at key customers.

Product Care
2017 compared with 2016
As reported, net sales increased $122 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared with 2016, of which $3 million was due to positive currency impact. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $119 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• incremental sales resulting from the acquisition of Fagerdala in Singapore of $24 million;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of $86 million across all regions, primarily in North America due to ongoing strength in the e-Commerce and third party logistics markets as well as increased volume units in APAC; and

- ----------------------------------
• favorable price/mix of $9 million.

2016 compared with 2015
As reported, net sales decreased $30 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared with 2015, of which $22 million was due to negative currency impact. On a constant dollar basis, net sales decreased $7 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the following:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower unit volumes of $39 million primarily due to rationalization and weakness in the industrial sector, as well as declines in Latin America due to the political and economic environment; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• unfavorable price/mix of $29 million primarily in North America driven by targeted pricing incentives and an unfavorable product mix related to accelerated growth in e-Commerce and a shift in demand due to more innovative, resource-efficient solutions.

This was partially offset by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of $64 million, primarily in North America and EMEA due to ongoing strength in the e-Commerce and third party logistics markets.

Cost of sales for three years ended December 31, were as follows:

------------------- ----------------------- ------- ------------- ------- ------------- ------- -------- - -------- ------- - ---- -- ---- --

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
(In millions) 2017 2016 2015 % Change % Change
Net sales $ 4,461.6 $ 4,211.3 $ 4,410.3 5.9 % (4.5 )%
Cost of sales 3,044.4 2,806.4 2,955.1 8.5 % (5.0 )%
As a % of net sales 68.2 % 66.6 % 67.0 %

2017 compared with 2016
As reported, cost of sales increased by $238 million, or 8%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. Cost of sales was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $23 million. On a constant dollar basis, cost of sales increased $215 million, or

36

8%, primarily due to higher raw material costs on increased sales volumes, non-material inflation and freight costs and increase costs due to acquisitions.
2016 compared with 2015
As reported, costs of sales decreased $149 million, or 5%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. Cost of sales was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $86 million. On a constant dollar basis, cost of sales decreased $63 million, or 2%, primarily due to the divestiture of the North American foam trays and absorbent pads business and European food trays business of $79 million. This was partially offset by an increase in expenses representing higher non-material manufacturing and direct costs, including salary and wage inflation, partially offset by restructuring savings and lower incentive based compensation.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for three years ended December 31, are included in the table below.

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ------------- ---- ------------- ----- -------- - -------- ----- --- - ---- --

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
(In millions) 2017 2016 2015 % Change % Change
Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 796.0 $ 755.7 $ 778.0 5.3 % (2.9 )%
As a % of net sales 17.8 % 17.9 % 17.6 %

2017 compared with 2016

As reported, SG&A expenses increased $40 million, or 5%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. SG&A expenses were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $5 million. On a constant dollar basis, SG&A expenses increased $35 million, or 5%, primarily related to salary and wage inflation.
2016 compared with 2015
As reported, SG&A expenses decreased $22 million, or 3%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. SG&A expenses were impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $21 million. On a constant dollar basis, SG&A expenses were essentially the same as in the prior year, reflecting restructuring savings and lower incentive-based compensation, which more than offset salary inflation and targeted investments in sales and marketing.
Amortization Expense of Intangible Assets Acquired
Amortization expense of intangible assets acquired for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

-------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ------------- --- ------------- ---- -------- - -------- ---- ----- -- ---- -

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
(In millions) 2017 2016 2015 % Change % Change
Amortization expense of intangible assets acquired $ 13.1 $ 15.0 $ 11.1 (12.7 )% 35.1 %
As a % of net sales 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.3 %

From 2017 to 2016 amortization expense of intangible assets was minimally impacted by foreign currency translation. On a constant dollar basis, amortization expenses decreased $2 million, or 12%, primarily related to assets which were separated as part of the sale of Diversey. The increase from 2016 to 2015 was primarily due primarily related to increases in capitalized software due to the rollout of an ERP system.
Restructuring Activities

See Note 9, “Restructuring and Relocation Activities,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding each of the Company’s restructuring programs discussed below, restructuring plan’s accrual, spending and other activity for the year ended December 31, 2017.

37

As reported in our 2015 Form 10-K, our December 2011 Integration and Optimization Program (“IOP”) is substantially complete, while the May 2013 Earnings Quality Improvement Program (“EQIP”) is nearing completion. In the first quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors agreed to consolidate the remaining activities of those programs together with the December 2014 Fusion program to create a single program to be called the “Sealed Air Restructuring Program” or the “Program.”
The Program is estimated to generate incremental cost savings of $130 million to $150 million (which includes approximately $90 million related to Sealed Air's continuing operations) by the end of 2019, compared with the savings run rate achieved by the end of 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Program generated cost savings of $32 million, primarily in selling, general and administration expenses of which approximately $17 million of savings is in discontinued operations.
Additionally, the Program is expected to generate one-time cash benefits of approximately $70 million from the sale of certain assets, state and local incentives in connection with the relocation of the Company’s headquarters and reductions in working capital. Through December 31, 2017, we had generated $30 million in cash related to the sale of our facility located in Racine, Wisconsin, $10 million from other site sales and $9 million from grants and other working capital benefits.
The actual timing of future costs and cash payments related to the Program described above and our relocation activities are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the costs, spending and benefits to occur later than expected. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates may impact future costs, spending, benefits and cost synergies.
Interest Expense
Interest expense includes the stated interest rate on our outstanding debt, as well as the net impact of capitalized interest, the effects of interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs and credit facility fees, bond discounts, and terminated treasury locks.
Interest expense for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

(3) In June 2015, we issued $400 million of 5.50% senior notes due 2025 and €400 million of 4.50% senior notes due 2023 and used the net proceeds of these notes to retire the existing $750 million of 8.375% senior notes due 2021.

Loss on Debt Redemption and Refinancing Activities
In the second quarter 2015, we issued $400 million of 5.50% Senior Notes due September 15, 2025 and €400 million of 4.50% Senior Notes due September 15, 2023. The proceeds from these notes were used to repurchase the Company’s $750 million 8.375% Notes due September 2021. The aggregate repurchase price was $866 million, which included the principal amount of $750 million, a premium of $99 million and accrued interest of $17 million. We recognized a total pre-tax loss of $110 million on the repurchase, which included the premiums mentioned above. Also included in the loss on debt redemption was $11 million of accelerated amortization of original non-lender fees related to the 8.375% Senior Notes.
Sale of Equity Investment
In September 2007, we established a joint venture that supported our Food Care segment in Turkey. We accounted for the joint venture under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of net income or losses included in other expense, net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded other-than-temporary impairment of $26 million ($18 million, net of taxes, or $0.09 per diluted share). This impairment primarily consisted of the recognition of a current liability for the guarantee we issued related to the uncommitted credit facility of $20 million. The other component of the impairment was a $4 million write-down of the carrying value of the investment to zero at June 30, 2012. We also recorded provisions for bad debt on receivables due from the joint venture to the Company of $2 million, which was included in marketing, administrative and development expenses.
In the second quarter of 2015, Sealed Air sold its equity interest in the joint venture which had a carrying value of zero and in connection with the closing of this sale, Sealed Air and the other partner had to pay a portion of the outstanding debt that the joint venture owed for which Sealed Air had recorded a current liability in 2012.  At closing, Sealed Air also collected its outstanding receivables and paid certain payables to the joint venture. In July 2015, the partner paid the remaining outstanding debt balance and Sealed Air was relieved of its remaining guarantee obligation. Therefore, the remaining liability for the guarantee was reversed. As a result of these transactions, we recorded in 2015 pre-tax income of $9 million which was reflected as a Special Item and is excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA results. Included in this amount was $7 million related to the portion of the debt that the partner paid which is reflected in other income (expense), net, $2 million due to the reversal of allowance for bad debts which is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses and in other income (expense), net and less than $1 million related to the impact of the revaluation of the non-U.S. dollar-denominated contingent liability and the related foreign currency forward contracts which was included in other income, net.
Foreign Currency Exchange (Losses) Gains Related to Venezuelan Subsidiaries
Effective January 1, 2010, Venezuela was designated a highly inflationary economy. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses we recorded in 2016 and 2015 for our Venezuelan subsidiary were the result of the significant changes in the exchange rates used to remeasure our Venezuelan subsidiary’s financial statements at the balance sheet date. We believe these gains and losses are attributable to the unstable foreign currency environment in Venezuela.  See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the section “Impact of Inflation and Currency Fluctuation – Venezuela” for further details.
Ceasing Operations in Venezuela
Due to the ongoing challenging economic situation in Venezuela, the Company approved a program in the second quarter of 2016 to cease operations in the country. Foreign exchange control regulations have affected our Venezuelan subsidiaries ability to obtain inventory and maintain normal production. This resulted in total costs of $49 million being incurred which included the following (i) a voluntary reduction in headcount including severance and termination benefits for employees of less than $1 million, (ii) depreciation and amortization expense related to fixed assets and intangibles of $1 million, (iii) inventory reserves of less than $1 million and (iv) income tax expense of $1 million and (v) the reclassification of $47 million of cumulative translation adjustment resulting in a charge to Net income as the Company’s decision to cease operations is similar to a substantially complete liquidation.

Income Taxes
The table below shows our effective income tax rate (“ETR”).

---------- ------------------ -

Year Ended Effective Tax Rate
 2017 84.0 %
 2016 24.6 %
 2015 45.5 %

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 84.0%. The annual effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily as a result of expense related to the sale of Diversey, the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of U.S. Tax Reform and an increase in unrecognized foreign tax benefits.

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 24.6% and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 45.5%. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 is lower than the statutory rate primarily because of the mix of earnings and the change in our repatriation strategy.

Our effective income tax rate depends upon the realization of our net deferred tax assets. We have deferred tax assets related to accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes, foreign tax credits, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and investment tax allowances, employee benefit items, and other items.

The Internal Revenue Service (the “Service”) is currently auditing the 2011-2014 U.S. federal income tax returns of the Company.  Included in the audit of the 2014 return is the examination by the Service with respect to the Settlement agreement deduction and the related carryback to tax years 2004-2012. The outcome of the examination could affect the utilization of certain tax attributes and require us to make a significant payment.
We have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences, the future income from existing temporary differences, and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse.  If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Conversely, if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances, we may be able to reverse those valuation allowances. There was a negligible change in our valuation allowances for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Interest and penalties on tax assessments are included in income tax expense.
Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
Net earnings from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, are included in the table below.

--------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ------------- ------------- ----- -------- -------- ----- ----- -- ---- -

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
(In millions) 2017 2016 2015 % Change % Change
Net earnings from continuing operations $ 62.8 $ 292.3 $ 158.8 (78.5 )% 84.1 %

For 2017, net income was unfavorably impacted by $280 million of Special Items, primarily related to Tax Special Items related to the sale of Diversey of $152 million, charges related to the sale of Diversey of $55 million ($29 million, net of taxes) related to professional fees and restructuring, restructuring and other restructuring associated costs related to our restructuring program of $26 million ($21 million, net of taxes) and other acquisition and divestiture activity of $16 million ($13 million, net of taxes).
For 2016, net income was unfavorably impacted by $42 million of Special Items, including charges related ceasing operations in Venezuela of $49 million ($46 million, net of taxes), restructuring and other restructuring associated costs related to our restructuring programs of $22 million ($17 million, net of taxes), foreign currency exchange losses related to our

40

Venezuelan subsidiaries of $2 million ($2 million, net of taxes), and additional loss from the sale of our European food trays business and other divestitures of $2 million ($2 million, net of taxes).
For 2015, net income was unfavorably impacted by $221 million of Special Items, including loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities of $110 million ($72 million, net of taxes), restructuring and other associated costs related to our restructuring programs of $74 million ($53 million, net of taxes) and foreign currency exchange losses related to Venezuelan subsidiaries of $27 million ($27 million, net of taxes). These amounts were partially offset by the net gain on the sale of our North American foam trays and absorbent pads business and European food trays business of $13 million ($6 million, net of taxes) and Tax Special Items related to an increase in unrecognized tax benefits associated with the Settlement Agreement.
Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes
As a result of the sale of Diversey, the results of operations for Diversey are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a gain on the sale of Diversey of $641 million. Refer to Note 3, “Discontinued Operations, Divestitures and Acquisitions,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Diversey. Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes for December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are included in the table below.

------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ------------- ------------- ----- -------- -------- ----- ----- -- --- -

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015

Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes $ 111.4 $ 194.1 $ 176.6 (42.6 )% 9.9 %

The sale of Diversey was completed on September 6, 2017, as a result, the majority of the discontinued operations activity took place in the first eight months of the year. For December 31, 2017, net earnings from discontinued operations included $28 million of tax expense.

For December 31, 2016, net earnings from discontinued operations were favorably impacted by $16 million of reduced tax expense which is primarily related to the release of reserves, and a reduced tax rate because of the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.

For December 31, 2015, net earnings from discontinued operations were favorably impacted by $42 million of reduced tax expenses which is primarily related to the release of reserves and a reduced tax rate because of the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with lower tax rates.
Adjusted EBITDA by Segment

We allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although property and equipment, net is not allocated to the segment assets, nor is depreciation and amortization included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA. As of January 1, 2017 we modified our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude interest income. The impact in this modification was $8 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also allocate and disclose restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment, although it is not included in the segment performance metric Adjusted EBITDA since restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are categorized as Special Items. The accounting policies of the reportable segments and Corporate are the same as those applied to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
See Note 4, “Segments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations to Non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and other segment details.

(1) Corporate includes costs previously allocated to the Diversey Care segment and Food Hygiene and Cleaning business of our Food Care segment which are included as part of continuing operations of $14 million, $15 million and $16 million for December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively.

The following is a discussion of the factors that contributed to the change in Adjusted EBITDA by segment in the three years ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the prior year.
Food Care
2017 compared with 2016
Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $5 million. On a constant dollar basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $2 million, or less than 1%, in 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 primarily due to the impact of:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher non-material manufacturing costs of $28 million, including salary and wage inflation; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $22 million, primarily due to higher raw material and freight costs.

These drivers were partially offset by:

- ---------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of $44 million; and

- ------------------------------------
• restructuring savings of $5 million.

2016 compared with 2015
Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $24 million. On a constant dollar basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $14 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 primarily due to the impact of:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher operating expenses of approximately $33 million including salary and wage inflation, partially offset by a reduction in incentive-based compensation; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the effect of the divestitures of the North American foam trays and absorbent pads business and the European food trays businesses of $21 million.

These drivers were partially offset by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• favorable price/mix and margin expansion of approximately $14 million;

- -------------------------------------------------------
• restructuring savings of approximately $13 million; and

- -------------------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of approximately $14 million.

Product Care
2017 compared with 2016
Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of less than $1 million. On a constant dollar basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased $1 million, or less than 1%, in 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 primarily due to the impact of:

- ------------------------------------------
• positive volume trends of $37 million; and

42

- ------------------------------------
• restructuring savings of $2 million.

These drivers were offset by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• unfavorable mix and price/cost spread of $26 million primarily due to higher raw material and freight costs; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher non-material manufacturing costs of $12 million including salary and wage inflation.

2016 compared with 2015
Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $4 million. On a constant dollar basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased $12 million, or 4%, in 2016 compared with the same period in 2015 primarily due to the impact of:

- -----------------------------------------
• positive volume trends of $8 million; and

- ------------------------------------
• restructuring savings of $4 million.

Operating expenses were essentially flat compared to the prior year, which reflected salary and wage inflation offset by a reduction in incentive based compensation.

 Corporate
2017 compared with 2016
Corporate expenses decreased by $20 million or 16% on an as reported basis and constant dollar basis as compared with the same period in 2016. This was primarily driven by cost containment actions.
2016 compared with 2015
Corporate expenses increased by $12 million or 10% on an as reported basis and constant dollar basis as compared with the same period in 2015. This increase was attributable to higher selling and administrative expenses primarily due to the impact of annual salary increases and inflation.

Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our Amended Credit Facility, and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, stock repurchases, dividends, debt obligations, restructuring expenses and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above in the next twelve months.
As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $594 million, of which approximately $323 million, or 54%, was located outside of the U.S. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any cash trapped outside of the U.S. Our U.S. cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to U.S. borrowers were sufficient to fund our U.S. operating requirements and capital expenditures, current debt obligations and dividends. The Company does not expect that in the near term cash located outside of the U.S. will be needed to satisfy its obligations, dividends and other demands for cash in the U.S.
Material Commitments and Contingencies
Settlement Agreement and Related Costs
We recorded a pre-tax charge of $850 million in 2002, of which $513 million represented a cash payment that was due upon the effectiveness of a plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy of W. R. Grace & Co (“Grace”).  On February 3, 2014, upon Grace’s emergence from Bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization, the Settlement agreement was implemented and our subsidiary, Cryovac, Inc., made the payments contemplated by the settlement agreement consisting of aggregate cash payments of $930 million, including accrued interest, and the issuance of 18 million shares.
We deducted payments related to the Settlement agreement in our 2014 consolidated U.S. income tax return. As a result, we had a net operating loss for U.S. tax purposes in 2014 and carried back, for 10 years, more than $1 billion of the loss.
As a result of the loss carryback, we increased our unrecognized tax benefits by $104 million in 2015. While the Company believes it is more likely than not it will be successful in defending the deduction of the Settlement payment, the ultimate outcome of negotiations may affect the utilization of certain tax attributes and require us to make a significant payment.

(1) These amounts include principal maturities (at face value) only. These amounts also include our contractual obligations under capital leases of $1.4 million in 2018, $2.1 million in 2019-2020 and less than $1.0 million in 2021-2022.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) Includes interest payments required under our senior notes issuances and Amended Credit Facility only. The interest payments included above for our Term Loan A were calculated using the following assumptions:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• interest rates based on stated rates based on LIBOR as of December 31, 2017; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• all non-U.S. dollar balances are converted using exchange rates as of December 31, 2017.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Obligations related to defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans have been excluded from the table above, due to factors such as the retirement of employees, it is not reasonably possible to estimate when these obligations will become due. Refer to Note 14, “Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans,” and Note 15, “Other Post-Employment Benefits and Other Employee Benefit Plans,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these plans.

Current Portion of Long-Term Debt and Long-Term Debt — Represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period.
Operating Leases — The contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments primarily under non-cancelable real and personal property leases as of December 31, 2017.
Other Principal Contractual Obligations — Other principal contractual obligations include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services, including energy, in the normal course of business. These obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. The amounts included in the table above represent estimates of the minimum amounts we are obligated to pay, or reasonably likely to pay under these agreements. We may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and, as a result use additional cash.
Liability for Unrecognized Tax Benefits
At December 31, 2017, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $199 million. See Note 16, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

46

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have reviewed our off-balance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements has a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Income Tax Payments

Excluding payments associated with the U.S. transition tax, which the company is in the process of quantifying, we expect tax payments to be in the range of $150 to $190 million in 2018.
Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans
We maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our U.S. and our non-U.S. employees. We currently expect our contributions to these plans to be approximately $13 million in 2018. Refer to Note 14, “Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these plans.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, we adjust the recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents:

------------------------- ------------ ----- ---- - -----

 December 31,
(In millions) 2017 2016
Cash and cash equivalents $ 594.0 $ 333.7

See “Analysis of Historical Cash Flow” below.
Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs
At December 31, 2017 we had $156 million available to us under the programs of which we had no amounts outstanding. At December 31, 2016, we had $188 million available to us under the programs of which we had no amounts outstanding. See Note 8, “Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial for information concerning these programs.
Lines of Credit
We have a $700 million revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility.  See Note 11, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial for further details.

47

There was $23 million and $83 million outstanding under various lines of credit extended to our subsidiaries at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  See Note 11, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Covenants
At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations, as discussed in “Covenants” of Note 11, “Debt and Credit Facilities”, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Debt Ratings
Our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. Below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency.

------------------------------------- ------------------------ ----------------

 Moody’s InvestorServices Standard& Poor’s
Corporate Rating Ba2 BB+
Senior Unsecured Rating Ba3 BB+
Senior Secured Credit Facility Rating Baa3 BBB-
Outlook Stable Stable

These credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade (with the exception of the Baa3 and BBB- Senior Secured Credit Facility Rating from Moody’s Investor Services and Standard & Poor’s, respectively, which are classified as investment grade). If our credit ratings are downgraded, there could be a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and borrowing costs could increase. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Outstanding Indebtedness
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our total debt outstanding consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table.

--------------------------------------------- ------------ ------- ---- ------- - -------

 December 31,
(In millions) 2017 2016
Short-term borrowings $ 25.3 $ 83.0

See Note 11, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial for further details.
Analysis of Historical Cash Flow
The following table shows the changes in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

48

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ------ ---- ----- ------ - - -----

 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) 2017 2016 2015
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 424.4 $ 906.9 $ 982.1
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 1,813.6 (314.8 ) (60.0 )
Net cash used in financing activities (1,864.3 ) (540.9 ) (788.7 )
Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (113.4 ) (39.2 ) (60.4 )

In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures, including certain debt servicing requirements or non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from this measure. We historically have generated the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year. Below are the details of free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ----- ------ ------ ------ ----- ------------- - - ------------- ------ ------ - - ------ -

 Year Ended December 31, Change Change
(In millions) 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 424.4 $ 906.9 $ 982.1 $ (482.5 ) $ (75.2 )
Capital expenditures (183.8 ) (275.7 ) (184.0 ) 91.9 (275.9 )
Free cash flow(1) $ 240.6 $ 631.2 $ 798.1 $ (390.6 ) $ (166.9 )

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Free cash flow was $421 million in 2017 excluding the payment of charges related to the sale of Diversey of $181 million. Free cash flow was $609 million in 2015 excluding the tax refund received of $235 million in connection with the Settlement agreement and excess tax benefit of $46 million related to shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the terms of the Settlement agreement.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
2017
Net cash provided by operating activities of $424 million in 2017 was primarily attributable to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $815 million of net earnings, which included a reduction of $255 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities, including $641 million gain on the sale of Diversey, partially offset by adjustments for deferred taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based incentive compensation expenses and profit sharing expenses;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $17 million increase in working capital due to an increase in accounts payable partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory. This activity reflects the timing of inventory purchases and the related payments of cash along with the seasonality of sales and collections.

Partially offset by:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $48 million of changes in other assets and liabilities. This was primarily attributable to changes in restructuring liabilities, an increase in leased assets and the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments.

- ----------------------------------------------------
• payments of quarterly dividends of $120 million; and

51

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes in Working Capital

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------ ----- ---- ---- ------ ---- - -----

 December 31,
(In millions) 2017 2016 Change
Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) $ 488.2 $ 96.3 $ 391.9
Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 1.4x 1.0x
Quick ratio (current assets, less inventories divided by current liabilities) 1.0x 0.8x

The $392 million, or 375%, increase in working capital reflected:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in the current portion of debt of $295 million due to principal payments on Term Loan A due in 2017 of $250 million and the Brazilian tranche of Term Loan A for $96 million;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $260 million related to the cash received as part of the sale of Diversey; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in receivables consistent with the higher sales performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.

These were partially offset by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in accounts payable reflecting higher days payable outstanding consistent with utilization of structured payable arrangements as well as other initiatives for longer payment terms; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in current assets held for sale of $821 million partially offset by a decrease in liabilities held for sale of $681 million as the sale of Diversey was completed on September 6, 2017.

Changes in Stockholders’ Equity
The $457 million, or 75%, decrease in stockholders’ equity in 2017 compared with 2016 was primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a net increase in shares held in treasury of $1.2 billion and a decrease in additional paid in capital of $35 million due to the repurchase of common stock;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------
• dividends paid and accrued on our common stock of $119 million; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------
• unrealized losses on derivative instruments of $77 million.

Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements
We are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards,” which is contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence, including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions, management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts. These sources include our officers and other employees, outside consultants and legal counsel, third-party experts and actuaries. In addition, we use internally generated reports and statistics, such as aging of trade receivables, as well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry reports and third-party research studies. The results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, and any such differences may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments
In determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. We determine fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at measurement date.

Our fair value measurements for our financial instruments are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates. See Note 13, “Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our fair value measurements.
Commitments and Contingencies — Litigation
On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we consider insurance recoveries, if any. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. We have historically adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or for which additional information has been provided on which to review the probability and measurability of outcomes, and will continue to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products, and we consider revenues to be earned when we have completed the process by which we are entitled to receive consideration. The following criteria are used for revenue recognition: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, selling price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), (“ASU 2014-09”) and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance within ASU 2015-04, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12, ASU 2017-05, ASU 2017-10 and ASU 2017-13 (collectively, Topic 606). Previous revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP comprised broad revenue recognition concepts together with numerous revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in different accounting for economically similar transactions. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, ASU 2014-09 expands and enhances disclosure requirements which require disclosing sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. This includes both qualitative and quantitative information. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, (“ASU 2015-14”). The amendments in ASU 2015-14 delay the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and allow early adoption as of the original public entity effective date. The amendments in ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12, ASU 2017-05, ASU 2017-10 and ASU 2017-13 are effective in conjunction with ASU 2015-14.

54

The guidance permits two methods of adoption: full retrospective in which the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective where an entity will have to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. We will adopt the modified retrospective method.
For Sealed Air, the determination of whether an arrangement meets the definition of a contract under ASC 606 depends on whether it creates enforceable rights and obligations. While enforceability is a matter of law, we believe that enforceable rights and obligations in a contract must be substantive in order for the contract to be in scope of ASC 606. The penalty for noncompliance must be significant relative to the minimum obligation. Fixed or minimum purchase obligations were the most common examples of substantive enforceable rights present in our contracts. We determined that the contract term is the period of enforceability outlined by the terms of the contract. This means that in many cases, the term stated in the contract is different than the period of enforceability.
Our efforts to adopt this standard focused on contract analysis at a regional level. We have concluded our assessment and identified the most significant impact will be on the accounting for Free on Loan equipment in our Food Care division. Whereas today we do not recognize revenue on Free on Loan equipment, under the new standard, we anticipate allocating revenue to that equipment and account for the lease component under ASC 840. ASC 606-10-15-4 states that a contract can be partially in scope of ASC 606 and partially in scope of another standard, in this case ASC 840. Sealed Air determined the proper accounting treatment for contracts with lease and non-lease components would be to allocate the transaction price of the contract to the separate lease and non-lease components, account for the non-lease components of the contract under ASC 606 and account for the lease components of the contract under ASC 840. During the contract analysis we also evaluated how the transaction price would be allocated across the performance obligations. It highlighted the need to adjust our equipment accrual balance, within the Food Care division, to reflect the stand alone selling price of the equipment within our portfolio.
Based on the information we have evaluated to date, we do not anticipate that the adoption of the amendments will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements with the exception of new and expanded disclosures. That said we currently estimate the adjustment will result in a reduction to the opening balance of retained earnings in the range of $1 to $5 million.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
For finite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships, contracts and intellectual property, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are present, we perform a review for impairment. We calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount is found to be greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them as appropriate.
For indefinite–lived intangible assets, such as trademarks and trade names, each year and whenever impairment indicators are present, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value, if any. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate.
Asset Retirement Obligations
The company records asset retirement obligations at fair value at the time the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Accretion expense is recognized as an operating expense using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate in effect when the liability was recognized. The associated asset retirement obligations are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset.
Goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year. A review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable.
A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segment - the “component” level - discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit.

55

As part of the annual impairment test, we may conduct an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In a qualitative assessment, we would consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general conditions, industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and regulator and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation, and events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets.
If an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed, we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the two-step process. In step one, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no indication of impairment and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we must perform step two of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In step two, the reporting unit’s fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.
We use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment. We must recognize a non-cash impairment charge for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches, each based on an applicable weighting. We assess the applicable weighting based on such factors as current market conditions and the quality and reliability of the data. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value.
Fair value computed by these methods is arrived at using a number of factors, including projected future operating results, anticipated future cash flows, effective income tax rates, comparable marketplace data within a consistent industry grouping, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Assumptions for sales, net earnings and cash flows for each reporting unit were consistent among these methods.
Income Approach Used to Determine Fair Values
The income approach is based upon the present value of expected cash flows. Expected cash flows are converted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk of the future cash flows. The estimate of cash flows used is prepared on an unleveraged debt-free basis. We use a discount rate that reflects a market-derived weighted average cost of capital. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating and cash flow performance. The projections are based upon our best estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period including growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value long-term growth rates, provisions for income taxes, future capital expenditures and changes in future cashless, debt-free working capital.
Annual Goodwill Impairment Test

The Company performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of October 1, 2017, during the fourth quarter of 2017, and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amount. In the fourth quarter 2016 and 2015, we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units that have goodwill allocated and no impairment was identified.
Market Approaches Used to Determine Fair Values
We consider various relevant market approaches that could be used to determine fair value.
The first market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by applying multiples of operating performance measures to the reporting unit’s operating performance (the “Public Company Method”). These multiples are derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar investment characteristics to the reporting unit, and such comparables are reviewed and updated as needed annually. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate

56

using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units and the Company. The second market approach is based on the publicly traded common stock of the Company, and the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is based on the applicable multiples of the Company (the “Quoted Price Method”). The third market approach is based on recent mergers and acquisitions of comparable publicly-traded and privately-held companies in our industries (the “Mergers and Acquisition Method”).
The key estimates and assumptions that are used to determine fair value under these market approaches include current and forward 12-month operating performance results, as applicable and the selection of the relevant multiples to be applied. Under the Public Company and the Quoted Price Methods, a control premium, or an amount that a buyer is usually willing to pay over the current market price of a publicly traded company, is applied to the calculated equity values to adjust the public trading value upward for a 100% ownership interest, where applicable.
In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units, we also compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization). We evaluate the control premium by comparing it to control premiums of recent comparable market transactions. If the implied control premium is not reasonable in light of these recent transactions, we will reevaluate our fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and/or other assumptions.
If our assumptions and related estimates change in the future, or if we change our reporting unit structure or other events and circumstances change (such as a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock, a decline in current market multiples, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climates, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, heightened competition, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions or a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of), we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods. Any impairment charges that we may take in the future could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
See Note 7, “Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of our goodwill balance and the goodwill review performed in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and other related information.
Pensions
For a number of our U.S. employees and our international employees, we maintain defined benefit pension plans. Under current accounting standards, we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans.
The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third-party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a plan-by-plan basis each fiscal year. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted-average expected return on our asset allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is based on our long-term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31 for all material plans (November 30 for non-material plans).
At December 31, 2017, the total projected benefit obligation for our U.S. pension plans was $205 million, and the total benefit income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was entirely offset by settlement and curtailment costs At December 31, 2017, the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was $702 million, and the total benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1 million.
In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases (decreases)

Income Taxes
Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences, tax benefit carryforwards and foreign tax credits. We evaluate whether our taxable earnings, during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized, should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration dates of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, we provide a valuation allowance.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards and past operating results, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes, we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, we may establish reserves for additional taxes and interest that could be assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. We adjust these reserves to take into account changing facts and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. If the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the reserve, the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the reserves are no longer necessary. If an estimate of tax reserves proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to income tax provision would result. These adjustments to reserves and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities. See Note 16, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards.

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS TubeMogul On December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired.

NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. As of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry-retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French's®, Frank's RedHot® and Cattlemen's®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and industrial segments. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of RB Foods were approximately $570 million. The transaction was accounted for under the acquisiti...

(2) The tax rate used to calculate the tax impact of Special Items is based on the jurisdiction in which the charge was recorded.

Foreign Currency Translation Impact on Consolidated Financial Results
Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency-denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact. Historically, the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro, the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Venezuelan bolivar.
The following table presents the approximate favorable or (unfavorable) impact foreign currency translation had on some of our consolidated financial results:

-------------------------------------------- ------------- ---- ------------- ----- - ------ -

(In millions) 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
Net sales $ 29.9 $ (124.9 )
Cost of sales (22.5 ) 85.6
Selling, general and administrative expenses (4.9 ) 20.8
Net earnings (0.9 ) 17.0
Adjusted EBITDA 4.9 (39.1 )

Net Sales by Geographic Region

The following tables present the components of the change in net sales by geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with 2015. We also present the change in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, which we define as “constant dollar.” We believe using constant dollar measures aids in the comparability between periods as it eliminates the volatility of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Food Care
2017 compared with 2016
As reported, net sales increased $128 million, or 5%, in 2017 compared with 2016, of which $27 million was due to positive currency impact. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $102 million, or 4%, in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of $117 million, reflecting an increase in North America on strong demand of protein packaging and more modest increases in EMEA and Latin America.

This was partially offset by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower unit volumes in APAC of $14 million primarily due to the continuation of historically low slaughter rates in Australia; and

- ------------------------------------
• unfavorable price/mix of $1 million.

2016 compared with 2015
As reported, net sales decreased $169 million, or 6%, in 2016 compared with 2015, of which $103 million was due to negative currency impact. On a constant dollar basis, net sales decreased $67 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the divestiture of our North American foam trays and absorbent pads and European food trays businesses of $102 million; and

35

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower unit volumes of $39 million, reflecting continued economic uncertainty and social and political instability in Latin America, and lower demand in Asia Pacific driven by historically low slaughter rates in Australia.

These were partially offset by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of $64 million, in North America and EMEA combined with strong demand within our core product portfolio, adoption of new products and increased market penetration of advanced packaging solutions; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• favorable price/mix of $9 million reflecting an increase in Latin America and EMEA, primarily due to pricing initiatives implemented to offset currency devaluation, a favorable mix of new higher margin products and the implementation of value-added pricing initiatives and non-material inflationary costs, which was partially offset by unfavorable price/mix in North America primarily attributable to the timing of formula pricing adjustments at key customers.

Product Care
2017 compared with 2016
As reported, net sales increased $122 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared with 2016, of which $3 million was due to positive currency impact. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $119 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• incremental sales resulting from the acquisition of Fagerdala in Singapore of $24 million;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of $86 million across all regions, primarily in North America due to ongoing strength in the e-Commerce and third party logistics markets as well as increased volume units in APAC; and

- ----------------------------------
• favorable price/mix of $9 million.

2016 compared with 2015
As reported, net sales decreased $30 million, or 2%, in 2016 compared with 2015, of which $22 million was due to negative currency impact. On a constant dollar basis, net sales decreased $7 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the following:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower unit volumes of $39 million primarily due to rationalization and weakness in the industrial sector, as well as declines in Latin America due to the political and economic environment; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• unfavorable price/mix of $29 million primarily in North America driven by targeted pricing incentives and an unfavorable product mix related to accelerated growth in e-Commerce and a shift in demand due to more innovative, resource-efficient solutions.

This was partially offset by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher unit volumes of $64 million, primarily in North America and EMEA due to ongoing strength in the e-Commerce and third party logistics markets.

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for three years ended December 31, were as follows:

------------------- ----------------------- ------- ------------- ------- ------------- ------- -------- - -------- ------- - ---- -- ---- --

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
(In millions) 2017 2016 2015 % Change % Change
Net sales $ 4,461.6 $ 4,211.3 $ 4,410.3 5.9 % (4.5 )%
Cost of sales 3,044.4 2,806.4 2,955.1 8.5 % (5.0 )%
As a % of net sales 68.2 % 66.6 % 67.0 %

2017 compared with 2016
As reported, cost of sales increased by $238 million, or 8%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. Cost of sales was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $23 million. On a constant dollar basis, cost of sales increased $215 million, or

36

8%, primarily due to higher raw material costs on increased sales volumes, non-material inflation and freight costs and increase costs due to acquisitions.
2016 compared with 2015
As reported, costs of sales decreased $149 million, or 5%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. Cost of sales was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $86 million. On a constant dollar basis, cost of sales decreased $63 million, or 2%, primarily due to the divestiture of the North American foam trays and absorbent pads business and European food trays business of $79 million. This was partially offset by an increase in expenses representing higher non-material manufacturing and direct costs, including salary and wage inflation, partially offset by restructuring savings and lower incentive based compensation.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for three years ended December 31, are included in the table below.

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ------------- ---- ------------- ----- -------- - -------- ----- --- - ---- --

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
(In millions) 2017 2016 2015 % Change % Change
Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 796.0 $ 755.7 $ 778.0 5.3 % (2.9 )%
As a % of net sales 17.8 % 17.9 % 17.6 %

2017 compared with 2016

As reported, SG&A expenses increased $40 million, or 5%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. SG&A expenses were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $5 million. On a constant dollar basis, SG&A expenses increased $35 million, or 5%, primarily related to salary and wage inflation.
2016 compared with 2015
As reported, SG&A expenses decreased $22 million, or 3%, in 2016 as compared to 2015. SG&A expenses were impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $21 million. On a constant dollar basis, SG&A expenses were essentially the same as in the prior year, reflecting restructuring savings and lower incentive-based compensation, which more than offset salary inflation and targeted investments in sales and marketing.
Amortization Expense of Intangible Assets Acquired
Amortization expense of intangible assets acquired for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

-------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- ------------- --- ------------- ---- -------- - -------- ---- ----- -- ---- -

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015
(In millions) 2017 2016 2015 % Change % Change
Amortization expense of intangible assets acquired $ 13.1 $ 15.0 $ 11.1 (12.7 )% 35.1 %
As a % of net sales 0.3 % 0.4 % 0.3 %

From 2017 to 2016 amortization expense of intangible assets was minimally impacted by foreign currency translation. On a constant dollar basis, amortization expenses decreased $2 million, or 12%, primarily related to assets which were separated as part of the sale of Diversey. The increase from 2016 to 2015 was primarily due primarily related to increases in capitalized software due to the rollout of an ERP system.
Restructuring Activities

See Note 9, “Restructuring and Relocation Activities,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding each of the Company’s restructuring programs discussed below, restructuring plan’s accrual, spending and other activity for the year ended December 31, 2017.

As reported in our 2015 Form 10-K, our December 2011 Integration and Optimization Program (“IOP”) is substantially complete, while the May 2013 Earnings Quality Improvement Program (“EQIP”) is nearing completion. In the first quarter of 2016, the Board of Directors agreed to consolidate the remaining activities of those programs together with the December 2014 Fusion program to create a single program to be called the “Sealed Air Restructuring Program” or the “Program.”
The Program is estimated to generate incremental cost savings of $130 million to $150 million (which includes approximately $90 million related to Sealed Air']:

["). The sale of Diversey was completed on September 6, 2017. The net assets of Diversey met the criteria to be classified as “held for sale” for the period ended December 31, 2016. Results of operations for Diversey are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented. See Note 3, “Discontinued Operations, Divestitures and Acquisitions” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The Company’s segment reporting structure now consists of two reportable segments and a Corporate category as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Food Care (including Medical Applications and New Ventures businesses); and

- -------------
• Product Care.

The Company’s Food Care and Product Care segments are considered reportable segments under FASB ASC Topic 280. Our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products and management team. Corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable segments, primarily consisting of unallocated corporate overhead costs, including administrative functions and cost recovery variances not allocated to the reportable segments from global functional expenses.
See Note 4, “Segments” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Overview
We are a global leader in food safety and security and product protection. We serve an array of end markets including food and beverage processing, food service, retail, healthcare and industrial, and commercial and consumer applications. Our focus is on achieving quality sales growth through leveraging our geographic footprint, technological know-how and leading market positions to bring measurable, sustainable value to our customers, employees and investors. We have widely recognized and inventive brands such as Cryovac® packaging technology, and our Bubble Wrap® brand cushioning, Jiffy® protective mailers, and Instapak® foam-in-place systems.
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 2,300 sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a large number of distributors, fabricators, converters, e-commerce and mail order fulfillment firms, and contract packaging firms as well as directly to end-users such as food processors, food service businesses, supermarket retailers, lodging, retail pharmaceutical companies, healthcare facilities, medical device manufacturers, and other manufacturers. We have no material long-term contracts for the distribution of our products. In 2017, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales.
Historically, net sales in our Food Care segment have tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter, due to holiday events. Net sales in our Product Care segment have also tended to be slightly lower in the first quarter and higher in the mid-third quarter and through the fourth quarter due to the holiday shopping season. On a consolidated basis, there is little seasonality in the business with net sales slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter. Our consolidated net earnings typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality. Cash flow from operations tends to be higher in the second half of the year, reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes, including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments.
Other factors may outweigh the effects of seasonal changes in our net earnings results including, but not limited to, changes in raw materials and other costs, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, taxes and the timing and amount of acquisition synergies and restructuring and other non-recurring charges.
Competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, service and price. Since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology, we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership. Competition is both global and regional in scope and

29

includes numerous small, local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach. For more details, see “Competition” included in Part I, Item 1 “Business.”
Our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. Our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs, including petrochemical-related costs (primarily resin costs), which are not within our control. Consequently, our management focuses on reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemical-based and other raw materials as efficiently as possible. We also believe that our global presence helps to insulate us from localized changes in business conditions.
We manage our businesses to generate substantial operating cash flow. We believe that our operating cash flow will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property and equipment and acquisitions. Moreover, we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders.
