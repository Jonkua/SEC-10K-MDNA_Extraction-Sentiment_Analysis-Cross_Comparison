Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources,” amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our senior unsecured term loan credit facility bear interest at variable rates. Our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $202.1 million at December 31, 2017. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures.

Interest Rate Risk—Sensitivity. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows:

(i) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows to fluctuate. An increase of 10%, or approximately 26 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $2.2 million for fiscal year 2018.

(ii) Changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate.
