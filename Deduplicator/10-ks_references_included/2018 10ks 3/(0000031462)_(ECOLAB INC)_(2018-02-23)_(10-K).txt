Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

			The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the impact of changes in volume and pricing and the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and reportable segment level. We also provide quantitative information regarding special (gains) and charges, discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. Such quantitative drivers are supported by comments meant to be qualitative in nature. Qualitative factors are generally ordered based on estimated significance.

			The discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This discussion contains various Non-GAAP Financial Measures and also contains various forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements and information set forth in the sections entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” at the end of this MD&A, and “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K.

   Comparability of Results

   Fixed Currency Foreign Exchange Rates

			Management evaluates the sales and operating income performance of our non-U.S. dollar functional currency international operations based on fixed currency exchange rates, which eliminate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our international operations. Fixed currency amounts are updated annually at the beginning of each year based on translation into U.S. dollars at foreign currency exchange rates established by management, with all periods presented using such rates. Fixed currency exchange rates are generally based on existing market rates at the time they are established. Fixed currency amounts for 2015 also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at the Marginal Currency System (“SIMADI”) rate at year end 2015 of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. Public currency rate data provided within the “Segment Performance” section of this MD&A reflect amounts translated at actual public average rates of exchange prevailing during the corresponding period, and is provided for informational purposes only.

   Venezuela Related Activities

			Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Prior to deconsolidation, due to the country’s highly inflationary economy, the functional currency of our Venezuelan subsidiaries was the U.S. dollar. As a result, currency remeasurement adjustments for non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and other transactional foreign currency exchange gains and losses were reflected in earnings. Across the second through fourth quarters of 2015, the Venezuelan bolivar operations within our Water, Paper, Food & Beverage, Institutional and Energy operating segments were converted from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar to the SIMADI rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. As noted above, within our fixed currency sales and operating results, to present our historical Venezuelan bolivar operations at a consistent conversion rate, we have reflected all Venezuelan bolivar results for the 2015 reporting year at a SIMADI conversion rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar.

   Impact of Acquisitions and Divestitures

			Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from all comparable periods.

   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

			We achieved accelerating sales and earnings growth through 2017 as we drove new product introductions, new business wins and improved operating efficiency in a mixed market environment. Increased pricing was implemented to offset higher delivered product costs. Earnings per share leveraged the solid operating income growth, benefiting from lower interest expense, taxes and shares outstanding, to deliver the solid EPS growth.

   Sales

			Reported sales increased 5% to $13.8 billion in 2017 from $13.2 billion in 2016. Sales were positively impacted by volume, pricing and acquisitions. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, fixed currency sales increased 5% compared to the prior year. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the “Net Sales” table on page 32 and the “Sales by Reportable Segment” table on page 38 for reconciliation information.

   Table of Contents

   Gross Margin

			Our reported gross margin was 46.5% of sales for 2017, compared to our 2016 reported gross margin of 47.5%. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges included in cost of sales from both 2017 and 2016, our adjusted gross margin was 46.8% in 2017 and 48.0% in 2016. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the “Cost of Sales and Gross Profit Margin” table on page 32 for reconciliation information.

   Operating Income

			Reported operating income increased 5% to $2.0 billion in 2017, compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. Adjusted operating income, excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, increased 2% in 2017. When measured in fixed rates of foreign currency exchange, adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 2%. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures and the “Operating Income” table on page 35 and “Operating Income by Reportable Segment” table on page 38 for reconciliation information.

   Earnings Attributable to Ecolab Per Common Share (“EPS”)

			Reported diluted EPS increased 24% to $5.13 in 2017 compared to $4.14 in 2016. Special (gains) and charges had an impact on both years. Special (gains) and charges in 2017 were driven primarily by the impact of income tax reform, restructuring charges, other discrete taxes, acquisition and integration charges and the gain on sale of Equipment Care. Special (gains) and charges in 2016 were driven primarily by Energy related charges, Venezuelan related actions, restructuring charges and other gains and charges. Adjusted diluted EPS, which exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items increased to $4.69 in 2017 compared to $4.37 in 2016. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures, and the “Diluted EPS” table on page 37 for reconciliation information.

   Balance Sheet

			We remain committed to our stated objective of having an investment grade balance sheet, supported by our current credit ratings of A-/Baa1 by the major ratings agencies, and to achieving “A” range ratings metrics. We believe our strong balance sheet has allowed us continued access to capital at attractive rates.

   Net Debt to EBITDA

			Our net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) was 2.4 and 2.3 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA, defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA, was 2.4 for 2017 and 2.2 for 2016. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization. See the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” within this MD&A for further information on our non-GAAP measures, and the “Net Debt to EBITDA” table on page 43 for reconciliation information.

   Cash Flow

			Cash flow from operating activities was $2.1 billion in 2017 compared to $1.9 billion in 2016. We continued to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in our business, debt repayments, pension obligations and return cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. See the section entitled “Cash Flows” within this MD&A for further information.

   Dividends

			We increased our quarterly cash dividend 11% in December 2017 to an indicated annual rate of $1.64 per share. The increase represents our 26th consecutive annual dividend rate increase and the 81st consecutive year we have paid cash dividends. Our outstanding dividend history reflects our continued growth and development, strong cash flows, solid financial position and confidence in our business prospects for the years ahead.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

   Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (“Notes”).

			Preparation of our consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria: (1) the estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made, and (2) different estimates that we reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations.

			Besides estimates that meet the “critical” estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed critical, affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, even from estimates not deemed critical. Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

   Revenue Recognition

			We recognize revenue on product sales at the time evidence of an arrangement exists, title to the product and risk of loss transfers to the customer, the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue on services as they are performed. While we employ a sales and service team to ensure our customers’ needs are best met in a high quality way, the majority of our revenue is generated from product sales. Our service businesses and service offerings are discussed in Note 17.

			Our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated uncollectible accounts, as discussed below. Depending on market conditions, we may increase customer incentive offerings, which could reduce gross profit margins over the term of the incentive.

			On January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Committee 606 (ASC 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance on how revenue with customers should be recognized. For additional information on our adoption of this accounting standard, see Note 2.

   Valuation Allowances and Accrued Liabilities

   Allowances for Doubtful Accounts

			We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age and applying historical write-off and collection trend rates. In addition, our estimates also include separately providing for customer receivables based on specific circumstances and credit conditions, and when it is deemed probable the balance is uncollectible. We estimate our sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits, and apply these trend rates to calculate estimated reserves for future credits. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

			Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was $72 million and $68 million, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts include our allowance for sales returns and credits of $15 million and $14 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our bad debt expense as a percent of reported net sales was 0.1% in 2017 and 0.2% in 2016 and 2015. We believe it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, or if unexpected events, economic downturns, or significant changes in future trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required.

			For additional information on our allowance for doubtful accounts, see Note 2.

   Table of Contents

   Accrued Liabilities

			Our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. As with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar products and services, some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations.

			We record liabilities related to pending litigation, environmental claims and other contingencies when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Estimates used to record such liabilities are based on our best estimate of probable future costs. We record the amounts that represent the points in the range of estimates that we believe are most probable or the minimum amount when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Potential insurance reimbursements generally are not anticipated in our accruals for environmental liabilities or other insured losses. Expected insurance proceeds are recorded as receivables when recovery is deemed certain. While the final resolution of litigation and environmental contingencies could result in amounts different than current accruals, and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position.

			For additional information on our commitments and contingencies, see Note 15.

   Actuarially Determined Liabilities

   Pension and Postretirement Healthcare Benefit Plans

   The measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are dependent on a variety of assumptions determined by management and used by our actuaries. These assumptions affect the amount and timing of future contributions and expenses.

			The significant assumptions used in developing the required estimates are the discount rate, expected return on assets, projected salary and health care cost increases and mortality table.

 · The discount rate assumptions for our U.S. plans are assessed using a yield curve constructed from a subset of bonds yielding greater than the median return from a population of non-callable, corporate bond issues rated Aa by Moody’s Investor Services or AA by Standard & Poors. The discount rate is calculated by matching the plans’ projected cash flows to the bond yield curve. For 2017 and 2016, we elected to measure service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans’ liability cash flows. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. For 2015, we measured service and interest costs utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the plan obligations. The change in approach did not affect the measurement of our plan obligations or the funded status of our plans. In determining our U.S. pension obligations for 2017, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 3.70% from 4.27% at year-end 2016. In determining our U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2017, our weighted-average discount rate decreased to 3.66% from 4.14% at year-end 2016.

 · The expected rate of return on plan assets reflects asset allocations, investment strategies and views of investment advisors, and represents our expected long-term return on plan assets. Our weighted-average expected return on U.S. plan assets used for determining the 2016, 2017 and 2018 U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care expenses was 7.75%.

 · Projected salary and health care cost increases are based on our long-term actual experience, the near term outlook and assumed inflation. Our weighted-average projected salary increase used in determining the 2016 U.S. pension expenses was 4.32%, for 2017 it was 4.03%, and for 2018 it is 4.03%.

 · For postretirement benefit measurement purposes as of December 31, 2017, the annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed to be 8.25% for pre-65 costs and 11.5% for post-65 costs. The rates are assumed to decrease each year until they reach 5% in 2028 and remain at those levels thereafter.

 · In determining our U.S. pension and U.S. postretirement health care obligation for 2017, we utilized the most recent mortality table, MP-2017 projection scale (applied to the RP-2006 mortality table).

			The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions, as well as changes in assumptions, are reflected in the unrecognized actuarial loss and amortized over future periods and, therefore, will generally affect our recognized expense in future periods. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension and other postretirement obligations. The unrecognized net actuarial loss on our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans decreased to $527 million as of December 31, 2017 from $533 million as of December 31, 2016 (both before tax), primarily due to the amortization of prior period net actuarial losses.

			The effect of a decrease in the discount rate or decrease in the expected return on assets assumption as of December 31, 2017, on the December 31, 2017 funded status and 2018 expense is shown below, assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for our significant U.S. plans:

------------------------- ---------------------------- ----------- ----- ------- ----

 Health Care Benefits Plans
 Increase in Higher
 Assumption Recorded 2018

			Our international pension obligations and underlying plan assets represent approximately one third of our global pension plans, with the majority of the amounts held in the U.K. and Eurozone countries. We use assumptions similar to our U.S. plan assumptions to measure our international pension obligations, however, the assumptions used vary by country based on specific local country requirements and information.

			See Note 16 for further discussion concerning our accounting policies, estimates, funded status, contributions and overall financial positions of our pension and postretirement plan obligations.

   Self Insurance

			Globally we have insurance policies with varying deductible levels for property and casualty losses. We are insured for losses in excess of these deductibles, subject to policy terms and conditions and have recorded both a liability and an offsetting receivable for amounts in excess of these deductibles. We are self-insured for health care claims for eligible participating employees, subject to certain deductibles and limitations. We determine our liabilities for claims on an actuarial basis.

   Restructuring

			Our restructuring activities are associated with plans to enhance our efficiency, effectiveness and sharpen the competitiveness of our businesses. These restructuring plans include net costs associated with significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs and asset write-downs and disposals. Employee termination costs are largely based on policies and severance plans, and include personnel reductions and related costs for severance, benefits and outplacement services. These charges are reflected in the quarter in which the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Contract termination costs include charges to terminate leases prior to the end of their respective terms and other contract termination costs. Asset write-downs and disposals include leasehold improvement write-downs, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations and disposal of assets.

			Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Amounts included as a component of cost of sales include supply chain related severance and other asset write-downs associated with combining operations. Restructuring liabilities have been classified as a component of both other current and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our restructuring liability balance was $42 million and $40 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

			For additional information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3.

Income Taxes

			Judgment is required to determine the annual effective income tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions.

			On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously indefinitely reinvested and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Tax Act adds many new provisions including changes to bonus depreciation, the deduction for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low taxed income (GILTI), the base erosion anti abuse tax (BEAT) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (FDII). Some of these provisions, such as the tax on GILTI, may not apply to the Company with full effect until future years. The Company is assessing the impact of the provisions of the Act that do not apply until later years.

			The two material items that impact us for 2017 are the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate, as it relates to deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet, and the one-time transition tax that is imposed on our unremitted foreign earnings. We have recorded provisional amounts for the income tax effects that included the reporting period the Tax Act was enacted. Judgement was used when applying the provisions of the Tax Act, including assumptions related to the impact of the lower corporate rate, and other analyses including, but not limited to, estimates of assets and liabilities at future dates and our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income. Our provisional amounts are subject to further adjustments during the measurement period of up to one year following enactment of the Tax Act, as provided by recent SEC guidance.

   Effective Income Tax Rate

			Our effective income tax rate is based on annual income, statutory tax rates and tax planning available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our annual effective income tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions. We recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances. This expected annual rate is then applied to our year-to-date operating results. In the event that there is a significant discrete item recognized in our interim operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the same period.

			Tax regulations require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, the effective income tax rate reflected in our financial statements differs from that reported in our tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on our tax return, and some are temporary differences, such as depreciation expense.

   Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities and Valuation Allowances

			Temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the utilization of the entire deduction or credit. Relevant factors in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets include historical results, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return, but have not yet recognized that tax benefit in our financial statements.

			Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, U.S. deferred income taxes had not been provided on certain unremitted foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to have been reinvested indefinitely or are available for distribution with foreign tax credits available to offset the amount of applicable income tax and foreign withholding taxes that might be payable on earnings. Upon enactment of the Tax Act, we recorded a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is payable over eight years. We will continue to assert permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates, and if our policy changes we would record applicable taxes.

   For additional information on income taxes see Note 12.

   Uncertain Tax Positions

			A number of years may elapse before a particular tax matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of tax years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has completed its examinations of our federal income tax returns (Ecolab and Nalco) through 2014. Our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2015 and 2016 are currently under audit. In addition to the U.S. federal examinations, we have ongoing audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.

   30

   Table of Contents

			The tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal, state and international jurisdictions. We believe our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations, and our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken. Because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations, we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits (including related interest and penalties) for amounts that do not meet the more-likely-than-not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance. The tax reserves are reviewed throughout the year, taking into account new legislation, regulations, case law and audit results. Settlement of any particular issue could result in offsets to other balance sheet accounts, cash payments or receipts and/or adjustments to tax expense. The majority of our tax reserves are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within other non-current liabilities. Our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $62 million and $76 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

   For additional information on income taxes see Note 12.

   Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill

   Long-Lived and Amortizable Intangible Assets

			We periodically review our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets, the net value of which was $7.0 billion and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for impairment and to assess whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or in its physical condition or history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. Impairment losses could occur when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.

			We use the straight-line method to recognize amortization expense related to our amortizable intangible assets, including our customer relationships. We consider various factors when determining the appropriate method of amortization for our customer relationships, including projected sales data, customer attrition rates and length of key customer relationships.

			Globally, we have a broad customer base. Our retention rate of significant customers has aligned with our acquisition assumptions, including the customer base acquired in our recent Nalco and Champion transactions, which make up the majority of our unamortized customer relationships. Our historical retention rate, coupled with our consistent track record of keeping long-term relationships with our customers, supports our expectation of consistent sales generation for the foreseeable future from the acquired customer base. Our customer retention rate and history of maintaining long-term relationships with our significant customers are not expected to change in the future. Additionally, other less certain post-acquisition operational assumptions related to future capital investments and working capital, as well as the impact of discount rate assumptions, induce variability and uncertainty in the pattern of economic benefits of our acquired customer relationships. If our customer retention rate or other post-acquisition operational activities changed materially, we would evaluate the financial impact and any corresponding triggers which could result in an acceleration of amortization or impairment of our customer relationship intangible assets.

   In addition, we periodically reassess the estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived and amortizable intangible assets. Changes to estimated useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings. We have experienced no significant changes in the carrying value or estimated remaining useful lives of our long-lived or amortizable intangible assets.

   Goodwill and Indefinite Life Intangible Assets

			We had total goodwill of $7.2 billion and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis during the second quarter. Our reporting units are aligned with our eleven operating segments (ten subsequent to the divestiture of the Equipment Care business).

			For our 2017 impairment assessment, we completed our assessment for goodwill impairment across our eleven reporting units through a quantitative analysis, utilizing a discounted cash flow approach. The two-step quantitative process involved comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss to be recorded, if any. Our goodwill impairment assessment for 2017 indicated the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the unit’s carrying amount by a significant margin. We will continue to assess the need to test our reporting units for impairment during interim periods between our scheduled annual assessments. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we sold the Equipment Care business, which was one of our reporting units and operating segments, and the goodwill associated with Equipment Care was disposed of upon sale. No goodwill impairment was realized as a result of the sale, and no other events occurred during the second half of 2017 indicating a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2017.

			As part of the Nalco merger, we added the “Nalco” trade name as an indefinite life intangible asset, the total value of which was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2016. The carrying value of the indefinite life trade name was subject to annual impairment testing, using a relief from royalty assessment method, during the second quarter of 2017. Based on this testing, no adjustment to the carrying value was necessary. Additionally, no events during the second half of 2017 indicated a need to update our conclusions reached during the second quarter of 2017.

   Our COS values and corresponding gross margin are shown in the previous table. Our gross margin is defined as sales less cost of sales divided by sales.

			Our reported gross margin was 46.5%, 47.5%, and 46.7% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our 2017, 2016 and 2015 reported gross margins were negatively impacted by special (gains) and charges of $44.0 million, $66.0 million, and $80.6 million, respectively. Special (gains) and charges items impacting COS are shown within the “Special (Gains) and Charges” table on page 33.

			Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our 2017 adjusted gross margin was 46.8% compared against a 2016 adjusted gross margin of 48.0%. The decrease was driven primarily by higher delivered product costs and an increase in Global Energy (which on average has a lower gross margin), which more than offset pricing and cost savings.

			Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges, our adjusted gross margin was 48.0% and 47.3% for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by lower delivered product costs, cost efficiencies and the impact of the decline in Global Energy, which on average has a lower gross margin.

   Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)

---------- ---- - ---- ---- ---- ---- -
(percent) 2017 2016 2015
SG&A Ratio 31.9 % 32.7 % 32.1 %

			The decreased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2017 against 2016 was driven primarily by sales volume leverage and cost savings, which more than offset investments in the business and the impact of acquisitions.

			The increased SG&A ratio (SG&A expenses as a percentage of reported net sales) comparing 2016 against 2015 was driven primarily by the impact of acquisitions, investments in the business, and the decline in Global Energy, which on average has a lower SG&A ratio.

			For segment reporting purposes, special (gains) and charges are not allocated to reportable segments, which is consistent with our internal management reporting.

   Restructuring Activities

			Restructuring charges have been included as a component of cost of sales, special (gains) and charges and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Further details related to our restructuring charges are included in Note 3.

			During the second quarter of 2017, we commenced restructuring and other cost-saving actions in order to streamline our operations. These actions include a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 570 positions, as well as asset disposals and lease terminations. As a result of these actions, we have incurred restructuring charges of $45.5 million ($32.7 million after tax) or $0.11 per diluted share, during 2017. Actions were substantially completed in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the restructuring liability balance related to these activities was $23.2 million. The majority of the pretax charges represent net cash expenditures which are expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and will be funded from operating activities. Cash payments during 2017, related to actions initiated in 2017, were $17.8 million.

			We recorded net restructuring gains related to legacy restructuring plans that commenced prior to 2015 of $1.0 million ($0.04 million after tax) or less than $0.01 per diluted share during 2017. We recorded net restructuring gains of $9.1 million ($10.8 million after tax) or $0.04 per diluted share in 2016 and net restructuring charges of $100.3 million ($77.2 million after tax) or $0.25 per diluted share during 2015. The legacy restructuring plans liability balance was $18.3 million, $39.6 million, and $90.1 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The reduction in liability balance was driven primarily by severance and other cash payments. The remaining accrual is expected to be paid over a period of a few months to several quarters and continues to be funded from operating activities.

   Acquisition and integration related costs

			Acquisition and integration costs reported in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2017 include $13.2 million ($8.6 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share related primarily to disposal of excess inventory upon the closure of Swisher plants, accelerated rent expense, and amounts related to recognition of fair value step-up in the Anios inventory.

			Acquisition and integration costs reported in special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2017 include $15.4 million ($9.9 million after tax) or $0.03 per diluted share of acquisition costs, advisory and legal fees, and integration charges for the Anios and Swisher acquisitions during 2017.

			During 2016, we incurred acquisition and integration charges of $8.6 million ($5.4 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share primarily related to the Swisher acquisition. During 2015, as a result of the Champion acquisition and Nalco merger, we incurred charges of $18.7 million ($12.0 million after tax) or $0.05 per diluted share. The charges have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Further information related to our acquisitions is included in Note 4.

   Fixed asset impairment and other charges

			During 2017, we recorded other charges of $26.2 million ($19.7 million after tax), or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily relating to fixed asset impairments and a Global Energy vendor contract termination.

			During 2015, we recorded fixed asset impairment charge of $24.7 million ($15.4 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, consisting of certain production equipment and buildings within one of our U.S. plants. During 2016, we recorded an additional charge of $10.0 million ($6.3 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share related to the dry polymer fixed asset impairment, as well as related inventory charges. Subsequent to the charge, the remaining value of the underlying fixed assets was less than $5 million. Inventory charges include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of the corresponding dry polymer products.

   These items have been included as a component of cost of sales on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

   Inventory costs and reserve

			During 2015, we improved and standardized estimates related to our inventory reserves and product costing, resulting in a net pre-tax charge of $6.1 million. Separately, the actions resulted in a charge of $20.6 million ($15.9 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share, related to inventory reserve calculations, partially offset by a gain of $14.5 million ($12.2 million after tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory. During 2016, we took additional actions related to the capitalization of certain cost components into inventory, which resulted in a gain of $6.2 million ($4.6 million after tax), or $0.02 per diluted share.

   Energy related charges

			Oil industry activity was depressed during 2016 when compared with 2014 levels, resulting from excess oil supply pressures, which negatively impacted exploration and production investments in the energy industry, particularly in North America. As a result of these conditions and their corresponding impact on our business outlook, we recorded total charges of $76.8 million ($50.0 million after tax) or $0.17 per diluted share, comprised of inventory write-downs and related disposal costs, fixed asset charges, headcount reductions and other charges in 2016. No such charges were incurred in 2017.

			The inventory write-downs and related disposal costs of $40.5 million include adjustments due to the significant decline in activity and related prices of certain specific-use and other products, coupled with declines in replacement costs, as well as estimated costs to dispose the respective excess inventory. The fixed asset charges of $20.4 million resulted from the write-down of certain assets related to the reduction of certain aspects of our North American operations within the Global Energy segment, as well as abandonment of certain projects under construction. The carrying value of the corresponding fixed assets was reduced to zero. The employee termination costs of $13.1 million include a reduction in our Global Energy segment’s global workforce to better align its workforce with anticipated activity levels in the near term. As of the end of 2017, the remaining severance liability was minimal.

   The charges discussed above have been included as a component of both cost of sales and special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Venezuela related activities

			Effective as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated our Venezuelan subsidiaries and began accounting for the investments in our Venezuelan subsidiaries using the cost method of accounting effective in the first quarter of 2016. The conditions within Venezuela driving this decision remained in place during 2016 and 2017. Prior to deconsolidation, we remeasured our Venezuelan bolivar operations within our Water, Paper, Food & Beverage, Institutional and the bolivar portion of our Venezuelan operations within Energy operating segments from the official exchange rate at the time of 6.3 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar to the SIMADI rate at the time of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. As a result of the ownership structure of our Food & Beverage and Institutional operations in Venezuela, we reflected a portion of the devaluation impact as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Upon deconsolidation, we recorded a charge to fully write off our intercompany receivables and investment. The total charges during 2015 related to our actions in Venezuela were $289.3 million ($246.8 million after tax). We reflected $11.1 million of the above charges as a component of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Statement of Income, resulting in a net charge of $235.7 million or $0.78 per diluted share.

			We recorded gains due to U.S. dollar cash recoveries of intercompany receivables written off at the time of deconsolidation of $11.5 million ($7.2 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share and $7.8 million ($4.9 million after tax) or $0.02 per diluted share in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

   Gain on sale of business

			During 2017, we disposed of the Equipment Care business and recorded a gain of $46.1 million ($12.4 million after tax primarily due to non-deductible goodwill), or $0.04 per diluted share, net of working capital adjustments, costs to sell and other transaction expenses. The gain has been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

   Other

			We recorded net gains of $1.4 million ($0.7 million after tax), or less than $0.01 per diluted share, net charges of $33.2 million ($21.1 million after tax) or $0.07 per diluted share, and net charges of $56.3 million ($34.5 million after tax), or $0.11 per diluted share in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, primarily related to litigation related charges and settlements. In 2015, this also included the recognition of a loss on the sale of a portion of our Ecovation business, offset partially by the recovery of funds deposited into escrow as part of the Champion transaction. These items have been included as a component of special (gains) and charges on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

   Interest Expense, net

			During 2017, in anticipation of U.S. tax reform and a potential limit on interest deductibility in future years, we entered into transactions to exchange or retire certain long-term debt, and incurred debt exchange and extinguishment charges of $21.9 million ($13.6 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share. This charge has been included as a component of interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

			Our reported operating income increased 5% when comparing 2017 to 2016 and increased 23% when comparing 2016 to 2015. Our reported operating income for 2017, 2016 and 2015 was impacted by special (gains) and charges. Excluding the impact of special (gains) and charges from all three years, 2017 adjusted operating income increased 2% when compared to 2016 adjusted operating income and 2016 adjusted fixed currency operating income decreased 2% when compared to 2015 adjusted operating income.

			As shown in the previous table, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on adjusted operating income growth for 2017. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact on adjusted fixed currency operating income growth for 2016, as adjusted fixed currency operating income increased 3%.

   Interest Expense, Net

--------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- ---- ------ ------

Reported GAAP interest expense, net $255.0 $264.6 $243.6
Special (gains) and charges 21.9 - -
Non-GAAP adjusted interest expense, net $233.1 $264.6 $243.6

			Reported net interest expense totaled $255.0 million, $264.6 million and $243.6 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

			During 2017, in anticipation of U.S. tax reform and a potential limit on interest deductibility in future years, we entered into transactions to exchange or retire certain long-term debt, and incurred debt exchange and extinguishment charges of $21.9 million ($13.6 million after tax), or $0.05 per diluted share.

			The decrease in our 2017 adjusted net interest expense compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increased mix of lower cost Euro interest and lower interest rates on refinanced debt. The increase when comparing 2016 to 2015 was driven primarily by higher weighted average interest rates on outstanding debt.

   Provision for Income Taxes

   The following table provides a summary of our tax rate:

-------------------------- ----- - ---- ----- ---- ----- -
(percent) 2017 2016 2015
Reported GAAP tax rate 13.7 % 24.4 % 22.8 %
Tax rate impact of:
The Tax Act 8.8 0.0 0.0
Special gains and charges (0.1) 1.0 (0.4)
Discrete tax items 1.4 (0.2) 3.5
Non-GAAP adjusted tax rate 23.8 % 25.2 % 25.9 %

			Our reported tax rate for 2017, 2016 and 2015 includes the tax impact of special gains and charges and discrete tax items, which have impacted the comparability of our historical reported tax rates, as amounts included in our special gains and charges are derived from tax jurisdictions with rates that vary from our tax rate, and discrete tax items are not necessarily consistent across periods. The tax impact of special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items will likely continue to impact comparability of our reported tax rate in the future. The enactment of the Tax Act also significantly impacted the comparability of our reported tax rate.

			Our 2017 reported tax rate includes $160.9 million of net tax benefits associated with the Tax Act, $6.2 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net tax benefits of $25.3 million associated with discrete tax items. In connection with our analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional net discrete tax benefit of $160.9 million in the period ended December 31, 2017, which includes a $321.0 million tax benefit for recording deferred tax assets and liabilities at the U.S. enacted tax rate and a net expense for the one-time transition tax of $160.1 million. While we are able to make an estimate of the impact of the reduction in the U.S. rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to the Tax Act, including, but not limited to, estimates of assets and liabilities at future dates, our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences. In addition, federal and state tax authorities continue to issue technical guidance which may change the provisional amounts recorded in our financial statements.

			Special (gains) and charges represent the tax impact of special (gains) and charges, as well as additional tax benefits utilized in anticipation of U.S. tax reform of $7.8 million. During 2017, we also recorded a discrete tax benefit of $39.7 million related to excess tax benefits, resulting from the adoption of accounting changes regarding the treatment of tax benefits on share-based compensation. The extent of excess tax benefits is subject to variation in stock price and stock option exercises. In addition, we recorded net discrete expenses of $14.4 million related to recognizing adjustments from filing our 2016 U.S. federal income tax return and international adjustments due to changes in estimates, partially offset by the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in state tax matters.

   36

   Table of Contents

			Our 2016 reported tax rate includes $43.1 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net expenses of $3.9 million associated with discrete tax items. Our 2015 reported tax rate includes $105.7 million of net tax benefits on special gains and charges and net benefits of $63.3 million associated with discrete tax items. The net expenses related to discrete tax items in 2016 were driven primarily by recognizing adjustments from filing our 2015 U.S. federal income tax return, partially offset by settlement of international tax matters and remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the application of updated tax rates in international jurisdictions. Net expenses were also impacted by adjustments to deferred tax asset and liability positions and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations in international jurisdictions.

			Net benefits related to discrete tax items in 2015 were driven primarily by the release of $20.6 million of valuation allowances based on the realizability of foreign deferred tax assets and our ability to recognize a worthless stock deduction of $39.0 million for the tax basis in a wholly-owned domestic subsidiary.

			The change in our adjusted tax rate from 2015 to 2017 was primarily driven by global tax planning projects and geographic income mix. Future comparability of our adjusted tax rate may be impacted by various factors, including but not limited to, the Tax Act, other changes in global tax rules, further tax planning projects and geographic income mix.

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE

			The non-U.S. dollar functional international amounts included within our reportable segments are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed currency exchange rates used by management for 2017. The difference between the fixed currency exchange rates and the actual currency exchange rates is reported as “effect of foreign currency translation” in the following tables. Fixed currency amounts for 2015 also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at a SIMADI rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar. All other accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with U.S. GAAP and the accounting policies described in Note 2.

   Net Sales

			Fixed currency sales growth for Global Industrial in both 2017 and 2016 was driven by volume gains and pricing. At a regional level, the 2017 sales increase was impacted by good growth in Latin America, North America and Greater China. Regional results for 2016 were impacted by good growth in Latin America and moderate growth in Middle East/Africa (“MEA”) and Europe.

			At an operating segment level, Water fixed currency sales increased 5% in 2017 (increase of 3% acquisition adjusted). Light industry sales growth was led by innovative technology and service offerings. Fixed currency sales increased 3% in 2016, (increase of 1% acquisition adjusted) as growth in light industry sales was offset by a double digit decline in the mining industry. Food & Beverage  fixed currency sales increased 4% in 2017, benefiting from new business wins and pricing, which more than offset generally flat industry trends.

   Net Sales

			Fixed currency sales for Global Energy in 2017 had a strong growth in the well stimulation business, while the production business showed a modest decline, as growth in North America was offset by international markets. Sales in our downstream business rose moderately. In 2016, fixed currency sales for Global Energy were negatively impacted by volume reductions and lower pricing. Continued difficult operating conditions negatively impacted our well stimulation and production businesses due to lower pricing and customer product usage. Sales in our downstream business were flat in 2016. Market challenges in North America drove the reductions from a regional perspective in 2016.

   Operating Income

			Fixed currency operating income for Global Energy decreased during both 2017 and 2016 as compared to the prior year. Fixed currency operating income margins also decreased during both comparable periods. Acquisitions had a negative impact on fixed currency operating income in 2017 and minimal impact on the fixed currency operating income in 2016.  Acquisitions had a minimal impact on fixed currency operating income margins during both 2017 and 2016.

			Acquisition adjusted fixed currency operating income margins for our Global Energy segment decreased 0.4 and 2.3 percentage points in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Higher delivered product costs and business investments negatively impacted 2017 by 1.7 percentage points, partially offset by cost savings of 1.0 percentage points. Reductions in sales volume, product mix changes and lower pricing contributed approximately 5.7 percentage points to the decline in 2016, which offset the benefit of lower delivered product costs, synergies and other cost reduction actions.

   Financial Position

			Total assets were $20.0 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to total assets of $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. The increase in assets during 2017 was driven primarily by increased goodwill and intangibles as a result of the Anios and other acquisitions and the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the value of our foreign assets translated into U.S. dollars as of year end 2017.

			Total liabilities were $12.3 billion as of December 31, 2017, compared to total liabilities of $11.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. Total debt was $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2016.

Cash provided by operating activities $2,091.3 $1,939.7 $1,999.8 $151.6 $(60.1)

			We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, allowing us to fund our ongoing operations, acquisitions, investments in the business and pension obligations along with returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.

			Comparability of cash generated from operating activities across 2015 to 2017 was impacted by fluctuations in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable (“working capital”), the combination of which increased $56 million, $35 million and $119 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The cash flow impact across the three years from working capital accounts was driven by changes in sales volumes and timing of collections; timing of purchases and production and usage levels; and volume of purchases and timing of payments.

Cash used for investing activities $(1,673.2) $(829.5) $(915.8) $(843.7) $86.3

   Cash used for investing activities is primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and dispositions as well as from capital investments in the business.

			Total cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired and net of cash received from dispositions, in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $870 million, $49 million and $265 million, respectively. Our acquisitions and divestitures across 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed further in Note 4. We continue to target strategic business acquisitions which complement our growth strategy and expect to continue to make capital investments and acquisitions in the future to support our long-term growth.

			We continue to make capital investments in the business, including merchandising and customer equipment and manufacturing facilities. Total capital expenditures, including software, were $869 million, $757 million and $815 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Cash used for financing activities $(522.7) $(868.2) $(1,150.9) $345.5 $282.7

			Our cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect the issuances and repayment of debt, common stock repurchases, proceeds from common stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, dividend payments and acquisition-related contingent considerations.

			Shares are repurchased for the purpose of partially offsetting the dilutive effect of our equity compensation plans and stock issued in acquisitions, to manage our capital structure and to efficiently return capital to shareholders. We repurchased a total of $600 million, $740 million, and $755 million of shares in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts include $300 million of shares repurchased each year from 2015 through 2017 through our ASR programs. See Note 10 for further information regarding our ASR programs. Cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises provide a portion of the funding for repurchase activity.

Long-term debt repayments (799.0) (1,569.6) (1,034.7) 770.6 (534.9)

			In December 2017, we increased our indicated annual dividend rate by 11%. This represents the 26th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. We have paid dividends on our common stock for 81 consecutive years. Cash dividends declared per share of common stock, by quarter, for each of the last three years were as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

			We currently expect to fund all of our cash requirements which are reasonably foreseeable for 2018, including scheduled debt repayments, new investments in the business, share repurchases, dividend payments, possible business acquisitions and pension contributions, with cash from operating activities, and as needed, additional short-term and/or long-term borrowings. We continue to expect our operating cash flow to remain strong.

			As of December 31, 2017, we had $211 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $151 million was held outside of the U.S.

			As of December 31, 2016, we had $327 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $184 million was held outside of the U.S.

			As of December 31, 2015, we had $26 million of deferred tax liabilities for pre-acquisition foreign earnings associated with the legacy Nalco entities and legacy Champion entities that we intended to repatriate. These liabilities were recorded as part of the respective purchase price accounting of each transaction. The remaining foreign earnings were repatriated in 2016, reducing the deferred tax liabilities to zero at December 31, 2016.

			As of December 31, 2017 we had a $2.0 billion multi-year credit facility, which expires in November 2022. The credit facility has been established with a diverse syndicate of banks. There were no borrowings under our credit facility as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.

			The credit facility supports our $2.0 billion U.S. commercial paper program and $2.0 billion European commercial paper program. Combined borrowing under these two commercial paper programs may not exceed $2.0 billion. At year-end, we had no amount outstanding under the European commercial paper program and no amount outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program.

			Additionally, we have uncommitted credit lines of $660 million with major international banks and financial institutions to support our general global funding needs. Most of these lines are used to support global cash pooling structures. Approximately $643 million of these credit lines were available for use as of year-end 2017. Bank supported letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees total $198 million and represent commercial business transactions. We do not have any other significant unconditional purchase obligations or commercial commitments.

			As of December 31, 2017, our short-term borrowing program was rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s.

			As of December 31, 2017, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rated our long-term credit at A- (stable outlook) and Baa1 (stable outlook), respectively. A reduction in our credit ratings could limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs, or could also adversely affect our ability to renew existing, or negotiate new, credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of these facilities. Should this occur, we could seek additional sources of funding, including issuing additional term notes or bonds. In addition, we have the ability, at our option, to draw upon our $2.0 billion of committed credit facility.

   We are in compliance with our debt covenants and other requirements of our credit agreements and indentures.

   A schedule of our various obligations as of December 31, 2017 are summarized in the following table:

   *Interest on variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at year-end 2017.

			During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a one-time transition tax related to enactment of the Tax Act. The expense is primarily related to the one-time transition tax, which is payable over eight years. As discussed further in Note 12, this balance is a provisional amount and is subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the enactment of the Tax Act, as provided by recent SEC guidance.

			As of December 31, 2017, our gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $68 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over an extended period of time or whether a cash settlement of the liability will be required. Therefore, these amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.

   Table of Contents

			We do not have required minimum cash contribution obligations for our qualified pension plans in 2018. We are required to fund certain international pension benefit plans in accordance with local legal requirements. We estimate contributions to be made to our international plans will approximate $49 million in 2018. These amounts have been excluded from the schedule of contractual obligations.

			We lease certain sales and administrative office facilities, distribution centers, research and manufacturing facilities and other equipment under longer-term operating leases. Vehicle leases are generally shorter in duration. Vehicle leases have guaranteed residual value requirements that have historically been satisfied primarily by the proceeds on the sale of the vehicles.

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

			Other than operating leases, as discussed further in Note 13, we do not participate in off-balance sheet financing arrangements. Through the normal course of business, we have established various joint ventures that have not been consolidated within our financial statements as we are not the primary beneficiary. The joint ventures help us meet local ownership requirements, achieve quicker operational scale, expand our ability to provide customers a more fully integrated offering or provide other benefits to our business or customers. These entities have not been utilized as special purposes entities, which are sometimes established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.

   Market Risk

			We enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Our use of derivatives is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control, counterparty risk, and ongoing monitoring and reporting, and is designed to reduce the volatility associated with movements in foreign exchange and interest rates on our income statement and cash flows.

			We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany financial arrangements, and to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to cash flows denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. We use net investment hedges as hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our investments in foreign operations. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of €1,150 million senior notes designated as net investment hedges.

			We manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements. Under these arrangements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As of December 31, 2017, we had interest rate swaps outstanding with notional values of $950 million.

   See Note 8 for further information on our hedging activity.

			Based on a sensitivity analysis (assuming a 10% adverse change in market rates) of our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments, changes in exchange rates or interest rates would increase/decrease our financial position and liquidity by approximately $322 million. The effect on our results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items.

   GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT

   Energy Markets

			Approximately 23% of our sales are generated from our Global Energy segment, the results of which, as noted further below, are subject to volatility in the oil and gas commodity markets.

			During 2017, oil industry activity gradually recovered from 2016’s lows, with strong gains in North America drilling activity over the past year and related recovering capital expenditure trends. Demand for oil and overall energy consumption has shown modest growth with oil prices rising from their lows in early 2016.

			Our global footprint and broad business portfolio within the Global Energy segment, as well as our strong execution capabilities are expected to provide the required resilience to outperform in the current market. As such, we continue to remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the segment.

   Global Economies

   Approximately half of our sales are outside of the United States. Our international operations subject us to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries which could impact future operating results.

   Brexit Referendum

   On March 29, 2017, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) government gave formal notice to the European Union (“EU”) to begin the process of negotiating the U.K.’s exit (“Brexit”) from the EU. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the EU markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The negotiations might also impact various tax reliefs and

   46

   Table of Contents

exemptions that apply to transactions between the U.K. and EU. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. We will continue to monitor the status of tax law changes and tax treaty negotiations at the U.K. and EU.

			During 2017, net sales of our U.K. operations were approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales.

   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.

			Our non-GAAP financial measures for cost of sales, gross margin, interest expense and operating income exclude the impact of special (gains) and charges, and our non-GAAP measures for tax rate, net income attributable to Ecolab and diluted EPS further exclude the impact of discrete tax items. We include items within special (gains) and charges and discrete tax items that we believe can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results. After tax special (gains) and charges are derived by applying the applicable local jurisdictional tax rate to the corresponding pre-tax special (gains) and charges.

			EBITDA is defined as the sum of net income including non-controlling interest, provision for income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the sum of EBITDA and special (gains) and charges impacting EBITDA. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are used as inputs to our net debt to EBITDA and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratios. We view these ratios as important indicators of the operational and financial health of our organization.

			We evaluate the performance of our international operations based on fixed currency rates of foreign exchange. Fixed currency amounts included in this Form 10-K are based on translation into U.S. dollars at the fixed foreign currency exchange rates established by management at the beginning of 2017. Fixed currency amounts also reflect all Venezuelan bolivar operations, prior to the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, at a SIMADI rate of approximately 200 bolivares to 1 U.S. dollar, which was the approximate conversion rate for SIMADI at year end 2015.

			Acquisition adjusted growth rates exclude the results of our acquired businesses from the first twelve months post acquisition, exclude the results of our divested businesses from the twelve months prior to divestiture, and exclude the Venezuelan results of operations from both the current period and comparable period of the prior year.

			These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend that investors view these measures in conjunction with the U.S. GAAP measures included in this MD&A and we have provided reconciliations of reported U.S. GAAP amounts to the non-GAAP amounts.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes"). Our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. Both the discoun...

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our opera...

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.
