Overview
Our Business
We are a global fashion luxury group of industry-leading fashion luxury brands led by a world-class management team and renowned designers. The Michael Kors brand was launched over 35 years ago by Michael Kors, whose vision has taken the Company from its beginnings as an American luxury sportswear house to a global accessories, footwear and apparel company with a global distribution network that has presence in over 100 countries through Company-operated retail stores and e-commerce sites, leading department stores, specialty stores and select licensing partners. On November 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Jimmy Choo and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Jimmy Choo”). The combination of Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo brought together two iconic brands that are industry leaders in style and trend and created a global fashion luxury group with a diversified geographic and product portfolio, strengthening the Company’s future revenue growth opportunities.
Michael Kors is a highly recognized luxury fashion brand in the Americas and Europe with accelerating brand awareness in other international markets. The Michael Kors (“MK”) brand features distinctive designs, materials and craftsmanship with a jet-set aesthetic that combines stylish elegance and a sporty attitude. Michael Kors offers three primary collections: the Michael Kors Collection luxury line, the MICHAEL Michael Kors accessible luxury line and the Michael Kors Mens line. The Michael Kors Collection establishes the aesthetic authority of the entire brand and is carried by many of our retail stores, our e-commerce sites, as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world. MICHAEL Michael Kors has a strong focus on accessories, in addition to offering footwear and apparel, and addresses the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods. More recently, we have begun to grow our men’s business in recognition of the significant opportunity afforded by the Michael Kors brand’s established fashion authority and the expanding men’s market. Taken together, our Michael Kors collections target a broad customer base while retaining our premium luxury image.
Since its inception, Jimmy Choo has offered a distinctive, glamorous and fashion-forward product range, enabling it to develop into a leading global luxury accessories brand, whose core product offering is women’s luxury shoes, complemented by accessories, including handbags, small leather goods, scarves and belts, as well as a growing men’s luxury shoe business. In addition, certain products such as fragrances, sunglasses and eyewear are produced under product licensing agreements. Jimmy Choo’s design team is led by Sandra Choi, who has been the Creative Director for the brand since its inception in 1996. Jimmy Choo products are unique, instinctively seductive and chic. The brand offers classic and timeless luxury products, as well as innovative products that are intended to set and lead fashion trends. The Jimmy Choo brand is represented through its global store network, its e-commerce sites, as well as through the most prestigious department and specialty stores worldwide.
Prior to the third quarter of Fiscal 2018, we had three reportable segments for our Michael Kors brand: Retail, Wholesale and Licensing. With the acquisition of Jimmy Choo, the Company began to operate in four reportable segments, which are as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• MK Retail — includes sales of Michael Kors products from 379 retail stores in the Americas (including concessions) and 450 international retail stores (including concessions) in Europe and certain parts of Asia, as well as from Michael Kors e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, certain parts of Europe, China, Japan and South Korea as of March 31, 2018.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• MK Wholesale — includes wholesale sales of Michael Kors products through 1,403 department store doors and 875 specialty store doors in the Americas and through 1,048 specialty store doors and 218 department store doors internationally as of March 31, 2018. MK Wholesale also includes revenues from sales of products to Michael Kors geographic licensees.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• MK Licensing — includes royalties and advertising contributions earned on licensed products and use of the Company’s trademarks, and rights granted to third parties for the right to operate retail stores and/or sell the Company’s products in certain geographic regions.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Jimmy Choo — includes worldwide sales of Jimmy Choo products through 182 retail stores (including concessions) and Jimmy Choo e-commerce sites in the U.S., certain parts of Europe and Japan, through 629 wholesale doors, as well as through product and geographic licensing arrangements, as of March 31, 2018.

Certain Factors Affecting Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Establishing brand identity and enhancing global presence. We intend to grow our international presence through the formation of a global fashion luxury group, bringing together industry-leading fashion luxury brands. As mentioned above, on November 1, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Jimmy Choo for a total transaction value of $1.447 billion (see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information). Jimmy Choo has a rich history as a leading global luxury house, renowned for its glamorous and fashion-forward footwear, and is an excellent complement to the Michael Kors brand. We believe this combination further strengthens our future growth opportunities, while also increasing both product and geographic diversification. However, there are risks associated with a new acquisition and the anticipated benefits of the acquisition on our financial results may not be in line with our expectations.
We intend to continue to increase our international presence and global brand recognition by growing our existing international operations through acquisitions, the formation of various joint ventures with international partners, and continuing with our international licensing arrangements. We feel this is an efficient method for continued penetration into the global luxury goods market, especially for markets where we have yet to establish a substantial presence. In addition, our growth strategy includes assuming direct control of certain licensed international operations to better manage our growth opportunities in the related regions. On May 31, 2016, we acquired the previously licensed business in the Greater China region (“MKHKL”), which has operations in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our recent acquisitions.
Channel Shift and Demand for Our Accessories and Related Merchandise. Our performance is affected by trends in the luxury goods industry, as well as shifts in demographics and changes in lifestyle preferences. Although the overall consumer spending for personal luxury products has recently increased, consumer shopping preferences have continued to shift from physical stores to on-line shopping. We currently expect that this trend will continue in the foreseeable future. During Fiscal 2018, we have continued to strategically decrease promotional activity, which resulted in a reduction in shipments of Michael Kors products within our wholesale channel, which we believe is necessary to appropriately position the Michael Kors brand long-term. In addition, we have been strategically reducing promotional activity within our full-price retail stores. We continue to adjust our operating strategy to the changing business environment and on May 31, 2017, we announced that we plan to close between 100 and 125 of our Michael Kors full-price retail stores over the next two years in order to improve the profitability of our Michael Kors retail store fleet under our Retail Fleet Optimization Plan. Over this time period, we expect to incur approximately $100 - $125 million of one-time costs associated with these store closures. During Fiscal 2018, we closed 47 of our Michael Kors full-price retail stores under the Retail Fleet Optimization Plan, which resulted in restructuring charges of $52.6 million recorded within restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. We currently anticipate finalizing the remainder of the planned store closures under the Retail Fleet Optimization Plan over the next two fiscal years. Collectively, we anticipate ongoing annual savings of approximately $60 million as a result of the store closures and lower depreciation and amortization associated with the impairment charges recorded during Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018.
Foreign currency fluctuation. Our consolidated operations are impacted by the relationships between our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and those of our non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional/local currency is other than the U.S. dollar. Our Fiscal 2018 results have been positively impacted by the strengthening of the Euro and the Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar of 7% and 2%, respectively, partially offset by the declines in value of the Japanese Yen of 3%, as compared to the same prior year period. We continue to expect significant volatility in the global foreign currency exchange rates, which may have a negative impact on the reported results of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future, when translated to U.S. Dollars.
Disruptions in shipping and distribution. Our operations are subject to the impact of shipping disruptions as a result of changes or damage to our distribution infrastructure, as well as due to external factors. Any future disruptions in our shipping and distribution network could have a negative impact on our results of operations.

Costs of Manufacturing. Our industry is subject to volatility in costs related to certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products. This volatility applies primarily to costs driven by commodity prices, which can increase or decrease dramatically over a short period of time. These fluctuations may have a material impact on our revenues, results of operations and cash flows to the extent they occur. We use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate these effects by sourcing our products as efficiently as possible. In addition, manufacturing labor costs are also subject to degrees of volatility based on local and global economic conditions. We use commercially reasonable efforts to source from localities that suit our manufacturing standards and result in more favorable labor driven costs to our products.
U.S. Tax Reform. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including, among other things, lowering U.S. statutory federal tax rate and implementing a territorial tax system. As we have a March 31 fiscal year-end, the lower tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 32% for Fiscal 2018 and a 21% U.S. statutory federal tax rate for fiscal years thereafter. The Tax Act also adds many new provisions, including changes to bonus depreciation, limits on the deductions for executive compensation and interest expense, a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”), the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) and a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”). We are still evaluating the impact of these provisions of the Tax Act, which do not apply until 2019, and thus, have not adjusted any net deferred tax assets of our foreign subsidiaries for the new tax.
As part of the transition to the new territorial tax system, the Tax Act imposes a tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. statutory federal tax rate will cause us to re-measure our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740, we recorded the effects of the tax law change during Fiscal 2018, which resulted in a provisional charge of $21.2 million, comprised of an estimated deemed repatriation tax charge of $3.0 million and an estimated deferred tax charge of $18.2 million due to the re-measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax assets. Conversely, we realized a $6.1 million net benefit for Fiscal 2018 due to the corporate tax rate reductions. While the Tax Act has negatively impacted our results of operations for Fiscal 2018 by approximately 200 basis points, the lower corporate rate is expected to result in an ongoing reduction in our effective tax rate. The benefit to our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2019 is expected to be approximately 300 to 400 basis points, which we plan to reinvest in our business.
In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 118 to provide guidance for companies that would allow for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. The final transition impacts of the Tax Act may differ from the above estimate, possibly materially due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, or any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act. Our estimates are provisional and subject to adjustment in Fiscal 2019 under the measurement period allowed by the SEC. The Company expects to finalize its accounting related to the impacts of the Tax Act on the one-time transition tax liability, deferred taxes, valuation allowances, state tax considerations, and any remaining basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries during Fiscal 2019. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments during Fiscal 2019 to the provisional amounts recorded in Fiscal 2018.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition and that require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In applying such policies, we must use certain assumptions that are based upon on our informed judgments, assessments of probability and best estimates. Estimates, by their nature, are subjective and are based on analysis of available information, including current and historical factors and the experience and judgment of management. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. While our significant accounting policies are detailed in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements, our critical accounting policies are discussed below and include revenue recognition (including deferred revenue associated with our loyalty program), inventories, impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill, share-based compensation, derivatives and income taxes.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the price has been fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize retail store revenue upon sale of our products to retail consumers, net of estimated returns. Revenue from sales through our e-commerce sites is recognized at the time of delivery to the customer, reduced by an estimate of returns. Wholesale revenue is recognized net of estimates for sales returns, discounts, markdowns and allowances, after merchandise is shipped and title and risk of loss are transferred to our wholesale customers. To arrive at net sales for retail, gross sales are reduced by actual customer returns, as well as by a provision for estimated future customer returns, which is based on management’s review of historical and current customer returns. The amounts reserved for retail sales returns were $12.1 million, $7.3 million and $4.7 million at March 31, 2018, April 1, 2017 and April 2, 2016, respectively. To arrive at net sales for wholesale, gross sales are reduced by provisions for estimated future returns based on current expectations, as well as trade discounts, markdowns, allowances, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative selling expenses. Total sales reserves for wholesale were $108.6 million, $96.7 million and $110.9 million at March 31, 2018, April 1, 2017 and April 2, 2016, respectively. These estimates are based on such factors as historical trends, actual and forecasted performance, and market conditions, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. Our historical estimates of these costs were not materially different from actual results.
Royalty revenue generated from product licenses, which includes contributions for advertising, is based on reported sales of licensed products bearing our tradenames at rates specified in the license agreements. These agreements are also subject to contractual minimum levels. Royalty revenue generated by geographic licensing agreements is recognized as it is earned under the licensing agreements based on reported sales of licensees applicable to specified periods, as outlined in the agreements. These agreements allow for the use of our tradenames to sell our branded products in specific geographic regions.
During Fiscal 2018, we launched our Michael Kors customer loyalty program in the U.S., which allows customers to earn points on qualifying purchases toward monetary and non-monetary rewards that may be redeemed for purchases at our U.S. retail stores and e-commerce site. We defer a portion of the initial sales transaction based on the estimated relative fair value of the benefits using statistical formulas including the projected timing of future redemptions and historical activity. These amounts include estimated “breakage” for points that are not expected to be redeemed. The deferred revenue, net of an estimated “breakage,” is recorded as a reduction to revenue in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Our breakage and other assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value of benefits are estimates, which could vary significantly from actual benefits that will be redeemed in the future.
Inventories
Our inventory costs include amounts paid to independent manufacturers, plus duties and freight to bring the goods to the Company’s warehouses, which are located in the United States, United Kingdom, Holland, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan and United Arab Emirates. We continuously evaluate the composition of our inventory and make adjustments when the cost of inventory is not expected to be fully recoverable. The net realizable value of our inventory is estimated based on historical experience, current and forecasted demand and market conditions. In addition, reserves for inventory losses are estimated based on historical experience and inventory counts. Our inventory reserves are estimates, which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions, customer demand or competition differ from expectations. Our historical estimates of these adjustments have not differed materially from actual results.
Long-lived Assets
We evaluate all long-lived assets, including fixed assets and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. For the purposes of impairment testing, we group our long-lived assets according to their lowest level of use, such as aggregating and capitalizing all construction costs related to a retail store into leasehold improvements and those related to our wholesale business into shop-in-shops. Our leasehold improvements are typically amortized over the life of the store lease, including highly probable renewals, and our shop-in-shops are amortized over a useful life of three or four years. Our impairment testing is based on our best estimate of the future operating cash flows. If the sum of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset is less than the asset’s carrying value, we recognize an impairment charge, which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. These estimates of future cash flows require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future volume, sales and expense growth rates, devaluation and inflation. As such, these estimates may differ from actual cash flows and future impairments may result if actual cash flows are lower than our expectations. During Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $32.7 million, $199.2 million and $10.9 million, respectively, primarily related to fixed assets and lease rights for underperforming Michael Kors retail stores. Please refer to Note 6, Note 7 and Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated audited financial statements for additional information.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets
We record intangible assets based on their fair value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired. The brand intangible asset recorded in connection with the Jimmy Choo acquisition was determined to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset, which is not subject to amortization. We perform an impairment assessment of goodwill and the Jimmy Choo brand intangible asset on an annual basis, or whenever impairment indicators exist. In the absence of any impairment indicators, goodwill and the Jimmy Choo brand are assessed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business.
We may assess our goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment initially using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is greater than their carrying value. When performing a qualitative test, we assess various factors including industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions and performance of our businesses. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired, a quantitative impairment analysis would be performed to determine if impairment is required. We may also elect to perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible asset initially rather than using a qualitative approach.
The impairment testing for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The valuation methods used in the quantitative fair value assessment, discounted cash flow and market multiples method, require our management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of our reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the related carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further testing is performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference. The valuation of goodwill is affected by, among other things, our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist, and, therefore, that goodwill may be impaired.
If we elect to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible asset, the fair value of the Jimmy Choo brand is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the "relief from royalty" method, assuming that a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in lieu of ownership for this intangible asset. This approach is dependent on many factors, including estimates of future growth, royalty rates, and discount rates. Actual future results may differ from these estimates. Impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the Jimmy Choo brand intangible assets is less than its carrying amount.
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018, we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis for our Michael Kors brand using a quantitative approach, using the discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. Based on the results of these assessments, we concluded that the fair values of the Michael Kors reporting units significantly exceeded the related carrying amounts and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment. The impairment analyses relating to the Jimmy Choo goodwill and brand were performed using a qualitative approach due to the proximity to the acquisition date and it was concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill and brand exceeded their respective carrying values and, therefore, did not result in impairment. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited financial statements for information relating to our annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018. There were no impairment charges related to goodwill in any of the fiscal periods presented.
Share-based Compensation
We grant share-based awards to certain of our employees and directors. The grant date fair value of share options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires us to use subjective assumptions. The closing market price at the grant date is used to determine the grant date fair value of restricted shares, restricted share units, and performance restricted share units. These values are recognized as expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, based on expected attainment of pre-established performance goals for performance grants, or the passage of time for those grants which have only time-based vesting requirements.
Beginning in Fiscal 2018, we began using our own historical experience in determining the expected holding period and volatility of our time-based share option awards. In prior periods, we used the simplified method for determining the expected life of our options and average volatility rates of similar actively traded companies over the estimated holding period, due to insufficient historical option exercise experience as a public company. Determining the grant date fair value of share-based awards requires considerable judgment, including estimating expected volatility, expected term, risk-free rate, and forfeitures. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, the fair value of future awards and resulting share-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have estimated in the past.

Derivative Financial Instruments
We use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain of our transactions. We are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of our purchasing subsidiaries’ local currency relative to the currency requirement of the supplier on the date of the commitment. As such, we enter into forward currency contracts that generally mature in 12 months or less, which is consistent with the related purchase commitments. We designate certain contracts related to the purchase of inventory that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges. All of our derivative instruments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a gross basis, regardless of their hedge designation. The effective portion of changes in the fair value for contracts designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item effects earnings. When the inventory related to forecasted inventory purchases that are being hedged is sold to a third party, the gains or losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized within cost of goods sold. We use regression analysis to assess effectiveness of derivative instruments that are designated as hedges, which compares the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument to the change in the related hedged item. Effectiveness is assessed on a quarterly basis and any portion of the designated hedge contracts deemed ineffective is recorded to foreign currency gain (loss). If the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in the future, future changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings. For those contracts that are not designated as hedges, changes in the fair value are recorded in foreign currency gain (loss) in our consolidated statements of operations.
The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. In order to mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other financial factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure.
Income Taxes
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities and are determined using the tax rates and laws in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse. We periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities, based on the results of local, state, federal or foreign statutory tax audits or our own estimates and judgments.
Realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration in the applicable tax jurisdiction. We periodically review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances as deemed necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that more-likely-than-not will be realized. This determination involves considerable judgment and our management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including recent earnings results within various taxing jurisdictions, expectations of future taxable income, the carryforward periods remaining and other factors. Changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in income in the period such determination is made. Deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable.
We recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax returns at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. The effect of an uncertain income tax position will not be taken into account if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Our tax positions are analyzed periodically (at least quarterly) and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments for those positions. We record interest expense and penalties payable to relevant tax authorities as income tax expense.

MK Wholesale
We sell Michael Kors products directly to department stores, primarily located across the Americas and Europe to accommodate consumers who prefer to shop at major department stores. In addition, we sell to specialty stores for those consumers who enjoy the boutique experience afforded by such stores, as well as to travel retail shops, in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We also have wholesale arrangements pursuant to which we sell Michael Kors products to our geographic licensees in certain parts of EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia, as well as in Brazil. We continue to focus our sales efforts and drive sales in existing locations by enhancing presentation with our specialized fixtures that effectively communicate our brand and create a more personalized shopping experience for consumers. We tailor our assortments through wholesale product planning and allocation processes to better match the demands of our department store customers in each local market.

MK Licensing
We generate licensing revenue for our Michael Kors brand through product and geographic licensing arrangements. Our product license agreements allow third parties to use the Michael Kors brand name and trademarks in connection with the manufacturing and sale of a variety of products, including watches, jewelry, fragrances and beauty, and eyewear. In product licensing arrangements, we take an active role in the design, marketing and distribution of products under the Michael Kors brand. Our geographic licensing arrangements allow third parties to use our Michael Kors tradenames in connection with the retail and/or wholesale sales of our Michael Kors branded products in specific geographic regions, such as Brazil, the Middle East, South Africa, Eastern Europe, certain parts of Asia and Australia. We acquired direct control of our licensed operations in the Greater China region on May 31, 2016. The results of the acquired business are now being reported as part of our MK Retail and MK Wholesale operations. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, the Company licensed the right to operate retail stores bearing the Michael Kors trademark to a third party in Brazil.
Jimmy Choo
The Jimmy Choo business was acquired and consolidated by the Company beginning on November 1, 2017. We generate revenue through the sale of Jimmy Choo luxury goods to end clients through directly operated Jimmy Choo stores throughout North America (United States and Canada), EMEA and certain parts of Asia, through our e-commerce sites, as well as through wholesale sales of luxury goods to distribution partners (including geographic licensing arrangements that allow third parties to use the Jimmy Choo tradenames in connection with retail and/or wholesale sales of Jimmy Choo branded products in specific geographic regions), multi-brand department stores and specialty stores worldwide. In addition, revenue is generated through product licensing agreements, which allow third parties to use the Jimmy Choo brand name and trademarks in connection with the manufacturing and sale of fragrances, sunglasses and eyewear, as well as through geographic licensing arrangements, which allow third parties to use the Jimmy Choo tradenames in connections with the retail and/or wholesale sales of our Jimmy Choo branded products in specific geographic regions.

General Definitions for Operating Results
Total revenue consists of sales from comparable retail stores and e-commerce sites and non-comparable retail stores and e-commerce sites, net of returns and markdowns, as well as those made to our wholesale customers, net of returns, discounts, markdowns and allowances. Additionally, revenue includes royalties and other contributions earned on sales of licensed products by our licensees as well as contractual royalty rates for the use of our trademarks in certain geographic territories.
Comparable store net sales include sales from a retail store or an e-commerce site that has been operating for one full year after the end of the first month of its operation under our ownership. For stores that are closed, sales that were made in the final month of their operations (assuming closure prior to the fiscal month’s end), are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Additionally, sales for stores that are either relocated, or expanded by a square footage of 25% or greater, in any given fiscal year, are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales at the time of their move or interruption, until such stores have been in their new location, or are operating under their new size/capacity, for at least one full year after the end of the first month of their relocation or expansion. All comparable store sales are presented on a 52-week basis. Comparable store sales are reported on a global basis, which represents management’s view of our Company as an expanding global business.
Constant currency effects are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, which are provided to supplement our reported operating results to facilitate comparisons of our operating results and trends in our business, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Because we are a global company, foreign currency exchange rates may have a significant effect on our reported results. We calculate constant currency measures and the related foreign currency impacts by translating the current-year’s reported amounts into comparable amounts using prior year’s foreign exchange rates for each currency. All constant currency performance measures discussed below should be considered a supplement to and not in lieu of our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory sold, freight-in on merchandise and foreign currency exchange gains/losses related to designated forward contracts for purchase commitments. All retail operating and occupancy costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses (see below) and, as a result, our cost of goods sold may not be comparable to that of other entities that have chosen to include some or all of those expenses as a component of their cost of goods sold.
Gross profit is total revenue minus cost of goods sold. As a result of retail operating and occupancy costs being excluded from our cost of goods sold, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities that have chosen to include some or all of those expenses as a component of their gross profit.

Table of Contents

Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of warehousing and distribution costs, rent for our distribution centers, payroll, store occupancy costs (such as rent, common area maintenance, store pre-opening, real estate taxes and utilities), information technology and systems costs, corporate payroll and related benefits, advertising and promotion expense and other general expenses.
Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation and amortization of fixed and definite-lived intangible assets.
Impairment consists of charges to write-down fixed assets and definite-lived intangible assets to fair value.
Restructuring and other charges includes store closure costs recorded in connection with the Retail Fleet Optimization Plan, as well as transaction and transition costs recorded in connection with our acquisitions of the Jimmy Choo and MKHKL businesses (please refer to Note 3 and Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information).
Income from operations consists of gross profit minus total operating expenses.
Other (income) expense, net includes insurance settlements, proceeds received related to our anti-counterfeiting efforts and rental income from our owned distribution center in Europe. In future periods, it may include any other miscellaneous activities not directly related to our operations.
Interest expense, net represents interest and fees on our revolving credit facilities, senior notes, term loan facilities and letters of credit (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further detail on our credit facilities), as well as amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount, offset by interest earned on highly liquid investments (investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less, classified as cash equivalents).
Foreign currency (gain)/loss includes net gains or losses related to the mark-to-market (fair value) on our forward currency contracts not designated as accounting hedges and unrealized income or loss from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries.
Noncontrolling interests represents the portion of the equity ownership in the Michael Kors Latin American joint venture, MK (Panama) Holdings, S.A. and subsidiaries (“MK Panama”). During the three months ended July 1, 2017, we repurchased a portion of the non-controlling interest in MK Panama for approximately $0.5 million and have a 75% ownership interest in MK Panama. In addition, on November 1, 2017 we acquired Jimmy Choo, which has controlling financial interests in the Jimmy Choo Middle East Joint Venture, JC Industry S.r.L (“JCI”), and JC Gulf Trading LLC (“JC Gulf”). As such, noncontrolling interest includes the portion of the equity ownership in JCI and JC Gulf, which is not attributable to our Company.

Total Revenue
Total revenue increased $224.9 million, or 5.0%, to $4.719 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, compared to $4.494 billion for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017, which included net favorable foreign currency effects of $64.3 million primarily related to the strengthening of the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi and the Canadian Dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar in Fiscal 2018, as compared to Fiscal 2017. On a constant currency basis, our total revenue increased $160.6 million, or 3.6%. Total revenue for Fiscal 2018 included approximately $222.6 million of incremental revenue attributable to Jimmy Choo, which was acquired and consolidated into the Company’s results of operations effective November 1, 2017. The increase in revenue from our Michael Kors retail business was largely offset by the decrease in Michael Kors wholesale revenue, as further described below.

MK Retail
Revenue from our Michael Kors retail stores increased $139.7 million, or 5.4%, to $2.712 billion for Fiscal 2018, compared to $2.572 billion for Fiscal 2017, which included net favorable foreign currency effects of $38.9 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue from our retail stores increased $100.8 million, or 3.9%. We operated 829 Michael Kors retail stores, including concessions, as of March 31, 2018, compared to 827 retail stores, including concessions, as of April 1, 2017.
Our comparable store sales decreased $50.2 million, or 2.2%, during Fiscal 2018, which included net favorable foreign currency effects of $35.2 million. Our comparable store sales benefited approximately 230 basis points from the inclusion of e-commerce sales in comparable store sales. On a constant currency basis, our comparable store sales decreased $85.4 million, or 3.7%. The decrease in our comparable store sales was primarily attributable to lower sales from our women’s accessories, watches and jewelry product categories, offset in part by higher sales from men’s accessories, women’s apparel and footwear during Fiscal 2018 compared to Fiscal 2017.
Our non-comparable store sales increased $189.9 million during Fiscal 2018, which included net favorable foreign currency effects of $3.7 million. On a constant currency basis, non-comparable store sales increased $186.2 million. The increase in non-comparable store sales was primarily attributable to the growth of our Michael Kors retail store network (net of store closures) and e-commerce operations since April 1, 2017. Our Greater China business acquired on May 31, 2016 contributed incremental revenues of approximately $42.0 million to non-comparable store sales for Fiscal 2018.
MK Wholesale
Revenue from our Michael Kors wholesale customers decreased $136.5 million, or 7.7%, to $1.639 billion for Fiscal 2018, compared to $1.776 billion for Fiscal 2017, which included net favorable foreign currency effects of approximately $25.4 million. On a constant currency basis, our wholesale revenue decreased $161.9 million, or 9.1%. The decrease in our wholesale revenue was primarily attributable to our strategic decrease in promotional activity, which resulted in a reduction in shipments of Michael Kors products within our wholesale channel, as previously described, which resulted in lower women’s accessories sales, offset in part by higher sales from men’s and women’s apparel product lines during Fiscal 2018 as compared to Fiscal 2017. Approximately $7.9 million of the decrease in wholesale revenue was due to the absence of the prior period wholesale sales to our former licensee in Greater China.
MK Licensing
Royalties earned on our Michael Kors licensing agreements decreased $0.9 million, or 0.6%, to $144.9 million for Fiscal 2018, compared to $145.8 million for Fiscal 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to the absence of licensing revenues from our business in Greater China due to our acquisition of the related operations, lower licensing revenues related to the sales of fashion watches, jewelry and fragrances, largely offset by higher licensing royalties related to sales of Michael Kors ACCESS smartwatches and eyewear.
Jimmy Choo
The Jimmy Choo business acquired on November 1, 2017 contributed approximately $222.6 million to our total revenue for Fiscal 2018.

Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $197.9 million, or 7.4%, to $2.859 billion during Fiscal 2018, compared to $2.661 billion for Fiscal 2017, which included net favorable foreign currency effects of $40.0 million. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased 140 basis points to 60.6% during Fiscal 2018, compared to 59.2% during Fiscal 2017. Our gross margin benefited 20 basis points from the inclusion of Jimmy Choo from the November 1, 2017 acquisition date to March 31, 2018. The increase in our gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a favorable channel mix due to a higher proportion of Michael Kors retail sales, as well as an increase in gross profit margin from our MK Retail segment of 160 basis points, primarily driven by favorable geographic mix of sales, lower cost of goods and decreased promotional activity. The increase in gross profit margin was partially offset by a decrease of 90 basis points in our MK Wholesale segment gross margin, primarily driven by unfavorable product mix and increased markdowns, partially offset by lower costs of goods during Fiscal 2018, as compared to Fiscal 2017.
Total Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses increased $138.7 million, or 7.0%, to $2.110 billion during Fiscal 2018, compared to $1.972 billion for Fiscal 2017. Our operating expenses included a net unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $37.7 million. Total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 44.7% in Fiscal 2018, compared to 43.9% in Fiscal 2017. The components that comprise total operating expenses are detailed below.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $225.6 million, or 14.6%, to $1.767 billion during Fiscal 2018, compared to $1.541 billion for Fiscal 2017, including a net unfavorable foreign currency impact of $32.4 million. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• incremental costs of $134.6 million associated with our newly acquired Jimmy Choo business, which has been consolidated into our operations beginning on November 1, 2017;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $47.9 million in retail store and overhead costs (excluding newly acquired businesses), primarily comprised of increased occupancy costs of $25.6 million, advertising costs of $13.2 million and compensation-related costs of $7.3 million;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• incremental expenses of approximately $22.3 million due to the inclusion of the Greater China business acquired on May 31, 2016 for the full year in Fiscal 2018; and

- ---------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $31.8 million in corporate expenses.

These increases were partially offset by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower deferred rent of $15.8 million in connection with store closures under our Retail Fleet Optimization Plan.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 37.4% during Fiscal 2018, compared to 34.3% for Fiscal 2017, primarily due to expenses associated with the newly acquired Jimmy Choo business.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization decreased $11.2 million, or 5.1%, to $208.6 million during Fiscal 2018, compared to $219.8 million for Fiscal 2017. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily attributable to lower depreciation due to fixed asset impairment charges recorded in Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018. The depreciation and amortization expense for Fiscal 2018 included incremental depreciation and amortization of $13.3 million related to the newly acquired Jimmy Choo business, as well as $5.7 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expenses due to the inclusion of the Greater China business for the full period in Fiscal 2018, both including amortization of the respective purchase accounting adjustments. Depreciation and amortization decreased to 4.4% as a percentage of total revenue during Fiscal 2018, compared to 4.9% for Fiscal 2017.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
During Fiscal 2018, we recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of $32.7 million, $31.3 million of which related to underperforming Michael Kors full-price retail store locations, some of which we plan to close as part of the Company’s previously announced Retail Fleet Optimization Plan and $1.4 million related to wholesale operations. During Fiscal 2017, we recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of approximately $199.2 million, $198.7 million of which related to fixed assets and lease rights for underperforming Michael Kors retail store locations and $0.5 million related to our Michael Kors wholesale locations. Please refer to Note 12 and Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Restructuring and Other Charges
During Fiscal 2018, we recognized restructuring and other charges of $102.1 million, which were comprised of $40.6 million of transaction costs and $8.9 million of transition costs recorded in connection with the Jimmy Choo acquisition, as well as restructuring charges of $52.6 million recorded in connection with our Michael Kors brand Retail Fleet Optimization Plan (see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information). During Fiscal 2017, we recorded $11.3 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of the Greater China business.
Income from Operations
As a result of the foregoing, income from operations increased $59.2 million, or 8.6%, to $749.1 million during Fiscal 2018, compared to $689.9 million for Fiscal 2017, which included net favorable foreign currency effects of $2.3 million. Income from operations as a percentage of total revenue increased to 15.9% in Fiscal 2018, compared to 15.4% in Fiscal 2017.

MK Retail
Income from operations for our MK Retail segment increased $174.0 million, or 108.9%, to $333.8 million during Fiscal 2018, compared to $159.8 million for Fiscal 2017. Income from operations for Fiscal 2018 included restructuring charges of $52.6 million and impairment charges of $31.3 million relating to underperforming Michael Kors retail store locations and store closures in connection with our previously mentioned Retail Fleet Optimization Plan. Income from operations for Fiscal 2017 included $198.7 million of impairment charges related to underperforming retail stores. Income from operations as a percentage of retail revenue increased 610 basis points from 6.2% in Fiscal 2017 to 12.3% during Fiscal 2018. The increase in income from operations as a percentage of retail revenue was attributable to lower operating expenses of 450 basis points and a 160 basis point improvement in gross profit margin, as previously discussed. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was largely due to a 440 basis point year-over-year decrease in impairment and restructuring charges, as mentioned above, as well as lower depreciation expenses, offset in part by allocated transaction and transition costs in connection with the Jimmy Choo acquisition and an increase in retail store related costs.
MK Wholesale
Income from operations for our wholesale segment decreased $94.3 million, or 20.1%, to $373.8 million during Fiscal 2018, compared to $468.1 million for Fiscal 2017. Income from operations as a percentage of wholesale revenue decreased approximately 360 basis points from 26.4% during Fiscal 2017 to 22.8% during Fiscal 2018, which was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of wholesale revenue of approximately 270 basis points, as well as a 90 basis point decrease in our wholesale gross profit margin, as previously discussed. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of wholesale revenue was primarily attributable to a deleverage in other operating expenses due to lower wholesale revenue, as well as increased corporate allocated expenses, including transaction and transition costs associated with the Jimmy Choo acquisition.

Table of Contents

MK Licensing
Income from operations for our licensing segment decreased $3.8 million, or 6.1%, to $58.2 million during Fiscal 2018, compared to $62.0 million for Fiscal 2017. Income from operations as a percentage of licensing revenue declined approximately 230 basis points from 42.5% during Fiscal 2017 to 40.2% during Fiscal 2018. The decrease in licensing income from operations as a percentage of licensing revenue was attributable to increased operating expenses as a percentage of licensing revenue during Fiscal 2018, as compared to Fiscal 2017, primarily due to increased corporate allocated expenses, including transaction and transition costs associated with the Jimmy Choo acquisition, partially offset by lower advertising costs as a percentage of licensing revenue.
Jimmy Choo
During the period from the November 1, 2017 acquisition date to March 31, 2018, we recorded a net loss from operations for Jimmy Choo of $16.7 million (after amortization of non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and transaction and transition related costs).
Other Income, net
Other income of $1.7 million during Fiscal 2018 was primarily related to rental income from our owned distribution center in Europe. Other income of $5.4 million during Fiscal 2017 was primarily comprised of a $3.8 million in insurance settlements related to the prior-year disruption to our former third-party operated e-commerce fulfillment center, $0.9 million in income related to our anti-counterfeiting efforts and $0.7 million of rental income from our owned distribution center in Europe.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net increased $18.2 million to $22.3 million for Fiscal 2018, as compared to $4.1 million for Fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher interest expense on long-term borrowings used to finance the acquisition of Jimmy Choo during Fiscal 2018 (see Note 10 for additional information).
Foreign Currency (Gain) Loss
We recognized a net foreign currency gain of $13.3 million during Fiscal 2018, which included net gains on revaluation and settlement of certain of our accounts payable in currencies other than the functional currency of the applicable reporting units, and the remeasurement of dollar-denominated intercompany loans with certain of our subsidiaries, as well as a net gain of $3.4 million related to the change in fair value of undesignated forward foreign currency exchange contracts, primarily comprised of a $4.7 million realized gain related to a forward foreign currency exchange derivative contract to hedge the transaction price of the Jimmy Choo acquisition (please refer to Note 3 and Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information).
The foreign currency loss of $2.6 million recorded during Fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to net losses on the revaluation and settlement of certain of our accounts payable in currencies other than the functional currency of the applicable reporting units, as well as the remeasurement of dollar-denominated intercompany loans with certain of our subsidiaries. The net foreign currency loss for Fiscal 2017 also included favorable mark-to-market adjustment of $2.6 million related to our forward foreign currency contracts not designated as accounting hedges.
Provision for Income Taxes
We recognized $149.7 million of income tax expense during Fiscal 2018, compared with $137.1 million for Fiscal 2017. Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2018 was 20.2%, compared to 19.9% for Fiscal 2017. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the the re-measurement of uncertain U.S. state and foreign tax positions and the unfavorable effects of U.S. tax reform. These increases were partially offset by an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions, primarily in Europe.
Our effective tax rate may fluctuate from time to time due to the effects of changes in U.S. state and local taxes and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, factors such as the geographic mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation and the results of various global tax strategies, may also impact our effective tax rate in future periods.
Net Income Attributable to MKHL
As a result of the foregoing, our net income attributable to MKHL increased $39.4 million, or 7.1%, to $591.9 million during Fiscal 2018, compared to $552.5 million for Fiscal 2017.

Total Revenue
Total revenue decreased $218.4 million, or 4.6%, to $4.494 billion for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017, compared to $4.712 billion for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2016, which included net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $11.7 million primarily related to the weakening of the British Pound and the Euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar in Fiscal 2017, as compared to Fiscal 2016. On a constant currency basis, our total revenue decreased by $206.7 million, or 4.4%. The decrease in our total revenue was primarily attributable to lower Michael Kors wholesale and licensing revenues, partially offset by increased revenue from our Michael Kors retail business. Total revenue in Fiscal 2017 included approximately $168.3 million of incremental revenue attributable to our recent acquisitions, including $151.1 million related to our acquisition of the Greater China operations on May 31, 2016 and incremental revenues of $4.0 million and $13.2 million, respectively, resulting from our consolidation of MK Panama and acquisition of MK Korea in Fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2016 included approximately $33.7 million of incremental retail revenue attributable to the inclusion of the 53rd week.

MK Retail
Revenue from our Michael Kors retail stores increased $177.2 million, or 7.4%, to $2.572 billion for Fiscal 2017, compared to $2.395 billion for Fiscal 2016, which included unfavorable foreign currency effects of $8.7 million. On a constant currency basis, revenue from our Michael Kors retail stores increased $185.9 million, or 7.8%. We operated 827 Michael Kors retail stores, including concessions, as of April 1, 2017, compared to 668 Michael Kors retail stores, including concessions, as of April 2, 2016.
Our comparable store sales decreased $172.7 million, or 8.3%, during Fiscal 2017, which included net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $3.9 million. Our comparable store sales benefited approximately 304 basis points from the inclusion of the North American e-commerce sales in comparable store sales. On a constant currency basis, our comparable store sales decreased $168.8 million, or 8.1%. The decrease in our comparable store sales was primarily attributable to lower sales from our women’s accessories, watches and jewelry product categories during Fiscal 2017 compared to Fiscal 2016.
Our non-comparable store sales increased $349.9 million during Fiscal 2017, which included net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $4.8 million. On a constant currency basis, our non-comparable store sales increased $354.7 million. The increase in non-comparable store sales was primarily attributable to operating 159 additional stores since April 2, 2016, including 111 stores associated with our acquisition of the previously licensed operations in Greater China. Our recently acquired and consolidated businesses contributed approximately $226.9 million to our non-comparable store sales for Fiscal 2017, $206.7 million of which related to Greater China, $15.1 million to South Korea and $5.1 million to Latin America. Fiscal 2016 included approximately $33.7 million of incremental retail revenue attributable to the inclusion of the 53rd week.
MK Wholesale
Revenue from our Michael Kors wholesale customers decreased $368.1 million, or 17.2%, to $1.776 billion for Fiscal 2017, compared to $2.144 billion for Fiscal 2016, which included unfavorable foreign currency effects of $3.0 million. On a constant currency basis, our Michael Kors wholesale revenue decreased $365.1 million, or 17.0%. The decrease in our Michael Kors wholesale revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales from our women’s accessories, apparel and footwear product lines, offset in part by increased men’s sales during Fiscal 2017 as compared to Fiscal 2016. Approximately $51.2 million of the decrease in Michael Kors wholesale revenue was due to the absence of the prior period wholesale sales to our licensees in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America as a result of our acquisition and consolidation of the related businesses.
MK Licensing
Royalties earned on our licensing agreements decreased $27.5 million, or 15.9%, to $145.8 million for Fiscal 2017, compared to $173.3 million for Fiscal 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower licensing revenues related to watches and lower revenues from our geographic licensing arrangements in Asia due to our recent acquisitions of the related licensed operations, as well as a decrease in licensing revenues related to jewelry. These decreases were partially offset by higher licensing revenues related to sales of outerwear.
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased $135.8 million, or 4.9%, to $2.661 billion during Fiscal 2017, compared to $2.797 billion for Fiscal 2016, which included unfavorable foreign currency effects of $2.0 million. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue declined 20 basis points to 59.2% during Fiscal 2017, compared to 59.4% during Fiscal 2016. The slight decrease in our gross profit margin was primarily driven by a 250 basis point decline in our MK Retail segment gross margin, primarily attributable to increased promotional activity, which was largely offset by a favorable channel mix due to a higher proportion of retail sales than in the prior fiscal period, as well a 50 basis point improvement in our MK Wholesale segment gross margin, primarily reflecting lower allowances during Fiscal 2017, as compared to Fiscal 2016.

Total Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses increased $349.4 million, or 21.5%, to $1.972 billion during Fiscal 2017, compared to $1.622 billion for Fiscal 2016. Our operating expenses included a net favorable foreign currency impact of approximately $5.4 million. Total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 43.9% in Fiscal 2017, compared to 34.4% in Fiscal 2016. The components that comprise total operating expenses are detailed below.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $113.2 million, or 7.9%, to $1.541 billion during Fiscal 2017, compared to $1.428 billion for Fiscal 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $129.9 million due to the inclusion of the recently acquired businesses in the Greater China and South Korea regions in our operating results during Fiscal 2017; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase of $31.4 million in retail store occupancy costs, excluding expenses related to acquired businesses, primarily attributable to the growth in our retail store network and our global e-commerce business.

These increases were partially offset in part by:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $29.9 million in corporate expenses, excluding transaction costs and expenses related to acquired businesses;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease of $12.7 million in selling expenses, excluding acquired businesses; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower retail compensation-related expenses of $11.3 million primarily as a result of our cost reduction initiatives.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to 34.3% during Fiscal 2017, compared to 30.3% for Fiscal 2016. The increase as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to the increase in our retail store-related costs as a percentage of revenue during Fiscal 2017, as compared to Fiscal 2016.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased $36.6 million, or 20.0%, to $219.8 million during Fiscal 2017, compared to $183.2 million for Fiscal 2016. Approximately $31.1 million of this increase was attributable to depreciation and amortization expenses recorded for our newly acquired and consolidated businesses in Greater China, South Korea and Latin America, including amortization of the reacquired rights intangible asset recognized in connection with the acquisition of the Greater China business. The remainder of the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to an increase in build-out of our new Michael Kors retail stores and shop-in-shop locations, and investments in our corporate facilities and our information systems infrastructure. Depreciation and amortization increased to 4.9% as a percentage of total revenue during Fiscal 2017, compared to 3.9% for Fiscal 2016.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
During Fiscal 2017, we recognized asset impairment charges of approximately $199.2 million, $198.7 million of which related to fixed assets and lease rights for underperforming Michael Kors retail store locations that are still in operation and $0.5 million related to our Michael Kors wholesale operations. During Fiscal 2016, fixed asset impairment charges of $10.9 million, $8.6 million of which related to Michael Kors retail locations that are still in operation, $0.4 million related to our Michael Kors wholesale operations and $1.9 million related to a corporate fixed asset that is no longer in service. Please refer to Note 11 and Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Restructuring and Other Charges
 During Fiscal 2017, we recorded $11.3 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of the Greater China business, which were previously recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses and reclassified to restructuring and other charges to conform to Fiscal 2018 presentation.

Income from Operations
As a result of the foregoing, income from operations decreased $485.2 million, or 41.3%, to $689.9 million during Fiscal 2017, compared to $1.175 billion for Fiscal 2016, which included net favorable foreign currency effects of $3.4 million. Income from operations as a percentage of total revenue declined to 15.4% in Fiscal 2017, compared to 24.9% in Fiscal 2016.
The following table details income from operations for our three business segments (dollars in millions):

----------------------- ------------------ ----- ------------- ----- -------- ------- --------------------------------- - --------------------------------- ------ -- ----- -- ---- - ---- -

 Fiscal Years Ended $ Change % Change % of Total Revenue forFiscal 2017 % of Total Revenue forFiscal 2016
 April 1, 2017 April 2, 2016
Income from operations:
MK Retail $ 159.8 $ 501.4 $ (341.6 ) (68.1 )% 6.2 % 20.9 %
MK Wholesale 468.1 584.1 (116.0 ) (19.9 )% 26.4 % 27.2 %

Income from operations $ 689.9 $ 1,175.1 $ (485.2 ) (41.3 )% 15.4 % 24.9 %

MK Retail
Income from operations for our MK Retail segment declined $341.6 million, or 68.1%, to $159.8 million during Fiscal 2017, compared to $501.4 million for Fiscal 2016, which included impairment charges relating to underperforming Michael Kors retail stores of $198.7 million and $8.6 million, respectively. Income from operations as a percentage of net retail sales for the MK Retail segment declined from 20.9% in Fiscal 2016 to 6.2% during Fiscal 2017. Approximately 740 basis points of this decline was attributable to the above mentioned impairment charges. The remaining 730 basis point decrease in retail income from operations as a percentage of net retail sales was primarily due to an increase in other operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales of approximately 480 basis points, as well as a 250 basis point decrease in gross profit margin, as previously discussed, during Fiscal 2017 as compared to Fiscal 2016. The increase in total retail operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales was largely due to the following: (i) the above-mentioned impairment charges for underperforming Michael Kors retail stores still in operation; (ii) increased retail store-related costs; (iii) higher depreciation expenses associated with the recently acquired businesses and new store openings; (iv) increased corporate allocated expenses primarily due to the inclusion of transaction costs of $11.3 million related to the acquisition of the Greater China business; and (v) amortization of the reacquired rights intangible asset recognized in connection with our acquisition of the Greater China business.
MK Wholesale
Income from operations for our MK Wholesale segment declined $116.0 million, or 19.9%, to $468.1 million during Fiscal 2017, compared to $584.1 million for Fiscal 2016. Income from operations as a percentage of net wholesale sales decreased approximately 80 basis points to 26.4%. The decrease in wholesale income from operations as a percentage of wholesale net sales was primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of net wholesale sales of approximately 130 basis points, partially offset by a 50 basis point increase in our wholesale gross profit margin, as previously discussed. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of wholesale sales was primarily attributable to increased distribution, selling and design costs, as well as higher depreciation expenses in Fiscal 2017, partially offset by the absence of prior year write-off related to fixed assets.
MK Licensing
Income from operations for our MK Licensing segment decreased $27.6 million, or 30.8%, to $62.0 million during Fiscal 2017, compared to $89.6 million for Fiscal 2016. Income from operations as a percentage of licensing revenue declined approximately 920 basis points to 42.5%. The decline in licensing income from operations as a percentage of licensing revenue was due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of licensing revenues during Fiscal 2017, as compared to Fiscal 2016. This increase in operating expenses as a percentage of licensing revenue was primarily due to increased advertising expenses, depreciation expenses and corporate allocated expenses, including costs related to protection of our intellectual property, during Fiscal 2017 as compared to Fiscal 2016.

Table of Contents

Other Income, net
Other income of $5.4 million during Fiscal 2017 was primarily comprised of $3.8 million in insurance settlements related to the prior-year disruption to our former third party operated e-commerce fulfillment center, $0.9 million of income related to our anti-counterfeiting efforts and $0.7 million of rental income from our owned distribution center in Europe. During Fiscal 2016, other income of $3.7 million was primarily comprised of a $3.7 million gain on acquisition of MK Korea (see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and $1.0 million in income related to our anti-counterfeiting efforts, partially offset by $1.0 million of losses related to our joint venture, which were recorded under the equity method of accounting prior to obtaining controlling interest in MK Panama during the second quarter of Fiscal 2016.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net increased $2.4 million to $4.1 million for Fiscal 2017, as compared to $1.7 million for Fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher interest expense due to an increase in borrowings outstanding and lower interest income due to a decline in our short-term investments (cash-equivalents) during Fiscal 2017.
Foreign Currency Loss
We recognized foreign currency losses of $2.6 million and $4.8 million during Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, respectively, which were primarily attributable to net losses on the revaluation and settlement of certain of our account payable in currencies other than the functional currency of the applicable reporting units, as well as the remeasurement of dollar-denominated intercompany loans with certain of our subsidiaries. The net foreign currency losses for Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016 also included favorable mark-to-market adjustments of $2.6 million and unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments of $2.1 million, respectively, related to our forward foreign currency contracts not designated as accounting hedges.
Provision for Income Taxes
We recognized $137.1 million of income tax expense during Fiscal 2017, compared with $334.6 million for Fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2017 was 19.9%, compared to 28.5% for Fiscal 2016. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of global financing activities as well as the increase in taxable income in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries (predominantly European operations) during Fiscal 2017, which are subject to lower statutory income tax rates. The global financing activities are related to our previously disclosed 2014 move of our principal executive office from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and decision to become a U.K. tax resident. In connection with this decision, we funded our international growth strategy through intercompany debt financing arrangements between our U.S., U.K. and Switzerland subsidiaries in December 2015. Accordingly, due to the difference in the statutory income tax rates between these jurisdictions, we realized a reduction in our effective tax rate. The impact on our effective tax rate was higher in Fiscal 2017 than in Fiscal 2016 because the debt financing arrangements were initiated near the end of Fiscal 2016. Due to our substantial international growth and expansion over the past several years and our Company being a U.K. tax resident, we believe that it is most appropriate to reconcile our effective tax rate to the U.K. statutory tax rate.
Our effective tax rate may fluctuate from time to time due to the effects of changes in U.S. state and local taxes and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, factors such as the geographic mix of earnings, enacted tax legislation and the results of various global tax strategies, may also impact our effective tax rate in future periods.
Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest
During Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2016, we recorded a net loss attributable to our noncontrolling interest in MK Panama of $1.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively. These losses represent the share of MK Panama’s net loss that is not attributable to the Company.
Net Income Attributable to MKHL
As a result of the foregoing, our net income attributable to MKHL declined $286.6 million, or 34.2%, to $552.5 million during Fiscal 2017, compared to $839.1 million for Fiscal 2016, which included net favorable foreign currency effects of $2.9 million. Fiscal 2017 net income reflected approximately $148.3 million of impairment charges, net of taxes, primarily related to asset write downs for underperforming Michael Kors retail stores, as described above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, along with borrowings available under our credit facilities (see below discussion regarding “Revolving Credit Facilities”) and available cash and cash equivalents. Our primary use of this liquidity is to fund the ongoing cash requirements, including our working capital needs and capital investments in our business, debt repayments, acquisitions, returns of capital including share repurchases, dividends and other corporate activities. We believe that the cash generated from our operations, together with borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities and available cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next 12 months, including investments made and expenses incurred in connection with our store growth plans, shop-in-shop growth, investments in corporate and distribution facilities, continued systems development, e-commerce and marketing initiatives. We spent $120.4 million on capital expenditures during Fiscal 2018, and expect to spend approximately $250.0 million during Fiscal 2019. The majority of the Fiscal 2018 expenditures related to our retail operations (including e-commerce), with the remainder related to enhancements to our distribution and information systems infrastructure and our corporate offices, as well as in connection with new shop-in-shops.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities increased $27.9 million to $1.063 billion during Fiscal 2018, as compared to $1.035 billion for Fiscal 2017. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase related to changes in our working capital, partially offset by a decrease in our net income after non-cash adjustments. The increase related to our working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily driven by restructuring liabilities recorded in Fiscal 2018 and the timing of tax related payments, and favorable changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories primarily due to timing. These increases were partially offset by lower accounts payable primarily due to the timing of payments and an unfavorable change in accounts receivable primarily due to a higher decline in wholesale inventory purchases in the prior year.
Cash provided by operating activities decreased $214.9 million to $1.035 billion billion during Fiscal 2017, as compared to $1.250 billion for Fiscal 2016. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in our net income after non-cash adjustments, as well as a decrease related to changes in our working capital, which was primarily attributable to an unfavorable change in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily due to the timing of tax and royalty payments, partially offset by favorable changes in inventory and accounts payable due to lower wholesale inventory purchases and shipments, as well as the timing of payments.

Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities increased $882.5 million to $1.533 billion during Fiscal 2018, compared to $650.9 million during Fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash was primarily attributable to a $933.9 million increase of cash paid, net of cash acquired, in connection with our Fiscal 2018 acquisition of the Jimmy Choo business, as compared to our acquisition of the previously licensed business in Greater China during Fiscal 2017. This decrease in cash was partially offset by lower capital expenditures of $44.4 million, due to lower spending related to build-outs of new stores and shop-in-shops and lower corporate expenditures.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $269.8 million to $650.9 million during Fiscal 2017, compared to $381.1 million during Fiscal 2016. The decrease in cash was primarily attributable to $480.6 million of cash paid, net of cash acquired, in connection with our acquisition of the previously licensed business in Greater China during Fiscal 2017, partially offset by lower capital expenditures of $204.4 million, attributable to lower corporate expenditures and lower spending to build out new stores and shop-in-shops, partially offset by capital spending related to our newly acquired operations in China and South Korea and increased investments in our e-commerce business.
Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $389.6 million during Fiscal 2018, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $850.2 million during Fiscal 2017. The $1.240 billion increase in cash from financing activities was due to increased debt borrowings of $590.9 million, which included senior notes and term loan borrowings to finance the acquisition of Jimmy Choo, net of cash repayments, as well as a decrease of $643.8 million in cash payments to repurchase our ordinary shares.
Net cash used in financing activities decreased $299.2 million to $850.2 million during Fiscal 2017, from $1.149 billion during Fiscal 2016, which was primarily attributable to increased borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility of $153.4 million, net of debt repayments and a decrease of $147.6 million in cash payments to repurchase our ordinary shares.

(1) The 2017 Credit Facility contains customary events of default and requires us to maintain a leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter of no greater than 3.5 to 1, calculated as the ratio of the sum of total indebtedness as of the date of the measurement plus 6.0 times the consolidated rent expense for the last four consecutive fiscal quarters, to Consolidated EBITDAR for the last four consecutive fiscal quarters. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined as consolidated net income plus income tax expense, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, consolidated rent expense and other non-cash charges, subject to certain deductions. The 2017 Credit Facility also includes other customary covenants that limit additional indebtedness, guarantees, liens, acquisitions and other investments and cash dividends. As of March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our agreements then in effect governing our debt.

(2) Recorded as short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 and April 1, 2017.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) The $1.0 billion facility was fully utilized to finance a portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of Jimmy Choo on November 1, 2017, a portion of which was repaid during Fiscal 2018. See Note 3 for additional information.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Recorded as long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2018.

We believe that our 2017 Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. As of March 31, 2018, there were 13 financial institutions participating in the facility, with none maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 15%. We have no reason to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the 2017 Credit Facility.
See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for detailed information relating to our credit facilities.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
As of March 31, 2018, our lease commitments and contractual obligations were as follows (in millions):

------------------------------ ---------- ------- --------------- ----- --------------- ----- ------------------------- ----- ----- ----- ----- - -------

Fiscal Years Ending Fiscal2019 Fiscal2020-2021 Fiscal2022-2023 Fiscal 2024 andThereafter Total
Operating leases $ 323.9 $ 578.8 $ 472.5 $ 531.4 $ 1,906.6

Total $ 1,339.2 $ 755.6 $ 565.5 $ 977.7 $ 3,638.0

Operating lease obligations represent our equipment leases and the minimum lease rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases for our real estate locations globally. In addition to the above amounts, we are typically required to pay real estate taxes, contingent rent based on sales volume and other occupancy costs relating to our leased properties for our retail stores.
Inventory purchase obligations represent our contractual agreements relating to future purchases of inventory.
Other commitments include our non-cancelable contractual obligations related to marketing and advertising agreements, information technology agreements, and supply agreements.
Excluded from the above commitments is $100.8 million of long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, due to the uncertainty of the time and nature of resolution.
The above table also excludes current liabilities (other than short-term debt) recorded as of March 31, 2018, as these items will be paid within one year, and non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred taxes).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. In addition to the commitments in the above table, our off-balance sheet commitments relating to our outstanding letters of credit were $20.3 million at March 31, 2018, including $4.4 million in letters of credit issued outside of the 2017 Credit Facility. In addition, as of March 31, 2018, bank guarantees of approximately $1.5 million were supported by our Hong Kong Credit Facility. We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Effects of Inflation
We do not believe that our sales or operating results have been materially impacted by inflation during the periods presented in our financial statements. However, we may experience an increase in cost pressure from our suppliers in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our gross profit results in the periods effected.

In connection with our entry into the agreement to acquire RB Foods, we entered into a commitment letter, dated July 18, 2017 (the "Commitment Letter"), under which certain banks agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") of up to $4.2 billion in the aggregate. On August 7, 2017, we entered into a Senior Unsecured Bridge Credit Agreement with certain financial institutions under which those financial institutions agreed to provide a senior unsecured 364-day bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility") for the purpose of providing the financing necessary to fund all or a portion of the consideration to be paid pursuant to the terms of the agreement related to the acquisition of RB Foods and related fees and expenses (the "Bridge Loan Commitment"). The Bridge Facility provided that the Bridge Loan Commitment would be reduced in equivalent amounts upon any incurrence by McCormick of, among other things, term loans and/or the issuance of equity or notes in a public offering or private placement prior to the consummation of the transaction, subject to certain exce...

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS TubeMogul On December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMogul's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired. Fotolia On January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos.
