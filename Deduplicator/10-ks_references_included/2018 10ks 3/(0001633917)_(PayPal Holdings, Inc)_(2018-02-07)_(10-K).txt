Separation from eBay Inc.

On September 30, 2014, eBay Inc. (“eBay”) announced its intent to separate its payments business into an independent, publicly traded company. To accomplish this separation, in January 2015, eBay incorporated PayPal Holdings, Inc. (“PayPal Holdings”) which is now the parent of PayPal, Inc. and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with PayPal, Inc. In June 2015, the board of directors of eBay approved the separation (the “separation”) of eBay's payments business through the distribution (the “distribution”) of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay's stockholders. PayPal Holdings' registration statement on Form 10, as amended, was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2015. On July 17, 2015 (the “distribution date”), PayPal Holdings became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by eBay of 100% of the outstanding common stock of PayPal Holdings to eBay stockholders. Each eBay stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 8, 2015 received one share of PayPal Holdings common stock for every share of eBay common stock held on the record date. Approximately 1.2 billion shares of PayPal Holdings common stock were distributed on July 17, 2015 to eBay stockholders. PayPal Holdings' common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “PYPL” on the NASDAQ Stock Market on July 20, 2015.

Prior to the separation, eBay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of eBay's payments business to PayPal Holdings, which was completed in June 2015 (the “capitalization”). The consolidated financial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a stand-alone basis and were derived from eBay's consolidated financial statements and accounting records. The consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of eBay prior to the capitalization. Following the capitalization, our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PayPal Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate stand-alone entity during the periods presented, nor are they indicative of what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be in the future. For additional information, see “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “PayPal” refer to PayPal Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the case of information as of dates or for periods prior to the separation, the consolidated entities of the payments business of eBay, including PayPal, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities that had been historically held at the eBay corporate level but were specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments business.

Business Environment

We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide.

We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.

The United Kingdom ("U.K.") held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union ("EU") (“Brexit”). In March 2017, the U.K. government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the EU and started the process of negotiating the future terms of the U.K.'s relationship with the EU. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European) and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro.

We have foreign exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency rate movements. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues generated from our U.K. operations constituted 11%, 12% and 13%, respectively, of total net revenues. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted approximately 20% of total net revenues. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption—“The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us.”

Information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased in recent years. Although we are not aware of any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches on our Payments Platform, we are not immune to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” under the caption—“Our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches.”

Net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 21%, in 2017 and $1.6 billion, or 17%, in 2016. The increases were primarily driven by growth in TPV (as defined below under “Net Revenues”) of 27% in 2017 and 26% in 2016. Net revenues from our recent acquisitions of TIO and Swift were not material. Net revenues from Xoom (acquired in November 2015) contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate.

Table of Contents

Total operating expenses increased $1.7 billion, or 18%, in 2017 and $1.5 billion or 19% in 2016. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, sales and marketing, general and administrative, product development, and restructuring and other charges. Operating expenses related to TIO and Swift collectively contributed one percentage point to the 2017 growth rate. The increase in total operating expense in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and transaction and loan losses which increase with TPV and higher customer support and operations, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization incurred to operate as an independent public company, partially offset by a decrease in restructuring expense. Xoom operating expenses contributed three percentage points to the 2016 growth rate.

Operating income increased $541 million, or 34%, in 2017 and $125 million, or 9% in 2016. Operating income increased in 2017 and 2016 due primarily to the increase in net revenues, partially offset by the growth in operating expenses. TIO and Swift collectively had a negative impact our 2017 growth rate of four percentage points. Xoom negatively impacted our 2016 growth rate by four percentage points. Our operating margin was 16%, 15% and 16% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating margin in 2017 was negatively impacted by growth in our transaction expense which increased 32% in 2017 compared to 2016, compared to net revenues which increased 21% in the same period, as well as restructuring expense of $40 million incurred in 2017. These impacts were offset by operating efficiencies in our business, and a one time benefit of $322 million pertaining to reversal of allowances related to loans and interest receivables due to the designation as held for sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Operating margin decreased in 2016 due primarily to growth in our transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, which together increased 30% in 2016 compared to 2015.

Net income increased by $394 million, or 28%, in 2017 and $173 million, or 14%, in 2016. The increase in net income in 2017 was attributable to an increase in operating income of $541 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $28 million, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $175 million. The increase in net income in 2016 was attributable to an increase in operating income of $125 million, a decrease in income tax expense of $30 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $18 million.

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we generated approximately 46%, 47% and 50% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the United States, respectively. During each of these periods, U.K. was the only country, other than the United States, where we generated more than 10% of total net revenues in. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted approximately 20% of total net revenues. Because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods, including during the periods presented, we are subject to the risks of doing business in countries outside of the U.S. as discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.”
We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges designed to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.

In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the year-over-year foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- -- ---- --- - ---- -

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016
 (In millions)
Favorable (Unfavorable) impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging impact) $ 10 $ (196 )
Hedging impact 17 119
Favorable (Unfavorable) impact to net revenues 27 (77 )
(Unfavorable) Favorable impact to operating expense (21 ) 86
Net impact to operating income $ 6 $ 9

While we enter into foreign exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure.
Additionally, in connection with our services in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates twice per day, and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.

Financial Results
Net revenues
Revenue description
We earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our Payments Platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:

39

Table of Contents

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to consumers and merchants primarily based on the volume of activity, or Total Payments Volume (“TPV”), processed through our Payments Platform. We define TPV as the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products. We earn additional fees on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant or consumer are in different countries).

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Other value added services: Net revenues derived principally from interest and fees earned on our loans and interest receivable, net and held for sale portfolio, subscription fees, gateway fees, gains on sale of participation interests in certain consumer loans receivable and working capital loans and advances, revenue share we earn through partnerships, interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances, fees earned through our Paydiant products and other services that we provide to consumers and merchants.

Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:

- --------------------------------------------
• The mix of merchants, products and services;

- -------------------------------------------------------
• The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------
• The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The amount of PayPal credit loans receivable outstanding with consumers and merchants.

Net revenues analysis
The components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

-------------------------- --------------------------------- ------ --------------------------- ----- ---- ------ ----- ---- ----- - -- - -- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease)
 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016
 (In millions, except percentages)
Transaction revenues $ 11,402 $ 9,490 $ 8,128 20 % 17 %
Other value added services 1,692 1,352 1,120 25 % 21 %
Net revenues $ 13,094 $ 10,842 $ 9,248 21 % 17 %

Transaction revenues
Transaction revenues increased by $1.9 billion, or 20%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and by $1.4 billion, or 17%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in transaction revenues in 2017 and 2016 was due primarily to the growth in TPV, mainly from our PayPal and Braintree products, and in the number of payment transactions, both of which were due primarily to an increase in our active customer accounts and increased engagement from our customers (measured by payment transactions per active account). Xoom transaction revenues contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate. Net gains from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2017 were $17 million, compared to $119 million in 2016. Refer to “Note 8—Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program.

Percent of cross-border TPV 21 % 22 % 22 % ** **

All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.
(1) An active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products, in the past 12 months.
(2) Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.
(3) Number of payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period, divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period.
(4) TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, excluding transactions processed through our gateway and Paydiant products.
** Not meaningful
Transaction revenues grew more slowly than both TPV and number of payment transactions in 2017 due primarily to a higher proportion of person-to-person (“P2P”) transactions, primarily from our PayPal and Venmo products from which we earn lower rates and foreign exchange hedging losses. The percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth in TPV and payment transactions in 2016 primarily due to a higher proportion of P2P transactions (including our Venmo products) for which we earn lower rates, and a higher portion of TPV generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volume. The impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2017 or 2016.

Other value added services

Net revenues from other value added services increased by $340 million, or 25%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and by $232 million, or 21%, in 2016 compared to 2015. Growth in net revenues from other value-added services in 2017 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our PayPal credit loans receivable portfolio. Swift revenues contributed approximately three percentage points to the 2017 growth rate. The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance, including loans and receivables, held for sale, as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $7.8 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 37%.
In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, which we believe will enable us, at closing, to free up balance sheet capacity and cash flow for other uses, and mitigate balance sheet risk. Historically, this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro-rata allowances including, unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. Upon approval of the decision to sell these receivables from our Board of Directors, the portfolio was reclassified as held for sale, and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Due to the designation as held for sale, the associated allowance for this portfolio was reversed, resulting in an increase of approximately $39 million in revenue from other value added services. This transaction will be accounted for as a sale, and the receivables will no longer be reported in our consolidated financial statements

Following the closing of this transaction, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we will no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than charged off receivables). In addition, we will earn a profit share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony Bank.

Growth in net revenues from other value added services in 2016 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our PayPal Credit loans receivable portfolio. The total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $5.7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 29%.

Table of Contents

In the third quarter of 2015, we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with Synchrony Bank. As a result of the amendment, we recognized $78 million of revenue under the agreement during 2015. In addition, as part of the amended agreement, our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with Synchrony Bank was terminated. The amended credit program agreement will, upon closing of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivable portfolio to Synchrony Bank, be superseded by the new program agreement signed in November 2017.

In the second quarter of 2015, we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in certain consumer loans and interest receivables related to our PayPal Credit product with a gross book value of approximately $708 million. In connection with its purchase of our U.S. consumer credit receivable portfolio, Synchrony Bank has also agreed to acquire the participation interests held by the investors.

Operating Expenses

Beginning with the first quarter of 2016, we reclassified certain operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to better align our external and internal financial reporting. These classification changes relate primarily to real estate and information technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among customer support and operations expense, sales and marketing expense and product development expense. Our management no longer allocates these operating expenses for internal financial reporting purposes or general management of the business and has therefore discontinued this allocation for external financial reporting purposes. As a result, starting with the first quarter of 2016 these operating expenses were reported as part of general and administrative expenses. These changes have no impact on the previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods, including total operating expenses, financial position or cash flows for any periods presented, and do not eliminate any of the costs allocated to us by eBay for any periods prior to the separation. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of operating expenses to our previously reported consolidated statement of income. Growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts.

The following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each:

Transaction expense

Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our PayPal Credit funding option. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. As we expand the availability of alternative

funding sources to our customers, a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S.

Transaction expense increased by $1.1 billion, or 32%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased by $736 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in transaction expense in 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 27% and higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions. The increase in transaction expense in 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 26%.

The increase in our transaction expense rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions. Our transaction expense rate in 2016 increased compared to 2015 due primarily to changes in funding mix. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 2% of TPV was funded with PayPal Credit. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, approximately 44%, 45%, and 45% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. Interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable, included in transaction expense, was not material for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
Transaction and loan losses

Transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the losses associated with our consumer and merchant loans receivable portfolio, except loans and interest receivable, held for sale. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchant sellers. Additionally, prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts from eBay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible eBay purchases made with PayPal. These costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with eBay's customer protection programs that we administered and funded on behalf of eBay, which were included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses. Recoveries associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $27 million. Following the distribution, we no longer administer eBay's customer protection programs or recover amounts from eBay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible eBay purchases; instead, we and eBay each independently administer our own customer protection programs. Further, our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on eBay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.

The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

--------------------------- --------------------------------- ----- --------------------------- --- ---- ----- ---- ---- --- -- -- -- -- -

 Year Ended December 31, Percent Increase/(Decrease)
 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016
 (In millions, except percentages)
Transaction losses $ 823 $ 655 $ 511 26 % 28 %
Loan losses 188 433 298 (57 )% 45 %
Transaction and loan losses $ 1,011 $ 1,088 $ 809 (7 )% 34 %

Transaction and loan losses decreased by $77 million, or 7%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased by $279 million, or 34%, in 2016 compared to 2015.

Transaction losses increased by $168 million, or 26%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased by $144 million, or 28%, in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to higher TPV. Our transaction loss rate, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, in 2017 and 2016 was roughly flat compared to 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in transaction losses in 2016 was higher than the growth in TPV in 2016 due primarily to lower incremental costs in 2015 associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution.

Loan losses decreased by $245 million, or 57%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased by $135 million, or 45%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in loan losses in 2017 was due primarily to the reversal of approximately $283 million of allowance on loans receivable due to the designation of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale. The increase in loan losses in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year and additional reserves recorded in that period due to increases to forecasted principal balance delinquency rates. The total consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $326 million, $5.1 billion, and $4.0 billion, respectively, reflecting year-over-year decrease of 94% from 2016 to 2017 and an increase of 28% from 2015 to 2016. The decrease in consumer loan receivables in 2017 was due to designation of U.S. consumer credit portfolio as held for sale. The increase in consumer loans receivable in 2016 was due to the growth in the portfolio of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers who chose PayPal Credit as a funding option and an increase in working capital advances to selected merchant sellers.

The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our pool of consumer loans and interest receivable balances:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------ - ---- ---- -

 December 31,
 2017 2016
Percent of consumer loans and interest receivables current(1) 96.0 % 90.0 %
Percent of consumer loans and interest receivables > 90 days outstanding(1)(2) 1.2 % 4.1 %
Net charge off rate(1)(3) 3.9 % 6.4 %

(1) Amounts as of December 31, 2017 represent loans and interest receivables due from consumer accounts not classified as held for sale and amounts as of December 31, 2016 represent total consumer loans and interest receivables including U.S. consumer receivables because they were not classified as held for sale as of that date.
(2) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer.
(3) Net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year.

Through our PayPal Working Capital product, we offer credit products to certain small and medium-sized merchants that are existing users of our other payment services. Total PayPal Working Capital loans, advances and fees receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2017, net of participation interest sold, were $703 million. Total PayPal Working Capital loans, advances and fees receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2016 were $558 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 26% due to the increase in the availability of our credit products domestically and internationally.

To assess a merchant who requests a PayPal Working Capital loan or advance, we use, among other indicators, an internally developed risk model that we refer to as our PayPal Working Capital Risk Model (“PRM”), as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchant's ability to repay the amount of the loan or advance and fixed fee. The PRM uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant's ability to repay a working capital loan or advance. Primary drivers of the model include the merchant's annual payment volume and payment processing history with PayPal, prior repayment history with the PayPal Working Capital product, and other measures. Merchants are assigned a PRM credit score within the range of 350 to 750. We generally expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital loan or advance will have PRM scores greater than 525. We generally consider scores above 610 to be very good and to pose less credit risk. For all outstanding working capital loans and advances, we assess a participating merchant’s PRM score on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the weighted average PRM score related to our PayPal Working Capital balances outstanding was 619 and 625, respectively.

The number of days our PayPal Working Capital loans and advances receivables are past due is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed fee as compared to an original expected repayment period. We generally calculate the repayment rate of the merchant's estimated future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a monthly basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes. We monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected repayment period.

As of December 31, 2017, the total outstanding balance in our pool of Swift merchant loans, advances, interest and fees receivable was $309 million. We closely monitor credit quality for all merchant loans and advances, so that we can evaluate, quantify, and manage our credit risk exposure. To assess a merchant seeking a loan or an advance, we use, among other indicators, a risk model developed internally which utilizes information obtained from multiple data sources, both external and internal, to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fixed fee. Drivers of the model include elements sourced from a consumer credit bureau report, business credit bureau report, prior repayment history with our products where available, and other information obtained during the application process. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our internal model, plan our collection practices and strategies and in the end our determination of our allowance for these loans and advances.

For Swift business loan and advance products, the determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan and fixed fee payment as compared to the original expected repayment period.

The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant receivables:

Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loans. For additional information, see "Note 10—Loans and Interest Receivable" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Customer support and operations

Customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers and other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products.

Customer support and operations costs increased $97 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $157 million, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in network infrastructure expenses and contractor and employee related expenses to support the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in contractor and employee related expenses to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform.

Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition, business development, advertising, marketing programs, and employee compensation and contractor costs to support these programs.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $159 million, or 16%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $32 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to higher spend on external marketing campaigns and higher employee related expenses. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to higher marketing spend related to Xoom on advertising campaigns intended to enhance our global brand recognition.

Product development

Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the development of our Payments Platform, new products and the improvement of our existing products. Product development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense.
Product development expenses increased $119 million, or 14%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $42 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses. The increase in

Table of Contents

2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses, driven primarily by Xoom, offset by a decrease in contractor related expenses.
General and administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, risk and compliance, executive and other support operations. Our legal expenses, including those related to ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings, settlements, judgments and fines, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.
For the period prior to the separation, our consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with workplace resources and information technology that were previously allocated to the Payments segment of eBay, and additional expenses related to certain corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These expenses also include allocations related to stock-based compensation. The expenses incurred by eBay were allocated to us based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic measure. The corporate costs and allocation of expenses from eBay may not be indicative of the expenses that may have been incurred had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the period presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of the expenses we may incur in the future. Such expenses could be higher or lower. In the period presented prior to the separation, a significant portion of expenses associated with these functions and allocated to us in our consolidated financial statements are included in general and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $127 million, or 12%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $155 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses and professional expenses, and continued investments in compliance programs. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee expenses, contractor related expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company, and continued investments in compliance programs.

Depreciation and amortization

The primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of software, including the amortization of capitalized software and website development costs, amortization of equipment used to deliver our services and the amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $81 million, or 11%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased $116 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were due primarily to additional depreciation expenses associated with investments in our technology platform. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $126 million, $150 million and $93 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles in 2017 was due primarily to lower amortization expense resulting from fully amortized assets. Additionally, the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2017 was partially attributable to an impairment charge of $30 million related to a portion of the acquired customer-related intangible assets. For additional information, see “Note 4—Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2016 was due primarily to our acquisitions completed in 2015.

Restructuring and other charges

Restructuring and other charges consist of restructuring expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio. Restructuring and other charges increased by $132 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to restructuring charges of $40 million and cost adjustments of $92 million related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio.

In the first quarter of 2017, management approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce which was substantially completed by the end of 2017. We recognized $40 million of restructuring expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017. No restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016. In January 2015, at a regular meeting of eBay’s board of directors (the “eBay Board”), the eBay Board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce. The reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses. Restructuring expenses were $48 million in 2015.

Subsequent to the designation as held for sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in November 2017, approximately $92 million related to adjustments to the cost basis, which are primarily driven by charge offs against those loans and interest receivables, were recorded in restructuring and other charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Income Tax Expense

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; creation of new minimum taxes such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which will result in a one time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the “Transition Tax”).

In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of $180 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This discrete expense consists of provisional estimates of $1,468 million net expense for the Transition Tax payable in installments over eight years, $1,295 million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, and $7 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets/liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance.

We have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act, including the new GILTI and BEAT taxes. Due to the complexity of these new tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act and whether such taxes are recorded as a current-period expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes. As a result, we have not included an estimate of the tax expense/benefit related to these items for the period ended December 31, 2017.

Our effective tax rate was 18% in 2017, 14% in 2016, and 17% in 2015. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily due to discrete net tax expense recorded for U.S. tax reform, partially offset by the adoption of the new stock-based compensation accounting standard in 2017. The decrease in our effective tax rate during 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to favorable discrete tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2016 and other separation-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. See “Note 17—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that create differences between the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K, the following portion of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We present non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparisons of our results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things; evaluate our operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.

We exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the operation of our business.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.

Table of Contents

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Separation. These are significant expenses related to the separation of our business from eBay into a separate, independent publicly traded company. These consist primarily of third-party consulting fees, legal fees, employee retention payments and other expenses incurred to complete the separation. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Restructuring. These consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. We exclude restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Certain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of our core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP results because management does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operating results.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.

The following table provides reconciliations of our consolidated non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

(3) The weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was based on the number of common shares distributed on July 17, 2015 for the period prior to distribution and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period beginning after the distribution date.

In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, we also use free cash flow to assess our performance. Free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, and including investments in our Payments Platform, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including customer protection programs, our PayPal credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions, working capital and other cash needs. The following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:

Cash, cash equivalents and investments(1)(2) $ 7,487 $ 6,447

(1) Excludes assets related to customer accounts of $18.2 billion and $14.4 billion at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
(2) Excludes total restricted cash of $81 million and $17 million at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and cost method investments of $88 million and $50 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

Cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $6.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $5.0 billion at December 31, 2016, or 81% and 78% of our total cash, cash equivalents and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2017 all of our cash, cash equivalents and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under the one-time transition tax as further discussed in “Note 17—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Subsequent repatriations will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state or foreign withholding tax.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a credit agreement ("2017 Credit Agreement") that provides for an unsecured $3.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which is available in up to three borrowings. Borrowings and other amounts payable under the 2017 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our PayPal, Inc. subsidiary. Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the 2017 Credit Agreement provided that we and PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the 2017 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the 2017 Credit Agreement may be used for capital allocation and other general corporate purposes of us and our subsidiaries.

Loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank's prime rate, the NYFRB rate (the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate) or LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.25 percent. The 2017 Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable in December 2018, unless the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events). Subject to certain exceptions, if we were to issue debt securities or enter into a credit facility, a corresponding portion of the aggregate commitments and outstanding loans under the 2017 Credit Agreement will be terminated and be required to be paid, as applicable. The 2017 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, based on our public debt ratings.

As of December 31, 2017, $1.0 billion was outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement at an interest rate of 2.78% (one month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.125%). Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2017 Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

The company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, aggregating to approximately $250 million. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under these facilities, and therefore, approximately $250 million of borrowing capacity was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (“2015 Credit Agreement” and collectively with the 2017 Credit Agreement, the "Credit Agreements") that provides for an unsecured $2.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $150 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Borrowings and other amounts payable under the 2015 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our PayPal, Inc. subsidiary. We may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $500 million.

Subject to specified conditions, we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the 2015 Credit Agreement provided that we and PayPal, Inc. guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the 2015 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers. Funds borrowed under the 2015 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.

Loans under the 2015 Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from 1.00 percent to 1.625 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate, the federal funds effective rate or LIBOR plus a margin (based on our public debt ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.625 percent. Subject to certain conditions stated in the 2015 Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the 2015 Credit Agreement. The 2015 Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on July 17, 2020, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders. The 2015 Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, based on our public debt ratings.

During the third quarter of 2017, we drew down $800 million under the 2015 Credit Agreement, which was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2017, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2015 Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of $3.3 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $3.3 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.

Growth in the portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding of our credit portfolio. In March 2016, as approved by management and our Luxembourg banking subsidiary's Supervisory Board and as permitted within regulations set forth by the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the "CSSF"), we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an additional amount of $700 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary was approved and designated to be used to extend credit to our U.S. consumers. These funds were classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet on the date of designation and represent approximately 30% of European customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at December 31, 2017 as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal.

In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank. Historically, this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances, net of any participation interest sold and pro-rata allowances including, unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees. Following the closing of this transaction, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, Synchrony Bank will become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we will no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program (other than charged off receivables).

As of December 31, 2017, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor's Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Ratings, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on loans under the Credit Agreements. The risk of losses from our customer protection

programs are specific to individual customers, merchants and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rates, calculated by dividing transaction loss by TPV, ranged between 0.18% and 0.19% of TPV. Historical trends may not be an indication of future results.

In January 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. In April 2017, our Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. This program became effective upon completion of the January 2016 stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. Any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives. However, any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made. Moreover, we may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without notice.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of our common stock under our January 2016 and April 2017 stock repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2017, a total of approximately $5.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our April 2017 stock repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased approximately $995 million of our common stock under our January 2016 stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2016, a total of approximately $1.0 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our January 2016 stock repurchase program.

Our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third party sources, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and PayPal credit products for the foreseeable future. Depending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, repurchase shares under our share repurchase program, or reduce our cost of capital.

Cash Flows

In March 2016, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an additional amount of $700 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary was approved and designated to be used to extend credit to our U.S. consumers. We have presented changes in funds receivable and customer accounts as cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts which includes purchases of investments, maturities and sales of investments and changes in funds receivable and customer accounts. We have elected to conform the prior period statement of cash flows to the current period presentation to enhance transparency and provide comparability. See “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of our statement of cash flows to our previously reported consolidated statement of cash flows.

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as a negative impact to changes in other assets and liabilities in cash from operating activities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017). Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017) have no impact on cash from operating activities.

We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2017 due primarily to operating income of approximately $2.1 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation were approximately $1.5 billion during 2017. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.0 billion during 2017. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by adjustments for non-cash expenses related to deferred income taxes of approximately $1.3 billion during 2017. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to loans and interest receivable held for sale, net of $1.3 billion due to changes in the presentation of originations and collections on loans within the U.S. consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017, which are now presented in operating activities instead of investing activities, offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of $634 million. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio for originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities.

We generated cash from operating activities of $3.2 billion in 2016 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.6 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.1 billion during 2016. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses, net.

We generated cash from operating activities of $2.5 billion in 2015 due primarily to operating income of approximately $1.5 billion. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation (including excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation) were approximately $928 million during 2015. Adjustments to non-cash expenses related to transaction and loan losses were approximately $809 million during 2015. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to actual transaction losses paid during the period. Additional uses of cash impacting cash generated from operating activities include net cash outflows relating to settlement of eBay payables and receivables of approximately $96 million and increases in accounts receivable of approximately $22 million.

Cash paid for income taxes in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $117 million, $48 million and $216 million, respectively.

Investing Activities

Cash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and sales of investments, cash paid for acquisitions, purchases and sales of property and equipment, changes in principal loans receivable, funds receivable and customer accounts. For periods prior to the distribution, it also includes notes payable and receivable from eBay.

The net cash used in investing activities of $5.4 billion in 2017 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $19.4 billion, increase in funds receivable and customer accounts of $2.5 billion including the reclassification of $700 million of European

customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents, changes in principal loans receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our consumer and merchant credit products excluding originations and collections pertaining to the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017 which are now presented in operating activities, of $920 million, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $323 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $667 million. These net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.5 billion. Collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio for originations that occurred prior to November 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities.

The net cash used in investing activities of $5.0 billion in 2016 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $21.0 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal credit products of $1.5 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $669 million and net increases in funds receivable from customers and customer accounts of $176 million, including the reclassification of $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents. These net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of $18.4 billion.
The net cash used in investing activities of $8.0 billion in 2015 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $21.6 billion, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $1.2 billion, increases in our loan receivable portfolio (net of collections) originated through our PayPal credit products of $819 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $722 million. These net cash outflows were offset in part by maturities and sales of investments of $16.1 billion and net cash inflows relating to receivables from eBay of $575 million.
Financing Activities

Cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards, borrowings net of repayments under financing arrangements, funds payable and amounts due to customers, and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation (for periods prior to 2017). For periods prior to the distribution, it also includes contribution from eBay.

The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.1 billion in 2017 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $4.3 billion and borrowings of $1.0 billion, partially offset by repayment of a loan of $170 million assumed in connection with our acquisition of Swift Financial, the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $166 million.

The net cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion in 2016 was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $3.0 billion, offset in part by the repurchase of $995 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program.

The net cash provided by financing activities of $4.7 billion in 2015 was due primarily to a contribution of approximately $3.9 billion of cash from eBay and increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.6 billion, offset in part by repayments of borrowings from eBay of $862 million.

Free Cash Flow

We define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment.

Free cash flow was $1.9 billion in 2017, a decrease of $625 million from 2016. The decrease in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to lower cash generated from operating activities of $627 million, which was impacted by the change in presentation from investing activities to operating activities of originations and collections on the U.S. consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in November 2017. Free cash flow generated during 2017 was used for repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, funding our credit portfolio, acquisitions and general business purposes.

Free cash flow was $2.5 billion in 2016, an increase of $665 million from 2015. The increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of $612 million and lower purchases of property and equipment of $53 million. Free cash flow generated during 2016 was used for funding our credit portfolio, repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase program, and general business purposes.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” for information on how we compute free cash flow and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash

The positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2017 of $36 million was due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. Currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on cash and cash equivalents in 2016. The negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015 of $44 million was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Future Liquidity and Obligations

As of December 31, 2017, approximately $26.4 billion of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $28.8 billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2016. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all of our PayPal Credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of our U.S. PayPal Credit consumer products based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. When a consumer funds a purchase in the U.S. using a PayPal credit product issued by a chartered financial institution, the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer, funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant. We subsequently purchase the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and, as a result of such purchase, bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults. Although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account, we own the related receivable (excluding participation interests sold) and are responsible for all servicing functions related to the account. Upon the closing of the sale of our loans and interest receivables, held for sale, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018, we will no longer purchase receivables related to the U.S. consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution.

We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2017 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations.

The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services and construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office and data center facilities. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly

from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Transition Tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act, as further discussed in “Note 17—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $383 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.
Seasonality
The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2017, 2016 or 2015 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.

Transaction and loan losses

Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our PayPal credit products, which include our PayPal Credit consumer product and merchant loans and advances consisting of PayPal Working Capital and Swift business loans and advances to merchant sellers.
We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, buyer protection program claims, account takeovers, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statements of income. The allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other actual data received. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.
We also establish an allowance for loans receivable, which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our consumer loans receivable and merchant loans and advances. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our consolidated financial statements. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. In connection with the pending sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank, and the designation of that portfolio as held for sale in November 2017, we released corresponding allowances against those loans and interest receivable balances. Such allowances on any newly originated U.S. consumer loan receivables from and after November

56

Table of Contents

2017 will not be established. Adjustments to the cost basis of this portfolio, which are primarily driven by charge offs, are recorded in restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of income. For our consumer loan receivables not subject to the sale agreement with Synchrony Bank, consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables, the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates (“roll rates”). Roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our international consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency, from current to 180 days past the payment due date, in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. For merchant loans and advances receivable, that includes PayPal Working Capital and Swift business loan and advance products, the allowance is primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.
The determination of delinquency, from current to 180 days past due, for principal balances related to merchant loans and advances is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan or advance and interest or fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period. For PayPal Working Capital product we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant's expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance. On a regular basis, we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable. As such, actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes.
The allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model. Increases to the allowance for fees receivable is recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.

We charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment due date. We charge off the PayPal Working Capital receivable when the updated repayment period is 180 days past the original expected repayment period and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days. We also charge off the receivable when the updated repayment period is 360 days past the original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of bankruptcy. Loans receivable past the payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off, with the portion of the reserve related to the interest receivable balance classified as a reduction of revenue for international consumers and recorded in restructuring and other charges for the U.S. consumer receivables, in our consolidated statement of income. For Swift business loan and advance products, we charge off the receivable when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of bankruptcy. The provision for loan losses is recognized in transaction and loan losses. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable.

Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2017, an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately $101 million.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through new provisions under the Tax Act such as the new GILTI tax and BEAT or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a

57

Table of Contents

number of factors, including our historical experience and short range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.
We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.

Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2017, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $22 million.

Loss Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation or other violation and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.

Revenue Recognition

Application of the various accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants, which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized.

Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles

The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.
We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance, the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar to the FASB guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment.

58

Table of Contents

In performing these qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, we must perform a quantitative impairment test.
Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, using present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, or using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure.

Business Environment

We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. Our vision is to democratize financial services, as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for all people, not just the affluent. Our goal is to increase our relevance for consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and using any device. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products, compose our proprietary Payments Platform.

We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. Non-compliance with laws and regulations, increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.

Note 10. Stockholders' Equity Common Stock Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,397 million shares and 509 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification).

Customer support and operations

Customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to provide 24-hour call support to our customers, our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform, costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers and other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products.

Customer support and operations costs increased $97 million, or 8%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $157 million, or 14%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in network infrastructure expenses and contractor and employee related expenses to support the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in contractor and employee related expenses to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our Payments Platform.

Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition, business development, advertising, marketing programs, and employee compensation and contractor costs to support these programs.

Sales and marketing expenses increased $159 million, or 16%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $32 million, or 3%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to higher spend on external marketing campaigns and higher employee related expenses. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to higher marketing spend related to Xoom on advertising campaigns intended to enhance our global brand recognition.

Product development

Product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the development of our Payments Platform, new products and the improvement of our existing products. Product development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized. The amortization of developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense.
Product development expenses increased $119 million, or 14%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $42 million, or 5%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses. The increase in

45

Table of Contents

2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses, driven primarily by Xoom, offset by a decrease in contractor related expenses.
General and administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, risk and compliance, executive and other support operations. Our legal expenses, including those related to ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings, settlements, judgments and fines, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.
For the period prior to the separation, our consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with workplace resources and information technology that were previously allocated to the Payments segment of eBay, and additional expenses related to certain corporate functions, including senior management, legal, human resources and finance. These expenses also include allocations related to stock-based compensation. The expenses incurred by eBay were allocated to us based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue, headcount, or other systematic measure. The corporate costs and allocation of expenses from eBay may not be indicative of the expenses that may have been incurred had we been a separate stand-alone entity during the period presented, nor are the results stated herein indicative of the expenses we may incur in the future. Such expenses could be higher or lower. In the period presented prior to the separation, a significant portion of expenses associated with these functions and allocated to us in our consolidated financial statements are included in general and administrative expenses.

General and administrative expenses increased $127 million, or 12%, in 2017 compared to 2016 and increased $155 million, or 18%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2017 was due primarily to an increase in employee related expenses and professional expenses, and continued investments in compliance programs. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in employee expenses, contractor related expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company, and continued investments in compliance programs.

Depreciation and amortization

The primary components of our depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of software, including the amortization of capitalized software and website development costs, amortization of equipment used to deliver our services and the amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $81 million, or 11%, in 2017 compared to 2016, and increased $116 million, or 19%, in 2016 compared to 2015. The increases in 2017 and 2016 were due primarily to additional depreciation expenses associated with investments in our technology platform. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $126 million, $150 million and $93 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles in 2017 was due primarily to lower amortization expense resulting from fully amortized assets. Additionally, the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2017 was partially attributable to an impairment charge of $30 million related to a portion of the acquired customer-related intangible assets. For additional information, see “Note 4—Goodwill and Intangible Assets” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The increase in amortization of intangibles in 2016 was due primarily to our acquisitions completed in 2015.

Restructuring and other charges

Restructuring and other charges consist of restructuring expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio. Restructuring and other charges increased by $132 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to restructuring charges of $40 million and cost adjustments of $92 million related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio.

In the first quarter of 2017, management approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce which was substantially completed by the end of 2017. We recognized $40 million of restructuring expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017. No restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016. In January 2015, at a regular meeting of eBay’s board of directors (the “eBay Board”), the eBay Board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce. The reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses. Restructuring expenses were $48 million in 2015.

Subsequent to the designation as held for sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in November 2017, approximately $92 million related to adjustments to the cost basis, which are primarily driven by charge offs against those loans and interest receivables, were recorded in restructuring and other charges during the year ended December 31, 2017.

Income Tax Expense

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including: a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation; creation of new minimum taxes such as the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax; and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system, which will result in a one time U.S. tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the U.S. (the “Transition Tax”).

In connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we have recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of $180 million in the period ended December 31, 2017. This discrete expense consists of provisional estimates of $1,468 million net expense for the Transition Tax payable in installments over eight years, $1,295 million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, and $7 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets/liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance.

We have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the Tax Act, including the new GILTI and BEAT taxes. Due to the complexity of these new tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the Tax Act and whether such taxes are recorded as a current-period expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes. As a result, we have not included an estimate of the tax expense/benefit related to these items for the period ended December 31, 2017.

Our effective tax rate was 18% in 2017, 14% in 2016, and 17% in 2015. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 was primarily due to discrete net tax expense recorded for U.S. tax reform, partially offset by the adoption of the new stock-based compensation accounting standard in 2017. The decrease in our effective tax rate during 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to favorable discrete tax adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2016 and other separation-related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015. See “Note 17—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.

Non-GAAP Financial Information

Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that create differences between the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K, the following portion of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We present non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparisons of our results between periods. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things; evaluate our operations, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation.

We exclude the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the operation of our business.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.

Table of Contents

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Separation. These are significant expenses related to the separation of our business from eBay into a separate, independent publicly traded company. These consist primarily of third-party consulting fees, legal fees, employee retention payments and other expenses incurred to complete the separation. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Restructuring. These consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. We exclude restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Certain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of our core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. We exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP results because management does not believe they are indicative of our ongoing operating results.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.

In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, we also use free cash flow to assess our performance. Free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, and including investments in our Payments Platform, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period.
