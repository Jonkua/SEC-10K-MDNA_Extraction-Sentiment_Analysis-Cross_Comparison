ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview
DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
The Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants. Of the 37,241 restaurants in 120 countries at year-end 2017, 34,108 were franchised (reflects 21,366 franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,945 licensed to developmental licensees and 5,797 licensed to foreign affiliates ("affiliates")—primarily in Japan and China) and 3,133 were operated by the Company.
Under McDonald's conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide a portion of the capital required by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and décor of their restaurant business, and by reinvesting in the business over time. The Company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for both Company-operated and conventional franchised restaurant sites. This maintains long-term occupancy rights, helps control related costs and assists in alignment with franchisees enabling restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. In certain circumstances, the Company participates in the reinvestment for conventional franchised restaurants in an effort to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives.
Under McDonald's developmental license arrangement, licensees provide capital for the entire business, including the real estate interest, and the Company generally has no capital invested. In addition, the Company has an equity investment in a number of affiliates (primarily in Japan and China) that invest in real estate and operate or franchise restaurants within a market.
McDonald's is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally-relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the financial strength and global experience of McDonald's. However, directly operating restaurants is important to being a credible franchisor and provides Company personnel with restaurant operations experience. In Company-operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, McDonald's further develops and refines operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies, so that only those that the Company believes are most beneficial are introduced in the restaurants. McDonald's continually reviews its mix of Company-operated and franchised restaurants to help optimize overall performance, with a goal to be approximately 95% franchised over the long term.
The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales along with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.
The business is structured into the following segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth, and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance:

- -------------------------------------
• U.S. - the Company's largest segment.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• International Lead Markets - established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and related markets.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• High Growth Markets - markets that the Company believes have relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential including China, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and related markets.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Foundational Markets & Corporate - the remaining markets in the McDonald's system, most of which operate under a largely franchised model. Corporate activities are also reported within this segment.

 For the year ended December 31, 2017, the U.S., International Lead Markets and High Growth Markets accounted for 35%, 32% and 24% of total revenues, respectively.
In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital ("ROIIC"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases most incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents its underlying business trends.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Comparable sales and comparable guest counts are key performance indicators used within the retail industry and are indicative of the impact of the Company’s initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Increases or decreases in comparable sales and comparable guest counts represent the percent change in sales and transactions, respectively, from the same period in the prior year for all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months, including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and, beginning in 2017, also exclude sales from Venezuela due to its hyper-inflation. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Typically, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus

14 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report

depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers (collectively referred to as the "System") is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonald’s is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.

CUSTOMER-CENTRIC GROWTH STRATEGY
Beginning in 2015, the Company made purposeful changes to execute against key elements of its turnaround plan including a renewed focus on running better restaurants, driving operational growth, returning excitement to the brand and enhancing financial value. The Company’s current momentum is broad-based throughout the System and its recent performance demonstrates that McDonald’s has completed the transition from turnaround to growth.
In 2017, the Company shifted its focus to delivering long-term growth through accelerated execution of its customer-centric strategy - the Velocity Growth Plan. This plan outlines actions to drive sustainable guest count growth, a reliable long-term measure of the Company's strength, that is vital to growing sales and shareholder value.
The Velocity Growth Plan is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. The Company is targeting the tremendous opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. The strategy is built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better McDonald’s:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Retaining existing customers - focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the IEO category, including family occasions and food-led breakfast.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Regaining lost customers - recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality, convenience and value.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Converting casual to committed customers - building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the McCafé coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings.

In each pillar, McDonald’s has established sustainable platforms that enable execution of the plan with greater speed, efficiency and impact while remaining relentlessly focused on the fundamentals of running great restaurants. Additionally, through three identified growth accelerators - Experience of the Future (“EOTF”), Digital and Delivery - McDonald’s is enhancing the overall customer experience with hospitable, friendly service and

ever-improving convenience for customers on their terms. The Company met aggressive deployment targets for each one of these accelerators in 2017 and continues further implementation in 2018 and beyond.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Experience of the Future. The Company continues to build upon its investments in EOTF, focusing on restaurant modernization and technology, in order to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance the brand in the eyes of the customer. The modernization efforts are designed to drive incremental customer visits and higher average check. McDonald’s currently has EOTF deployed in about one-third of the restaurants globally, with half of the U.S. restaurants expected to be deployed by the end of 2018.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Digital. As the Company accelerates its pace of converting restaurants to EOTF, it is placing renewed emphasis on improving its existing service model (i.e., eat in, take out, or drive-thru) and strengthening its relationships with customers through technology. By evolving the technology platform, the Company is expanding choices for how customers order, pay and are served through additional functionality on its global mobile app, self-order kiosks and technology-driven models that enable table service and curb-side pick-up. In the U.S. alone, McDonald’s now has over 20 million registered users of the McDonald’s application.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Delivery. The Company continues to further scale its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience customers receive from McDonald's. In 2017, McDonald’s added delivery to 7,000 restaurants in 21 different countries. Including previously offering delivery in Asia and the Middle East, McDonald’s is now delivering meals from over 10,000 restaurants. In addition to added convenience, delivery transactions tend to realize a higher average check and a high customer satisfaction rating. In 2018, while the Company expects to continue to expand the number of restaurants offering delivery, the focus will shift to growing awareness and demand in the areas where delivery is already offered.

In 2018, McDonald’s has plans to raise consumer awareness of the enhanced convenience available with delivery and mobile order and pay through thoughtful marketing campaigns that aim to increase the number of customers enjoying these expanded options to engage with the brand. The Company is optimistic that this will contribute to the continued momentum of the business.
In addition to the customer-relevant changes in the restaurants, the Company has enhanced financial value through its refranchising efforts, G&A cost savings initiatives and cash return to shareholders. In 2017, the Company achieved its target to refranchise 4,000 restaurants, a full year ahead of the original target date. McDonald’s is currently 92% franchised, with a long-term goal of approximately 95%. The transition to a more heavily franchised business model is benefiting the Company’s performance, as the rent and royalty income received from franchisees provides a more predictable and stable revenue stream with significantly lower operating costs and risks. This includes a less G&A and capital intensive structure as franchisees are responsible for supporting and reinvesting in their businesses. Under this more heavily franchised structure, growing comparable sales will be the strongest driver of operating income growth and returns.
Through execution of the Velocity Growth Plan, McDonald’s is serving more customers more often. In 2018, the Company remains aggressively focused on executing its ambitious plan to unlock more of its potential and drive long-term sustainable growth.

McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 15

Our Velocity Growth Plan also includes the Company doing its part to further embed certain social and environmental issues into the core of our business, which we refer to as our Scale for Good.  As one of the world’s largest restaurant companies, our Scale for Good highlights our commitment to global priorities that are consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful progress.  We believe it is important for customers to feel good about visiting McDonald’s restaurants and eating our food in order to continue to drive each of the pillars within our strategy.
While we're committed to addressing many challenges facing society today, we're elevating a few global priorities that reflect analysis of major social and environmental impacts of our food and our business and the material environmental and social issues that matter most to our customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers and stakeholders. Our four global priorities are: beef sustainability, packaging and recycling, commitment to families and our investment in people.  Beyond these global priorities, we will continue to drive progress on our goals and commitments across key social and environmental topics such as climate change, diversity, animal health and welfare, and supporting families and farmers.
2017 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Company's 2017 financial performance demonstrates that the Velocity Growth Plan is working. By focusing on the aforementioned three pillars, and the identified growth accelerators, the Company achieved its best comparable sales performance in six years. In 2017, global comparable sales increased 5.3% and global comparable guest counts increased 1.9%, with positive results achieved in all segments.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 3.6% and comparable guest counts increased 1.0%. The growth in comparable sales and guest counts was supported by the full breadth of our menu, including national beverage value offerings, strong performance of core menu items featured under the McPick 2 platform as well as Signature Crafted premium sandwiches and other menu innovations.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Comparable sales in the International Lead segment increased 5.3% and comparable guest counts increased 2.3%, reflecting positive performance across all of the segment, led by the U.K. and Canada.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the High Growth segment, comparable sales increased 5.3% and comparable guest counts increased 1.8%. This performance reflects positive results across most of the segment, led by China.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Comparable sales in the Foundational Markets increased 9.0% and comparable guest counts increased 3.3%, led by strong performance in Japan and Latin America, as well as solid results across the remainder of the segment.

In addition to improved comparable sales and guest count performance, the Company achieved the following financial results in 2017:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Consolidated revenues decreased 7% (8% in constant currencies) as positive comparable sales were more than offset by the impact of refranchising.

- ----------------------------------------------------------
• Systemwide sales increased 7% (7% in constant currencies).

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Consolidated operating income increased 23% (23% in constant currencies), which benefited from a gain on the sale of the Company’s businesses in China and Hong Kong.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 31.5% in 2016 to 41.9% in 2017.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Diluted earnings per share of $6.37 increased 17% (17% in constant currencies).

- ---------------------------------------------
• Cash provided by operations was $5.6 billion.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Capital expenditures of $1.9 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Across the System, about 900 restaurants (including those in our developmental licensee and affiliated markets) were opened.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------
• Free cash flow was $3.7 billion (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12).

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• One-year ROIIC was 1,671.8% and three-year ROIIC was 93.1% for the period ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the gain from the sale of businesses in China and Hong Kong, as well as significant investing cash inflows from strategic refranchising initiatives, one year and three year ROIIC were 48.3% and 43.6%, respectively (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12).

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 7% to $1.01 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $4.04 per share.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company returned $7.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends for the year.

AREAS OF FOCUS BY SEGMENT

U.S.

The U.S. remains diligent in driving guest count growth momentum in 2018 by continuing to focus on actions that collectively transform the customer experience.
With the launch of the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu in January 2018, the Company is offering a compelling, national value program that resonates with customers. Additionally, an emphasis on food taste and quality will remain a key priority. In 2018, the U.S. is planning to introduce fresh beef across the majority of its restaurants, cooked right when ordered and served hot off the grill for all Quarter Pounder burgers. The U.S. will also offer new seasonal flavors to further expand the McCafé espresso line in 2018, following its successful relaunch of McCafé in 2017.
The pace of activity in the U.S. remains accelerated with a focus on increasing customer awareness of its global mobile application, mobile order and pay functionality as well as its delivery platform. Further, the Company is accelerating its investment in EOTF as it expects to complete nearly 4,000 U.S. restaurants in 2018. A majority of traditional restaurants in the U.S. are expected to be substantially complete with EOTF by the end of 2019, offering a holistic, modern experience for customers.

International Lead Markets

International Lead markets continue to deepen their connection with customers and meet their changing needs with meaningful enhancements in menu, accessibility and experience.
The segment is focused on providing quality, great taste, value and choice across the entire menu. Programs across the segment are energizing the core menu, and every market has successfully extended into premium chicken and beef, in addition to locally relevant offerings. All of this is supported by modernized cooking and service platforms that expand capacity and enable hotter, fresher products. Entry-level value programs appeal to teens and young adults, while other platforms provide budget-conscious customers affordable meal bundles.
International Lead markets remain focused on enhancing and expanding the McCafé coffee brand and the ongoing deployment of EOTF restaurants across the segment. In addition to EOTF, the continued roll out of delivery provides customers with the high levels of convenience they are seeking.

High Growth Markets

McDonald’s High Growth markets have leveraged ideas around design, digital, people, menu innovation and value from other markets to enhance the customer experience.
Driving operational growth in existing restaurants and targeted new restaurant development are top priorities. In 2017, the Company sold its businesses in China and Hong Kong to a licensee. Continued successful integration of the segment’s new licensee into the System will further enable restaurant growth, menu innovation and convenience strategies suited to each market’s customers.

Foundational Markets

Foundational markets are a diverse group that share the common goal of enhancing critical elements that differentiate McDonald’s - the menu and the customer experience. The segment is committed to running great restaurants and increasing convenience to customers, including drive-thru and delivery.

OUTLOOK
2018 Outlook
The following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company’s future results.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion, and the potential impacts of hyper-inflation. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1 percentage point to 2018 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies).

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company does not generally provide specific guidance on changes in comparable sales. However, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure, a 1 percentage point change in comparable sales for either the U.S. or the International Lead segment would change annual diluted earnings per share by about 5 to 6 cents.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the guidance issued in Accounting Standards Codification 606, "Revenue Recognition - Revenue from Contracts with Customers". This standard changed the way initial fees from franchisees for new restaurant openings or new franchise terms are recognized. Under the new guidance, initial franchise fees will be recognized evenly over the franchise term. The Company expects the adoption of this guidance to negatively impact 2018 consolidated franchised revenues and franchised margins by approximately $50 million.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• With about 75% of McDonald's grocery bill comprised of 10 different commodities, a basket of goods approach is the most comprehensive way to look at the Company's commodity costs. For the full-year 2018, costs for the total basket of goods are expected to increase about 1% to 2% in the U.S. and increase about 2% in the International Lead segment.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company expects full-year 2018 selling, general and administrative expenses to decrease about 1% in constant currencies.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full-year 2018 to increase about 5% to 7% compared with 2017 due primarily to higher average debt balances.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 70% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 30 cents.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full-year 2018 to be in the 25-27% range, with volatility between the quarters. Certain aspects of the Tax Act are expected to be clarified, and as such, could impact the Company's tax rate.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company expects capital expenditures for 2018 to be approximately $2.4 billion. About $1.5 billion will be dedicated to our U.S. business, primarily focused on accelerating the pace of EOTF. We expect to complete EOTF at nearly 4,000 additional U.S. restaurants in 2018,

McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 17

resulting in about half of the total U.S. restaurants modernized by the end of 2018. Of the remaining capital, about half will be dedicated to new restaurant openings and the remainder will be allocated to reinvestment in continued expansion of EOTF around the world. The Company’s capital will contribute towards about 250 restaurant openings, while developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute capital towards the opening of approximately 750 restaurants, for a total of about 1,000 expected restaurant openings in 2018. The Company expects net additions of about 600 restaurants in 2018.
Long-Term Outlook

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company expects to realize net annual G&A savings of about $500 million from its G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. Through the end of 2017, the Company realized cumulative savings of about $300 million and expects to fully realize its targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company expects an incremental cash flow benefit of $400 to $500 million annually as a result of the Tax Act, prior to any reinvestment.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company expects to return about $24 billion to shareholders over the three-year period ending 2019. As the business grows, the Company also expects to modestly increase its debt levels, while maintaining its credit metrics within current ranges.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Beginning in 2019, the Company expects to achieve the following long-term, average annual (constant currency) financial targets:

- --------------------------------
◦ Systemwide sales growth of 3-5%;

- --------------------------------------
◦ Operating margin in the mid-40% range;

- --------------------------------------------------------
◦ Earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and

- ---------------------------
◦ ROIIC in the mid-20% range.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS
While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows.
In 2017, results reflected the stronger Euro, offset by the weaker British Pound. In 2016 and 2015, results were negatively impacted by weaker foreign currencies.

NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
In 2017, net income increased 11% (11% in constant currencies) to $5.2 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 17% (17% in constant currencies) to $6.37. Foreign currency translation had no impact on diluted earnings per share.
In 2016, net income increased 3% (6% in constant currencies) to $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 13% (16% in constant currencies) to $5.44. Foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $0.11 on diluted earnings per share.
Results in 2017 reflected stronger operating performance, G&A savings and improved performance in Japan, which enabled the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan. 2017 results included approximately $700 million of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act, reflecting provisional amounts related to the deemed repatriation charge of approximately $1.2 billion, partly offset by a benefit of approximately $500 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities

to the lower enacted U.S. corporate tax rate of 21%. In addition to the $0.82 per share of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act, 2017 results included a net benefit of $0.53 per share consisting of an approximate $850 million gain on the sale of the Company’s businesses in China and Hong Kong, offset in part by $150 million of current year restructuring and non-cash impairment charges in connection with the Company’s global G&A and refranchising initiatives. Excluding the above items, as well as $342 million of prior year strategic charges, net income was $5.4 billion, an increase of 10% (10% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share was $6.66, an increase of 16% (16% in constant currencies).
 Results in 2016 benefited from stronger operating performance and higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses, mostly in the U.S. Results in 2016 included $342 million, or $0.28 per share, of strategic charges.

McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 19

The Company repurchased 31.4 million shares of its stock for $4.6 billion in 2017 and 92.3 million shares of its stock for $11.1 billion in 2016, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.

REVENUES
The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, minimum rent payments and initial fees. Revenues from franchised restaurants that are licensed to foreign affiliates and developmental licensees include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees.
Between 2015 and 2017, the Company accelerated the pace of refranchising to optimize its restaurant ownership mix, generate more stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams, and operate with a less resource-intensive structure. The shift to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants negatively impacts consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised sales, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percentage of sales.
In 2017, revenues decreased 7% (8% in constant currencies) and in 2016, revenues decreased 3% (flat in constant currencies). For both periods, the decreases in revenues were due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by positive comparable sales.

• International Lead Markets: In 2017, the increase in revenues was due to strong performance in the U.K. and Canada as well as positive comparable sales across all markets, partly offset by the impact of refranchising. In 2016, the decrease in revenues was due to the impact of refranchising, partly offset by strong comparable sales growth across most of the segment.

• High Growth Markets: In 2017, the decrease in revenues reflected the impact of refranchising the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong, partly offset by positive comparable sales across most markets. In 2016, revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency translation. In constant currencies, 2016 revenues increased due to positive comparable sales growth in China and most other markets, and expansion in Russia.

FRANCHISED MARGINS
Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the Company’s occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. Franchised margin dollars represented about 80% of the combined restaurant margins in 2017 and about 75% of the combined restaurant margins in 2016 and 2015.
In 2017, franchised margin dollars increased $703 million or 9% (9% in constant currencies). In 2016, franchised margin dollars increased $331 million or 5% (6% in constant currencies). For both 2017 and 2016, the constant currency increases were due to positive comparable sales performance, refranchising and expansion.

• U.S.: In 2017 and 2016, the decrease in the franchised margin percent was primarily due to higher depreciation costs related to EOTF and restaurant modernization, partly offset by positive comparable sales.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• International Lead Markets: In 2017 and 2016, the increases in the franchised margin percent reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales performance, partly offset by the impact of refranchising and higher occupancy costs.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• High Growth Markets: In 2017, the increase in the franchised margin percent was due to the impact of refranchising, largely related to the China and Hong Kong transaction, and strong comparable sales performance. In 2016, the decrease was primarily due to the impact of refranchising and higher occupancy costs, partly offset by the benefit of positive comparable sales performance.

The franchised margin percent in Foundational Markets & Corporate is higher relative to the other segments due to a larger proportion of developmental licensed and affiliated restaurants where the Company receives royalty income with no corresponding occupancy costs.

COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINS
Company-operated margin dollars represent sales by Company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. In 2017, Company-operated margin dollars decreased $287 million or 11% (12% in constant currencies). In 2016, Company-operated margin dollars increased $85 million or 3% (7% in constant currencies).

• U.S.: In 2017, the Company-operated margin percent decreased as strong comparable sales were offset by higher commodity and labor costs as well as additional depreciation costs related to EOTF. In 2016, the increase was due to a higher average check and lower commodity costs, partly offset by the impact of negative guest counts and higher labor costs.

• High Growth Markets: In 2017, the increase in the Company-operated margin percent was primarily due to strong comparable sales and the benefit of lower depreciation in China and Hong Kong. This increase was partly offset by negative comparable sales in South Korea and the impact of refranchising. In 2016, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales and improved restaurant profitability in China, which benefited from value-added tax ("VAT") reform, partly offset by higher labor costs across the segment.

SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 6% (7% in constant currencies) in 2017 and decreased 2% (1% in constant currencies) in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was due to lower employee-related costs, partly offset by higher restaurant technology spending. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to lower employee-related costs, mostly offset by higher incentive-based compensation expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales was 2.5% in 2017, 2.8% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015. Management believes that analyzing selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business.
In connection with our turnaround plan, the Company established a net selling, general and administrative savings target of $500 million from its G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. The Company expects to fully realize its targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019.

• Equity in (earnings) losses of unconsolidated affiliates

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates improved in 2017 and 2016 mainly due to improved performance in Japan. 2017 results also benefited from the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan.

- --------------------------------------------------
• Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net

In 2017, results benefited due to a property disposition gain in Australia. In 2015, results included a gain of $135 million on the strategic sale of a unique restaurant property in the U.S., mostly offset by asset write-offs of $72 million resulting from the decision to close under-performing restaurants, primarily in the U.S. and China.

- -----------------------------------------
• Impairment and other charges (gains), net

In 2017, results reflected the gain on the Company's sale of its businesses in China and Hong Kong of approximately $850 million, partly offset by $111 million of unrelated non-cash impairment charges. The results for all three years included restructuring and impairment charges related to the Company's global refranchising and G&A initiatives.

In addition, results benefited from lower depreciation expense in China and Hong Kong, and also includes the gain on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong as well as unrelated non-cash impairment charges. Excluding these items, operating income increased 17% (15% in constant currencies). In 2016, the increase was driven primarily by improved restaurant profitability in China.

• Foundational Markets and Corporate: In 2017, the constant currency operating income increase reflected the Company's refranchising initiatives, higher G&A costs at the Corporate level due to restaurant technology expenditures, and improved performance in Japan, which enabled the reversal of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset in Japan. Results also reflected the benefit from comparison to the prior year's strategic charges. In 2016, the increase reflected Japan's strong performance, partly offset by the net impact of the current and prior year impairment and restructuring charges from the Company's global refranchising and restructuring initiatives.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the reported effective income tax rates were 39.4%, 31.7% and 30.9%, respectively.
The increase in the tax rate for 2017 reflects provisional amounts related to the deemed repatriation charge of approximately $1.2 billion, partly offset by a benefit of approximately $500 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted U.S. corporate tax rate of 21% under the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate would have been 31.6%.
Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion in 2017 and $2.0 billion in 2016. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.

----------

Cash Flows

The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.
Cash provided by operations totaled $5.6 billion and free cash flow was $3.7 billion in 2017, while cash provided by operations totaled $6.1 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion in 2016. The Company's free cash flow conversion rate was 71% in 2017, and 90% in 2016 (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). In 2017, cash provided by operations decreased by $508 million or 8% compared with 2016, as improved operating results were more than offset by higher income tax payments in the U.S. and other working capital changes. In 2016, cash provided by operations decreased $480 million or 7% compared with 2015, primarily due to higher income tax payments primarily outside the U.S. and other working capital changes, partly offset by higher net income.
Cash provided by investing activities totaled $562 million in 2017, an increase of $1.5 billion compared with 2016. The increase is primarily due to proceeds associated with the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong. Cash used for investing activities totaled $982 million in 2016, a decrease of $438 million compared with 2015. The decrease primarily reflected higher proceeds from sales of restaurant businesses.
Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.3 billion in 2017, a decrease of $6 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to lower treasury stock purchases, partly offset by a decrease in net borrowings. Cash used for financing activities totaled $11.3 billion in 2016, an increase of $12.0 billion compared with 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings and higher treasury stock purchases.
The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $2.5 billion and $1.2 billion at year end 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.
RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
In 2017, the Company opened 929 restaurants and closed 587 restaurants. In 2016, the Company opened 896 restaurants and closed 522 restaurants. The Company closes restaurants for a variety of reasons, such as existing sales and profit performance or loss of real estate tenure.

More than 90% of the restaurants at year-end 2017 were franchised, including 94% in the U.S., 87% in International Lead Markets, 81% in High Growth Markets and 98% in Foundational Markets.
Capital expenditures were relatively flat in 2017 as higher expenditures on restaurant reinvestment were offset by fewer restaurant openings that required the Company's capital. Under McDonald's developmental licensee and affiliate arrangements, licensees provide capital for the entire business and the Company generally has no capital invested. Capital expenditures in 2016 were essentially flat with 2015, primarily due to higher

reinvestment related to reimages, offset by fewer new restaurant openings.
Capital expenditures invested in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets represented over 90% of the total in 2017, 2016 and 2015.

(1) Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures

New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, and leveraging best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $3.9 million in 2017.
The Company owned 45% to 50% of the land and 70% to 75% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end 2017 and 2016.
SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS
For 2017 through 2019, the Company expects to return about $24 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, subject to business and market conditions. In 2017, the Company returned approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid.

In December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $15 billion share repurchase program with no specified expiration date ("2016 Program"). In July 2017, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2016 Program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective July 28, 2017, that authorizes the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date. In 2017, approximately 31.4 million shares were repurchased for $4.7 billion, of which approximately 17.3 million shares or $2.7 billion were repurchased under the new program.
The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 42 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2017 full-year dividend of $3.83 per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $0.94 per share, with an increase to $1.01 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 7% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a

McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 25

$4.04 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.

----------------------------------------

Financial Position and Capital Resources

TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS
Total assets increased $2.8 billion or 9% in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and an increase in cash and equivalents, partly offset by the impact of refranchising. Approximately 85% of total assets were in the U.S., International Lead markets and High Growth markets at year-end 2017. Net property and equipment increased $1.2 billion in 2017, primarily due to capital expenditures and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partly offset by depreciation and the impact of refranchising. Net property and equipment represented about 65% of total assets at year-end.
Operating income and month-end asset balances are used to compute return on average assets. For the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015, return on average assets was 29.0%, 23.0% and 20.9%, respectively.
In 2017, return on average assets increased primarily due to higher operating income, which included the gain on the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong. In 2016, return on average assets increased due to higher operating income and lower average assets. Operating income does not include interest income; however, cash balances are included in average assets. The inclusion of cash balances in average assets reduced return on average assets by about three percentage points for all years presented.

FINANCING AND MARKET RISK
The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2017 totaled $29.5 billion, compared with $26.0 billion at December 31, 2016. The net increase in 2017 was primarily due to net long-term issuances of $3.1 billion.

Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s currently rate, with a stable outlook, the Company’s commercial paper A-2 and P-2, respectively; and its long-term debt BBB+ and Baa1, respectively. To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings.
Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Under existing authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors, at December 31, 2017, the Company had $15.0 billion of authority remaining to borrow funds, including through (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has     $2.5 billion available under a committed line of credit agreement as well as authority to issue commercial paper in the U.S. and global markets (see Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements). Debt maturing in 2018 is $1.8 billion of long-term corporate debt. The Company plans to issue long-term debt to refinance this maturing debt. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's subsidiaries also had $268 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.
The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.

26 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report

In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $12.4 billion and $8.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.
The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2017, the Company was required to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's counterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.
The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:
Foreign currency net asset exposures

Russian Ruble 563 470

The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2017 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2017 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.
LIQUIDITY
The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where we earn about 60% of our operating income. A significant portion

of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of our international operations.
The Company's cash and equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2017.
Consistent with prior years, we expect existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, annual repatriation of a portion of the current period's foreign earnings, and the issuance of domestic debt to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating, investing, and financing activities. We also continue to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating, investing, and financing activities.
As a result of the Tax Act, the Company expects an incremental cash flow benefit of $400 to $500 million annually due to a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% partly offset by a $1.2 billion 2017 tax cost on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be paid over the next 8 years.
In the future, should we require more capital to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, we could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
The Company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. In addition, the Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise arrangements) along with the Company’s borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the Company under existing franchise arrangements as of December 31, 2017. See discussions of cash flows and financial position and capital resources as well as the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Debt obligations do not include the impact of noncash fair value hedging adjustments, deferred debt costs, and accrued interest.

In the U.S., the Company maintains certain supplemental benefit plans that allow participants to (i) make tax-deferred contributions and (ii) receive Company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the qualified benefit plans because of Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") limitations. At December 31, 2017, total liabilities for the supplemental plans were $484 million.
At December 31, 2017, total liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.2 billion. In addition, a liability of approximately $1.2 billion was recorded in 2017 resulting from the

McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report 27

Tax Act, which imposed a deemed repatriation tax on the Company's undistributed foreign earnings. This tax liability will be paid over eight years beginning in 2018.
There are certain purchase commitments that are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements and are primarily related to construction, inventory, energy, marketing and other service related arrangements that occur in the normal course of business.  Such commitments are generally shorter term in nature, will be funded from operating cash flows, and are not significant to the Company’s overall financial position.

Other Matters

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:

- ----------------------
• Property and equipment

Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. The Company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. If there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment, or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write-offs in future periods.

- ------------------------
• Businesses Held for Sale

Assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of balances related to businesses in China and Hong Kong. In December 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an agreement for the Company to sell its existing businesses in China and Hong Kong to a licensee. Based on this approval, the Company concluded that these markets were “held for sale” as of December 31, 2016 in accordance with the requirements of ASC 360 “Property, Plant and Equipment”. The Company completed the sale of these businesses on July 31, 2017.

- ------------------------
• Share-based compensation

The Company has a share-based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock units ("RSUs") to employees and nonemployee directors. The expense for these equity-based incentives is based on their fair value at date of grant

and generally amortized over their vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period.
The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model requires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility of the Company’s stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to determine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will fluctuate in future years. The fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant less the present value of expected dividends over the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs granted beginning in 2016, the Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return ("TSR") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.

- -----------------------------------
• Long-lived assets impairment review

Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, the Company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. These estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges. Based on the annual goodwill impairment test, conducted in the fourth quarter, approximately 5-10% of goodwill may be at risk of future impairment as the fair values of certain reporting units were not substantially in excess of their carrying amounts.

- -------------------
• Litigation accruals

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after
careful analysis of each matter. The required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. The Company does not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

- ------------
• Income taxes

The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. While the Company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies, including the sale of appreciated assets, in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. This could result in a

28 McDonald's Corporation 2017 Annual Report

charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.
The Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. The most significant new developments in 2017 and 2016 are described below.
In 2017 and 2016, the Company increased the balance of unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior years by $144 million and $150 million, respectively. These increases primarily resulted from the evaluation of new information during the progression of tax audits in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions. As a result of this new information, the Company changed its judgment on the measurement of the related unrecognized tax benefits and recorded an increase in the gross unrecognized tax benefits. See the Income Taxes footnote in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the related tax reconciliations.
In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing adjustments related to the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with the IRS Appeals Office related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest, and, as of December 31, 2017, is awaiting scheduling of an opening conference with IRS Appeals. The Company expects resolution on these issues in either 2018 or 2019.
In 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. Although at December 31, 2017 the IRS had not yet issued its RAR for these years, when issued it is expected to result in the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Consequently, it is expected that the transfer pricing matters for 2011 and 2012 will be addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeal, such that resolution is expected in either 2018 or 2019.
In December 2015, the European Commission opened a formal investigation directly with the Luxembourg government to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and the Company may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. As of December 31, 2017, no decision has been published with respect to this investigation.
While the Company cannot predict the ultimate resolution of the aforementioned tax matters, we believe that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate as determined in accordance with Topic 740 - Income Taxes of the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”).
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2017, the Company has not completed the accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act. However, as described below, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For these items, a provisional net tax cost of approximately $700 million is recognized and is included as a component of provision for income taxes from continuing operations.

Provisional amounts
Deferred tax assets and liabilities: The Company remeasured certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining the calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. A provisional amount was recorded related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balance, resulting in a provision for income taxes benefit of approximately $500 million.
Foreign tax effects: The one-time transition tax is based on the total post-1986 earnings and profits ("E&P") that the Company had previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. A provisional amount was recorded for the one-time transition tax liability, resulting in a provision for income taxes cost of approximately $1.2 billion. The Company has not yet completed the calculation of the total post-1986 foreign E&P. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when the calculation of post-1986 foreign E&P and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets are finalized. Additionally, the provisional amount includes an estimate of foreign withholding taxes related to the E&P subject to the transition tax. A provisional deferred tax liability has been recorded for temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures. However, the Company is still evaluating how the Tax Act will affect the Company’s accounting position related to the indefinite reinvestment of unremitted foreign earnings. During the measurement period, the Company may reflect adjustments to this provisional amount upon obtaining, preparing, and analyzing the necessary information to complete the accounting under ASC 740.
EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES—INFLATION
The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. This ability is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the reported effective income tax rates were 39.4%, 31.7% and 30.9%, respectively.
The increase in the tax rate for 2017 reflects provisional amounts related to the deemed repatriation charge of approximately $1.2 billion, partly offset by a benefit of approximately $500 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower enacted U.S. corporate tax rate of 21% under the Tax Act. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective income tax rate would have been 31.6%.
Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1.5 billion in 2017 and $2.0 billion in 2016. Substantially all of the net tax assets are expected to be realized in the U.S. and other profitable markets.
