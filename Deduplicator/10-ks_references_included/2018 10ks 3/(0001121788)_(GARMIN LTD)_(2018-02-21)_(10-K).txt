Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations focuses on and is intended to clarify the results of our operations,
certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the
consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified
by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including
the notes thereto), the description of our business, all as set forth in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed
above in Item 1A.

As previously noted,
the discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Form 10-K, contain statements concerning potential future
events. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as “expects,”
“anticipates,” “believes” or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. If any of our assumptions
on which the statements are based prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results could
materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of
factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those discussed above in Item 1A. Readers are strongly
encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any such forward-looking statement. Except as may be required by law, we
do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.

Garmin’s fiscal year
is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Fiscal year 2017 contains 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks
for 2016 and 52 weeks for 2015. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company’s fiscal year and fiscal
periods. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to "we," "us," "our"
and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

Unless otherwise indicated,
dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.

Overview

We are a leading worldwide
provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS,
technology. We operate in five business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor, fitness, auto, and aviation markets. Our segments
offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors. However, the nature of
products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately.

Since our first products
were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Garmin’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin’s consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The presentation of
these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its
estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments,
intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. Garmin bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

For information on each of the following critical
accounting policies and/or estimates, refer to the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated

Accounting Terms and Characteristics

Net Sales

Our net sales are primarily
generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers. Refer to
the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our sales are largely of a consumer nature;
therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results. We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders
we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.

Net sales are subject to
seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during
the holiday buying season, and in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season. Our aviation
and auto OEM products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications
and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Cost of
Sales/Gross Profit

Raw material costs are
our most significant component of cost of goods sold. Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products
in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage
lower cost components. We believe that our flexible production model allows our Xizhi, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants
in Taiwan; Yangzhou manufacturing plant in China; and our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants in the U.S. to
experience relatively low costs of manufacturing. In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan and China than in Olathe and Salem.

Sales price variability
has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit. In the past, prices of our devices sold into the auto market
have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points. In recent years, pricing has
stabilized in auto allowing for relatively stable gross margins excluding the impact of deferred revenues and costs. The average
selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the
introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices. The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix
of products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.

 42

Advertising Expense

Our advertising expenses
consist of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses
consist primarily of:

 · salaries for sales, marketing and product support personnel;

 · salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel;

 · marketing, and other brand building costs;

 · accounting and legal costs;

 · information systems and infrastructure costs;

 · travel and related costs; and

 · occupancy and other overhead costs.

Research and Development

The majority of our research
and development costs represent salaries for our engineers and costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype
development.

We are committed to increasing
the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer
and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products.

Income Taxes

We have experienced a relatively
low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory
rates. In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership
of our consumer products have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate tax rate.

Results of Operations

The following table sets
forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):

In 2016, the Company moved
action camera related revenue and expenses from the outdoor segment to the auto segment, allowing for alignment and synergies with
other camera-based efforts occurring within the auto segment. The overall impact of the move was immaterial. However, action camera
related operating results for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015 has been recast to conform to the 2017 and 2016 presentation.

The following table sets
forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown. For each line item
in the table the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included
in Item 6.

Net sales increased 2%
in 2017 when compared to the year-ago period. Outdoor, marine, and aviation segments had an increase in revenue, while fitness
and auto segments had a decrease in revenue. Fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix at 25% in 2017,
which was a slight decline from 27% in 2016. Auto revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2016 at 29% and
declined to 24% in 2017.

Total unit sales decreased
8% to 15.4 million units in the 52-weeks ended 2017 from 16.8 million units in the 53-weeks ended 2016.

 45

Auto segment revenue decreased
15% from the year-ago period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction. Fitness segment revenue decreased 7% from the
year-ago period, primary driven by the general decline of the basic activity tracker market. Outdoor, marine, and aviation revenues
increased 28%, 13%, and 14%, respectively when compared to the year-ago period. Growth in outdoor was driven by growth in our wearables
and subscriptions categories. Our marine segment revenue increased primarily due to growth in chartplotters, fishfinders, and entertainment
systems, and the newly acquired Navionics. Aviation revenues increased due to growth in both OEM and aftermarket sales.

Cost of Goods Sold

Auto 422,662 56 % 493,811 56 % (71,149 ) -14 %
Aviation 129,754 26 % 109,943 25 % 19,811 18 %
Total $ 1,303,840 42 % $ 1,339,095 44 % $ (35,255 ) -3 %

Cost of goods sold decreased
3% in absolute dollars for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 when compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.

The auto segment cost of
goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline. In the outdoor, fitness, and marine segments, the decrease
in cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues was a result of a shift in product mix toward higher margin products. The aviation
segment increase in cost of goods sold was generally consistent with the segment revenue increase.

Gross Profit

Total $ 1,783,164 58 % $ 1,679,570 56 % $ 103,594 6 %

Gross profit dollars in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 increased 6% while gross profit margin increased
210 basis points compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016. Growth in sales of higher margin segments contributed to the
increase in gross profit dollars and gross margin percentage. Outdoor, fitness, and marine segment increases to gross profit margin
were primarily due to product mix within those segments. Auto and aviation segment gross margin rates were relatively consistent
between fiscal periods.

Advertising expense decreased
7% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 compared to the
53-weeks ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to decreases in spend on media advertising.

Selling, general and administrative
expense increased 7% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017
compared to the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016. The absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to legal-related costs
and information technology costs. As a percent of revenues, selling, general, and administrative expenses in all segments except
marine were relatively consistent on a year over year basis. The increase in the marine segment, as a percent of revenues, was
primarily related to a litigation settlement.

Research and development
expense increased 9% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of engineering personnel throughout
the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017. In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $43.7 million when compared
with the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, and increased 100 basis points as a percent of revenue. Our research and development
spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.

Total $ 668,860 22 % $ 623,909 21 % $ 44,951 7 %

As a result of the
above, operating income increased 7% in absolute dollars and 100 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the
53-weeks ended December 31, 2016. The growth in operating income, both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue, was
primarily due to an increase in revenue growth and increase in gross margin percentage, which was partially offset by
increased operating expenses, as discussed above.

Other Income (Expense)

 52-weeks ended 53-weeks ended
------------------------------- ----------------- ------- - ----------------- - ------- -
 December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016
Interest income $ 36,925 $ 33,406
Foreign currency gains (losses) (22,579 ) (31,651 )
Other (912 ) 4,006
Total $ 13,434 $ 5,761

The average returns on
cash and investments, including interest and capital gain/loss returns, during the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 and the 53-
weeks ended December 31, 2016 were 1.5% for both periods. Interest income increased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to slightly
higher yields on fixed-income securities, while other income decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher net capital gains
realized in fiscal 2016.

Foreign currency gains
and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation
to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency
of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions
and balances are denominated in British Pounds. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss
is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the
functional currency at a given legal entity. Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the
Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The $22.6 million currency
loss recognized in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset
by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2017, the U.S. Dollar weakened 9.4%
against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $55.9 million, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 14.1% against the Euro and 9.5%
against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $27.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively. The remaining net currency
gain of $3.0 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

The $31.7 million currency
loss recognized in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar and the strengthening
of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.7% against the Taiwan
Dollar, resulting in a loss of $9.2 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.2% against the Euro and 16.8% against the British
Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $13.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The remaining net currency loss of $4.4 million
is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

Income Tax Provision

Our income tax benefit
for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 was $12.7 million compared to income tax expense of $118.9 million for the 53-weeks ended
December 31, 2016, resulting in a net change of $131.6 million. Contributing to the decrease in tax expense was:

 · Income tax benefit of $180.0 million related to the Company’s Switzerland corporate tax election in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 with no comparable item in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016,

Partially offset by:

 · Income tax expense of $19.9 million related to share based compensation in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 in accordance with new accounting standard Topic 718, Compensation–Stock Compensation, and

 · Increased income tax expense of $21.0 million related to the Company’s election to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions in the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017.

On December 22, 2017, the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed by United States Congress, reducing the United States federal corporate income tax rate from 35%
to 21%. The effects of U.S. tax reform, including revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, had an immaterial impact on
the 2017 income tax benefit, on a provisional basis, as discussed in Note 6.

Net Income

As a result of the various
factors noted above, net income increased 36% to $695.0 million for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 compared to $510.8 million
for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016.

Total $ 3,018,665 100 % $ 2,820,270 100 % $ 198,395 7 %

Net sales increased 7% in 2016 when compared to the prior year period. All segments had an increase in
revenue except for auto. Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 29% in the 53-weeks ended December 31,
2016 compared to 38% in the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.

Total unit sales increased
4% to 16.8 million units in 2016 from 16.2 million units in 2015.

Auto segment revenue decreased 17% from the prior year period, primarily due to the ongoing PND market
contraction. Outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation revenues increased 33%, 24%, 16%, and 10%, respectively, when compared to the
prior year period, primarily due to increases in sales volumes. Growth in outdoor was driven by wearables and the newly acquired
DeLorme product lines. The increase in fitness was driven by wearables with Garmin ElevateTM wrist heart rate technology.
Our marine segment increased due to growth in chartplotters, fishfinders, and entertainment systems. Aviation revenues increased
due to growth in both OEM and aftermarket sales.

Total $ 1,339,095 44 % $ 1,281,566 45 % $ 57,529 4 %

Cost of goods sold increased
4% in absolute dollars for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 when compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.

In the auto segment, the
cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline. In the outdoor and fitness segments, the increases
of 32% and 29% in cost of goods sold, respectively, primarily reflect strong volume growth. In the marine and aviation segments,
the increases of 16% and 6%, respectively, primarily reflect volume growth.

Gross profit dollars in
the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 increased 9% while gross profit margin increased 100 basis points compared to the 52-weeks
ended December 26, 2015. Growth in sales of higher margin segments contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars and gross
margin percentage. Fitness margin declined to 53% due to product mix. All other segment gross margin rates are relatively consistent
between fiscal periods.

6% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to the
52-weeks ended December 26, 2015. The increase in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to outdoor and fitness, partially
offset by auto.

Selling, general and administrative
expense increased 4% and was relatively flat as a percent of revenues in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 52-weeks
ended December 26, 2015. The absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to information technology costs and salaries and
benefits. Variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based
on percentage of total revenues with the exception of the marine segment, as expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue due
to prior year specific litigation matters.

Research and development
expense increased 10% due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout the
53-weeks ended December 31, 2016. In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $40.9 million when compared with
the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015, and increased 40 basis points as a percent of revenue. Our research and development spending
is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.

As a result of the above,
operating income increased 14% in absolute dollars and 120 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the 52-weeks ended
December 26, 2015. Revenue growth with a slight increase in gross margin percentage contributed to the growth, slightly offset
by increased operating expenses, as discussed above, with the exception of the marine segment, as operating expenses decreased
as a percentage of revenue due to prior year specific litigation matters.

Other Income (Expense)

 53-weeks ended 52-weeks ended
------------------------------- ----------------- ------- - ----------------- - ------- -
 December 31, 2016 December 26, 2015
Interest income $ 33,406 $ 29,653
Foreign currency gains (losses) (31,651 ) (23,465 )
Other 4,006 11,418
Total $ 5,761 $ 17,606

The average returns on
cash and investments, including interest and capital gain/loss returns, during the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 and the 52-weeks
ended December 26, 2015 were 1.5% and 1.2%, respectively. Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on
fixed-income securities.

Foreign currency gains
and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation
to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency
of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions
and balances are denominated in British Pounds. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss
is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the
functional currency at a given legal entity. Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the
Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The $31.7 million currency
loss in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar and the strengthening of the
U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened 1.7% against the Taiwan Dollar,
resulting in a loss of $9.2 million, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.2% against the Euro and 16.8% against the British Pound
Sterling, resulting in losses of $13.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The remaining net currency loss of $4.4 million
was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

The $23.5 million currency
loss in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, partially
offset by a gain associated with the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Taiwan Dollar. During fiscal 2015, the U.S. Dollar
strengthened 10.0% against the Euro and 4.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $31.2 million and $2.1
million, respectively. This was largely offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening 3.8% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a
gain of $19.5 million. The remaining net currency loss of $9.7 million was related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

During the 53-weeks ended
December 31, 2016, Garmin recorded other income of $4.0 million compared to $11.4 million in the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.
The decrease in fiscal 2016 relates primarily to a legal settlement received in fiscal 2015.

Income Tax Provision

Our income tax expense
increased by $7.9 million, to $118.9 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, from $111.0 million for the 52-weeks ended
December 26, 2015.  Contributing to the increase was:

 · Increased income before taxes in the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015,

Partially offset by:

 · A net release of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations of $11.9 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016, as compared with $7.3 million for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.

Net Income

As a result of the various
factors noted above, net income increased 12% to $510.8 million for the 53-weeks ended December 31, 2016 compared to $456.2 million
for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2015.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 30, 2017, we had $2,313.2 million
of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash
requirements will be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, fund share
repurchases, and fund strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be
sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.

It is management’s goal to invest the
on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors of each applicable Garmin
entity holding the cash. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of
liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and
investments during fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 were approximately 1.6%, 1.5%, and 1.2%, respectively. The fair value of our securities
varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit
performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 3 for additional information regarding marketable securities.

The $44.8 million decrease
in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to a decrease of cash
provided by working capital of $133.2 million (which included increases of $52.2 million in accounts receivable and $31.5 million
in cash paid for inventory) and income taxes payable of $16.5 million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net
income of $184.1 million, reduced by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $79.3 million.

The $425.2 million increase
in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to an increase in cash
provided by working capital of $223.5 million (which included decreases of $122.5 million in cash paid for inventory and $109.6
million in cash paid for prepaid royalties and other assets) and income taxes payable of $154.0 million, primarily attributable
to cash taxes paid related to a 2015 intercompany restructuring. The increase was also impacted by an increase of net income of
$54.6 million, reduced by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $6.9 million.

The $73.0 million increase
in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to increased cash payments
for net purchases of property and equipment of $49.1 million and net cash paid for acquisitions of $12.5 million.

The $9.6 million increase
in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to increased net cash paid
for acquisitions of $39.3 million and net purchases of property and equipment of $17.6 million, partially offset by an increase
of $49.0 million in net redemptions of marketable securities.

We have budgeted approximately
$140 million to $150 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 to include some facility expansion, along with normal ongoing
capital expenditures and maintenance activities. Approximately half of the budgeted capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are attributable
to Olathe, KS facilities, including the expansion project described in “Item 2. Properties.”

The $113.3 million decrease
in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to decreased dividend payments
of $98.5 million associated with an additional payment made in the 53-week fiscal year 2016 and a decrease of purchases of treasury
stock of $18.7 million under our share repurchase authorization.

The $61.6 million increase
in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to increased dividend payments
of $103.3 million associated with an additional payment made in the 53-week fiscal year 2016 and the year-over-year increase of
our dividend rate, partially offset by a decrease of purchases of treasury stock of $38.2 million under our share repurchase authorization.

Our declared dividend has
increased from $0.48 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2014 to $0.51 per share for the twelve calendar
quarters beginning in June 2015.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments

As of December 30, 2017,
operating leases comprise the substance of the Company’s commercial commitments with long-term scheduled payments, as summarized
below:

 Payments due by period
----------------------- ---------------------- ------ ---------------- - ------ --------- - --------- ----------------- ------ - ------
Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years
Operating Leases $ 82,210 $ 17,572 $ 25,777 $ 17,255 $ 21,606

The Company is party to
certain other commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, and other indirect purchases in
connection with conducting our business.  The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December
30, 2017 was approximately $313.4 million. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual
obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders
are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time.

We may be required to make
significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows
associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement,
if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $130.8 million as of December 30, 2017,
have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits,
see Note 2, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.
