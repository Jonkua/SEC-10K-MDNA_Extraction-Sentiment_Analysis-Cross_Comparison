Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a discussion of our pension and other postretirement plans’ exposure to interest rate risks. Also see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for details on how economic conditions affecting market risks also affect the demand for and pricing of our products and how we are affected by exchange rate fluctuations.
Foreign Exchange. The more we expand our business outside the United States, the more our financial results will be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. This exposure includes sales of our products in currencies other than the dollar and the cost of goods, services, and manpower we purchase in currencies other than the dollar. Because we sell more in local currencies than we purchase, we have a net exposure to changes in the dollar’s value. Foreign exchange rates also affect the carrying value of our foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities. To buffer these exchange rate fluctuations, we regularly hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure. But over the long term, our reported financial results will generally be negatively affected by a stronger dollar and positively affected by a weaker dollar.
We estimate that our foreign currency revenue will exceed our foreign currency expenses by $807 million in fiscal 2019. We hedge those currencies considered to be significant exposures based on value at risk; the estimated transactional exposure for the hedged currencies is $734 million.
We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our transactional foreign exchange risk and, in some circumstances, our net asset exposure. If these contracts remain effective, we will not recognize any unrealized gains or losses until we either recognize the underlying hedged transactions in earnings or convert the underlying hedged net asset exposures. At April 30, 2018, our total foreign currency hedges had a notional value of $1,098 million, with a maximum term outstanding of 36 months, and were recorded as a net liability at their fair value of $38 million.
As of April 30, 2018, we hedged 64% of the estimated fiscal 2019 transactional exposure for hedged currencies by entering into foreign currency forward contracts. Considering these hedges and spot rates as of April 30, 2018 compared to fiscal 2018’s effective exchange rates, we expect a modest negative effect to our fiscal 2019 operating income. We estimate that a 10% increase/decrease in the average value of the dollar in fiscal 2019 relative to spot rates as of April 30, 2018 would decrease/increase our fiscal 2019 operating income by approximately $35 million.
Commodity Prices. Commodity prices are affected by weather, supply and demand, as well as geopolitical and economic variables. To reduce price volatility, we use deliverable contracts for corn (in which we take physical delivery of the corn underlying each contract) rather than futures contracts or options.
Interest Rates. As of April 30, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents ($239 million) and variable-rate debt ($215 million) are exposed to the risk of interest rate changes. Based on the net balance of these items, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in a negligible decrease in net interest expense.
