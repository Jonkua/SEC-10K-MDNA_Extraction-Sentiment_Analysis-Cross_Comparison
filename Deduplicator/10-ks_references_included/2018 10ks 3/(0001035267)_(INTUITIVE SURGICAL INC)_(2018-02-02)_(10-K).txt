ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview
Open surgery remains the predominant form of surgery and is used in almost every area of the body. However, the large incisions required for open surgery create trauma to patients, typically resulting in longer hospitalization and recovery times, increased hospitalization costs, and additional pain and suffering relative to MIS, where MIS is available. For over three decades, MIS has reduced trauma to patients by allowing selected surgeries to be performed through small ports rather than large incisions. MIS has been widely adopted for certain surgical procedures.
da Vinci Surgical Systems enable surgeons to extend the benefits of MIS to many patients who would otherwise undergo a more invasive surgery by using computational, robotic and imaging technologies to overcome many of the limitations of conventional MIS. Surgeons using a da Vinci Surgical System operate while seated comfortably at a console viewing a 3-D representation of an HD image of the surgical field. This immersive visualization connects surgeons to the surgical field and their instruments. While seated at the console, the surgeon manipulates instrument controls in a natural manner, similar to the open surgery technique. Our technology is designed to provide surgeons with a range of motion of MIS instruments in the surgical field analogous to the motions of a human wrist, while filtering out the tremor inherent in a surgeon’s hand. In designing our products, we focus on making our technology easy and safe to use.
Our products fall into four broad categories - the da Vinci Surgical Systems, InSite and Firefly Fluorescence imaging systems (“Firefly”), instruments and accessories (e.g., EndoWrist, EndoWrist Vessel Sealer, da Vinci Single-Site and EndoWrist Stapler), and training technologies. We have commercialized the following da Vinci Surgical Systems: the da Vinci standard Surgical System, commercialized in 1999, the da Vinci S Surgical System, commercialized in 2006, the da Vinci Si Surgical System, commercialized in 2009, the da Vinci Xi Surgical System, commercialized in 2014, and the da Vinci X Surgical System, commercialized in the second quarter of 2017. These systems include a surgeon’s console (or consoles), imaging electronics, a patient-side cart, and computational hardware and software.
We offer over 80 different multi-port da Vinci instruments enabling surgeons’ flexibility in choosing the types of tools needed in a particular surgery. These multi-port instruments are generally robotically controlled versions of surgical tools that surgeons would use in either open or laparoscopic surgery. We offer advanced instrumentation for the da Vinci Si, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci X platforms, including the EndoWrist Vessel Sealer and EndoWrist Stapler products, to provide surgeons with sophisticated, computer-aided tools to precisely and efficiently interact with tissue. da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi Surgical Systems share the same instruments whereas da Vinci Si Surgical System uses different instruments.
We offer Single-Site instruments for use with the da Vinci Si, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci X Surgical Systems. Single-Site instruments are most commonly used in cholecystectomy and hysterectomy procedures. Single-Site instruments enable surgeons to also perform surgery through a single port via the patient’s belly button, resulting in the potential for virtually scarless results.
Training technologies include our da Vinci Skills Simulator, da Vinci Connect remote case observation and mentoring tool, and our dual console for use in surgeon proctoring and collaborative surgery.

Business Model
Overview
We generate revenue from the initial capital sales of da Vinci Surgical Systems, including systems under sales-type lease arrangements, and revenue from operating lease arrangements and from the subsequent sales of instruments, accessories, and service. The da Vinci Surgical System generally sells for approximately between $0.5 million and $2.5 million, depending upon the model, configuration and geography, and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers. Our instruments and accessories have limited lives and will either expire or wear out as they are used in surgery, at which point they need to be replaced. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold at an annual rate of approximately $80,000 to $170,000, depending upon the configuration of the underlying system and composition of the services offered under the contract. These service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods.
Recurring Revenue
Recurring revenue consists of instrument and accessory revenue, service revenue, and operating lease revenue. Recurring revenue increased to $2.2 billion, or 72% of total revenue in 2017, compared with $1.9 billion, or 71% of total revenue in 2016, and $1.7 billion, or 70% of total revenue in 2015.
Instrument and accessory revenue has generally grown at a faster rate than system revenue in the last few fiscal years. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $1.6 billion in 2017, compared with $1.4 billion in 2016 and $1.2 billion in 2015. The growth of instrument and accessory revenue largely reflect continued procedure adoption.

Service revenue growth has been driven by the growth of the base of installed da Vinci Surgical Systems. The installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems grew 13% to approximately 4,409 at December 31, 2017; 9% to approximately 3,919 at December 31, 2016; and 10% to approximately 3,597 at December 31, 2015. Service revenue grew 13% to $581.8 million in 2017; 11% to $517.0 million in 2016; and 8% to $464.8 million in 2015.
 Operating lease revenue has grown as a larger proportion of systems shipped are under operating lease arrangements. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, a total of 108, 62, and 43 of system placements were classified as operating leases, respectively. Revenue from operating lease arrangements is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, was $25.9 million, $16.6 million and $7.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, a total of 164 da Vinci Surgical Systems were installed at customers under operating lease arrangements.
Intuitive Surgical da Vinci System Leasing
Since 2013, we have entered into sales-type and operating lease arrangements directly with certain qualified customers as a way to offer customers flexibility in how they acquire da Vinci Surgical Systems and expand da Vinci Surgery availability while leveraging our balance sheet. The leases generally have commercially competitive terms as compared with other third party entities that offer equipment leasing. We include both operating and sales-type leases in our system shipment and installed base disclosures. We exclude operating leases from our system average selling prices computations.
In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we shipped 139, 95, and 63 systems under lease arrangements, respectively, of which 108, 62, and 43 were classified as operating leases, respectively. Generally, the operating lease arrangements provide our customers with the right to purchase the leased system at some point during and/or at the end of the lease term. Revenue generated from customer purchases of systems under operating lease arrangements (“Lease Buyouts”) was $39.5 million, $38.2 million, and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We expect that revenue recognized from customer exercises of the buyout options will fluctuate based on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise their buyout options. We believe our leasing program has been effective and well-received, and we are willing to expand it based on customer demand, including offering more flexible options such as variable lease payments.
Systems Revenue
System placements are driven by procedure growth in most markets. In geographies where da Vinci procedure adoption is in an early stage, system sales will precede procedure growth. System placements also vary due to seasonality. System revenue grew 15% to $910.2 million in 2017; 10% to $791.6 million in 2016; and 14% to $721.9 million in 2015. System revenue is also affected by the proportion of systems placed that are under operating lease arrangements, recurring operating lease revenue, operating lease buyouts, product mix, ASPs, and trade-in activities.
Procedure Mix / Products
Our procedure business is primarily comprised of: (1) cancer and other highly complex procedures and (2) less complex procedures for benign conditions. Cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions. Thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex benign conditions. Our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economic solutions in each of these procedure categories. Our fully featured da Vinci Xi Surgical System with advanced instruments including the EndoWrist Vessel Sealer, EndoWrist Stapler products, and our Table Motion product target the more complex procedure segment. Lower priced products, including the three-arm da Vinci Si-e Surgical System, refurbished da Vinci Si Surgical System, and Single-Site instruments, are targeted towards less complex procedures. Our da Vinci X Surgical System is priced between the da Vinci Si and Xi Surgical Systems and offers customers access to many of the da Vinci Xi features, including da Vinci Xi advanced instrumentation and imaging systems, at a lower price point.
Procedure Seasonality
More than half of da Vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions, most notably benign hysterectomies, hernia repairs, and cholecystectomies. Hysterectomies for benign conditions, hernia repairs, cholecystectomies, and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer operations and surgeries for other life threatening conditions. Seasonality in the U.S. for these procedures for benign conditions typically results in higher fourth quarter procedure volume when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower first quarter procedure volume when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside the U.S. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods.
Distribution Channels
We provide our products through direct sales organizations in the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Europe, excluding Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Eastern European countries. In the remainder of our OUS markets, we provide our products through distributors.

Regulatory Activities
Clearances and Approvals
We have obtained the clearances required to market our multi-port products associated with all of our da Vinci Surgical Systems (Standard, S, Si, Xi, and X systems) for our targeted surgical specialties within the U.S., South Korea, and the European markets in which we operate.
In April 2017, we received CE mark clearance for our da Vinci X Surgical System in Europe. Following the CE mark, in May 2017, we received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) clearance to market our da Vinci X Surgical System in the U.S. We received regulatory clearance for the da Vinci X Surgical System in South Korea in September 2017 (see the description of the da Vinci X Surgical System in the New Product Introductions section below). Regulatory clearances for da Vinci X Surgical System may be received in other markets over time.
In January 2016, we received FDA clearance for our Integrated Table Motion product. In March 2016, we received FDA 510(k) clearances in the U.S. and CE mark clearances in Europe for Single-Site instruments and the 30mm EndoWrist stapler products for the da Vinci Xi Surgical System (see the description of the EndoWrist Stapler 30 in the New Product Introductions section below).
In April 2014, we received FDA clearance to market our da Vinci Single Port Surgical System in the U.S. for single-port urologic surgeries. At the time, we decided not to market that version of the da Vinci Single Port Surgical System. We instead elected to pursue the necessary modifications to integrate it into our fourth generation da Vinci Xi/X product family as a dedicated single port patient console compatible with the existing da Vinci Xi/X surgeon console, vision cart, and other equipment. We have since completed these modifications and executed clinical evaluations of the product. In December 2017, we submitted our form 510(k) for this da Vinci Single Port Surgical System for certain urology procedures. In the future, we intend to file additional form 510(k)s for procedures in which a single small entry point to the body and parallel delivery of instruments is important. Such surgeries could include those performed through a natural orifice like the mouth for head and neck procedures or those performed through a single skin incision.
We obtained approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) for our da Vinci Xi Surgical System in March 2015. National reimbursement status was received for dVP procedures in Japan effective April 2012 and for da Vinci partial nephrectomy procedures in April 2016. With our support, Japanese university hospitals and surgical societies are seeking reimbursement for additional procedures through the MHLW’s Senshin Iryo (Advanced Medical Care) processes as well as alternative reimbursement processes. There are multiple pathways to obtain reimbursement for procedures including those that require in-country clinical data/economic data. Reimbursements are considered in April of even numbered years. In January 2018, a committee of the MHLW recommended 12 additional procedures for reimbursement. The reimbursement levels for each procedure is uncertain and may be inadequate for broad adoption. There can be no assurance that we will gain additional reimbursements for the procedures or at the times we have targeted. If we are not successful in obtaining additional regulatory clearances, and adequate procedure reimbursements for future products and procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited.
Recalls and Corrections
Medical device companies have regulatory obligations to correct or remove medical devices in the field that could pose a risk to health. The definition of “recalls and corrections” is expansive and includes repair, replacement, inspections, relabeling, and issuance of new or additional instructions for use or reinforcement of existing instructions for use and training when such actions are taken for specific reasons of safety or compliance. These field actions require stringent documentation, reporting, and monitoring worldwide. There are other actions a medical device manufacturer may take in the field without reporting, including, but not limited to, routine servicing and stock rotations.
As we determine whether a field action is reportable in any regulatory jurisdiction, we prepare and submit notifications to the appropriate regulatory agency for the particular jurisdiction. Regulators can require the expansion, reclassification, or change in scope and language of the field action. In general, upon submitting required notifications to regulators regarding a field action which is a recall or correction, we will notify customers regarding the field action, provide any additional documentation required in their national language, and arrange, as required, return or replacement of the affected product or a field service visit to perform the correction.
Field actions as well as certain outcomes from regulatory activities can result in adverse effects on our business, including damage to our reputation, delays by customers of purchase decisions, reduction or stoppage of the use of installed systems, and reduced revenue as well as increased expenses.

Procedures
We model patient value as equal to procedure efficacy / invasiveness. In this equation procedure efficacy is defined as a measure of the success of the surgery in resolving the underlying disease and invasiveness is defined as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. When the patient value of a da Vinci procedure is greater than that of alternative treatment options, patients may benefit from seeking out surgeons and hospitals that offer da Vinci Surgery, which could potentially result in a local market share shift. da Vinci procedure adoption occurs procedure by procedure, market by market, and is driven by the relative patient value and total treatment costs of da Vinci procedures as compared to alternative treatment options for the same disease state or condition.
Worldwide Procedures
da Vinci systems and instruments are regulated independently in various countries and regions of the world. The discussion of indications for use and representative or target procedures is intended solely to provide an understanding of the market for da Vinci products and is not intended to promote for sale or use any Intuitive Surgical product outside of its licensed or cleared labeling and indications for use.
The adoption of da Vinci Surgery has the potential to grow for those procedures that offer greater patient value than non-da Vinci alternatives, within the prevailing economics of healthcare providers. da Vinci Surgical Systems are used primarily in gynecologic surgery, general surgery, urologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. We focus our organization and investments on developing, marketing, and training for those products and targeted procedures where da Vinci can bring patient value relative to alternative treatment options and/or economic benefit to healthcare providers. Target procedures in gynecology include da Vinci Hysterectomy (“dVH”), for both cancer and benign conditions, and sacrocolpopexy. Target procedures in general surgery include hernia repair (both ventral and inguinal) and colorectal procedures. Target procedures in urology include dVP and partial nephrectomy. In cardiothoracic surgery, target procedures include da Vinci Lobectomy and da Vinci Mitral Valve Repair. In head and neck surgery, target procedures include certain procedures resecting benign and malignant tumors classified as T1 and T2. Not all the indications, procedures, or products described may be available in a given country or region or on all generations of da Vinci Surgical Systems. Patients need to consult the product labeling in their specific country and for each product in order to determine the actual authorized uses, as well as important limitations, restrictions, or contraindications.
In 2017, approximately 877,000 surgical procedures were performed with the da Vinci Surgical Systems, compared with approximately 753,000 and 652,000 procedures performed in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The growth in our overall procedure volume in 2017 was driven by growth in U.S. general surgery procedures and worldwide urologic procedures.
U.S. Procedures
Overall U.S. procedure volume grew to approximately 644,000 in 2017, compared with approximately 563,000 in 2016, and approximately 499,000 in 2015. For 2017, general surgery was our fastest growing specialty in the U.S. with procedure volume that grew to approximately 246,000 in 2017, compared with approximately 186,000 in 2016 and 140,000 in 2015, and the second largest in procedure volume. For 2017, gynecology was our largest U.S. surgical specialty and the procedure volume was approximately 252,000 in 2017, compared with 246,000 in 2016 and 238,000 in 2015. U.S. urology procedure volume was approximately 118,000 in 2017, compared with approximately 109,000 in 2016, and 102,000 in 2015.
Procedures Outside of the U.S.
Overall OUS procedures grew to approximately 233,000 in 2017, compared with approximately 190,000 in 2016 and approximately 153,000 in 2015. Procedure growth in most OUS markets was driven largely by urology procedure volume, which grew to approximately 149,000 in 2017, compared with approximately 124,000 in 2016, and approximately 102,000 in 2015. General surgery, and gynecologic oncology procedures also contributed to OUS procedure growth.

Recent Business Events and Trends

Procedures
Overall. During the year ended December 31, 2017, total da Vinci procedures grew approximately 16% compared with 15% for the year ended December 31, 2016. U.S. procedure growth during the year ended December 31, 2017, was approximately 14% compared with approximately 13% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher 2017 U.S. procedure growth was largely attributable to growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair and colorectal procedures, and thoracic procedures, as well as continued moderate growth in more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories.
Procedure volume OUS for the year ended December 31, 2017, grew approximately 23% compared with approximately 24% growth for the year ended December 31, 2016, driven by continued growth in dVP procedures and earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery, and gynecology. We believe growth in these global markets is being driven by increased acceptance among surgeons and health systems, supported by expanded global evidence validating the clinical and economic value of da Vinci procedures.

U.S. Gynecology. In 2017, gynecology was our largest U.S. surgical specialty and the procedure volume was approximately 252,000 in 2017, compared with 246,000 in 2016 and 238,000 in 2015. We believe that overall U.S. gynecologic surgery volume for benign conditions (robotic and other modalities) has been pressured in recent years by factors including, but not limited to, a trend by payers toward encouraging conservative disease management, trends towards higher patient deductibles and co-pays, and FDA actions regarding the use of power morcellation in uterine surgeries. Combining robotic, laparoscopic, and vaginal approaches, MIS represents about 80% of the U.S. hysterectomy market for benign conditions, and thus the rate of migration from open surgeries to MIS has slowed. We believe that our modest growth in gynecologic procedures over the past several years was primarily driven by consolidation of surgical volumes into surgeons that focus on cancer and complex surgeries, as well as higher sacrocolpopexy procedure volume.
U.S. General Surgery. In 2017, general surgery was our second largest and fastest growing specialty in the U.S. with procedure volume that grew to approximately 246,000 in 2017, compared with approximately 186,000 in 2016, and 140,000 in 2015. Ventral and inguinal hernia, combined, contributed to the most incremental growth in U.S. general surgery procedures in 2016 and 2017. We believe that growth in da Vinci hernia repair reflects improved clinical outcomes within certain patient populations, as well as potential cost benefits relative to certain alternative treatments. We believe hernia repair procedures represent a significant opportunity with the potential to drive growth in future periods. However, given the differences in complexity among hernia patient populations and varying surgeon opinion regarding optimal surgical technique, it is difficult to estimate the timing of and to what extent da Vinci hernia repair procedure volume will grow in the future. We expect a large portion of hernia repairs will continue to be performed via different modalities of surgery.
Adoption of da Vinci for colorectal procedures, which includes several underlying procedures including low anterior resections for rectal cancers and certain colon procedures for benign and cancerous conditions, has been ongoing for several years, and is supported by our recently launched technologies such as the da Vinci Xi Surgical System, EndoWrist Stapler, EndoWrist Vessel Sealer, and Integrated Table Motion. da Vinci use in cholecystectomy grew modestly in 2017 compared to a modest decline in 2016. 2017 cholecystectomy growth was driven by higher multi-port cholecystectomies, more than offsetting lower Single-Site cholecystectomy volume.
Global Urology. Along with U.S. general surgery, global urology procedures drove our recent procedure growth. dVP is the largest urology procedure in the U.S. and is at various stages of adoption in different areas of the world. We believe our growth in U.S. prostatectomy is largely aligned with new diagnoses of prostate cancer. As the U.S. standard of care for the surgical treatment of prostate cancer, we expect that the number of dVP procedures performed in the U.S. will largely fluctuate with the overall prostatectomy market. dVP is the largest overall OUS procedure.
Kidney cancer procedures have also been a strong contributor to our recent global urology procedure growth. Clinical publications have demonstrated that the presence of a da Vinci system in a hospital or market increases the likelihood that a patient will receive nephron sparing surgery through a partial nephrectomy, which is typically surgical society guideline-recommended therapy.
OUS Procedures. The 2017 OUS procedure growth rate reflects continued da Vinci adoption in European and Asian markets. Growth was strong in Asia and varied by country in Europe. We experienced strong procedure growth in China as systems sold under a previous public hospital quota system have been installed and as utilization of those systems have increased. However, procedure growth is moderating in China. Future system placements and our ability to sustain procedure growth in China are dependent on obtaining additional importation authorizations or public hospital quotas, as well as on hospitals completing a central purchasing tender process under such authorizations. The most recent authorization expired at the end of 2015. The timing and magnitude of future authorizations that may enable future system placements is not certain. We have experienced strong procedure growth in Japan since receiving the national reimbursements, outlined above, for dVP and partial nephrectomy. However, as adoption for these procedures has progressed, procedure growth in Japan is slowing. Future procedure growth in Japan will likely be paced by the timing of procedure reimbursement approvals for procedures as well as the reimbursement levels for any of these procedures in addition to dVP and partial nephrectomy. In January 2018, a committee of the MHLW recommended 12 additional procedures for reimbursement. The reimbursement level for each procedure is uncertain at this time and may be insufficient for broad adoption. In addition, it is possible that procedures will be adopted slowly or not at all, as there can be no assurance that the perceived value of da Vinci procedures is greater than alternative therapies.

System Demand
Future demand for da Vinci Surgical Systems will be impacted by factors including hospital response to the evolving health care environment under the current U.S. administration, procedure growth rates, hospital consolidation trends, evolving system utilization and point of care dynamics, capital replacement trends, additional reimbursements in various global markets, including Japan, the timing around governmental tenders and authorizations, including China, the timing of when we receive regulatory clearance in our other OUS markets for our Xi Surgical System, X Surgical System, and related instruments as well as other economic and geopolitical factors. Market acceptance of our recently launched X Surgical System may also impact future systems placement. Demand may also be impacted by robotic surgery competition, including from companies that have introduced products

New Product Introductions
da Vinci X Surgical System. In May 2017, we launched a new da Vinci model, the da Vinci X, in the U.S. The da Vinci X system provides surgeons and hospitals with access to some of the most advanced robotic-assisted surgery technology at a lower cost. The da Vinci X uses the same vision cart and surgeon console that are found on our flagship product, the da Vinci Xi system, giving our customers the option of adding advanced capabilities, and providing a pathway for upgrading should they choose to do so as their practices and needs grow.
The da Vinci X enables optimized, focused-quadrant surgery including procedures like prostatectomy, hernia repair, and benign hysterectomy, among others. The system features flexible port placement and 3-D digital optics, while incorporating the same advanced instruments and accessories as the da Vinci Xi. The new system drives operational efficiencies through set-up technology that uses voice and laser guidance, drape design that simplifies surgery preparations, and a lightweight, fully integrated endoscope.
da Vinci Xi Integrated Table Motion. In January 2016, we launched Integrated Table Motion in the U.S. Integrated Table Motion coordinates the movements of the da Vinci robot arms with an advanced operating room table, the TruSystem® 7000dV sold by Trumpf MedicalTM, to enable shifting a patient's position in real-time while the da Vinci surgical robotic arms remain docked. This gives operating room teams the capabilities to optimally position the operating table so that gravity exposes anatomy during multi-quadrant da Vinci System procedures, maximize reach and access to target anatomy enabling surgeons to interact with tissue at an ideal working angle, and reposition the table during the procedure to enhance anesthesiologists’ care of the patient.
EndoWrist Stapler 30. In March 2016, we received  FDA clearance in the U.S. for the EndoWrist Stapler 30 instrument with Blue, Green, White, and Gray 30mm reloads for use with the da Vinci Xi Surgical System. It is intended to deliver particular utility with fine tissue interaction in lobectomy and other thoracic procedures. The EndoWrist Stapler 30 is a wristed, stapling instrument intended for resection, transection, and/or creation of anastomoses. EndoWrist Stapler 30 broadens our existing stapler product line which includes EndoWrist Stapler 45 Blue, Green, and White reloads. Not all reloads or staplers are available for use on all systems or in all countries.

Intuitive Surgical-Fosun Medical Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
In September 2016, we agreed to establish a joint venture with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (“Fosun Pharma”), a subsidiary of Fosun International Limited, to research, develop, manufacture, and sell robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices. The joint venture will initially produce products targeting early diagnosis and cost-effective treatment of lung cancer, one of the most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer in the world. The technology will be used in robotic-assisted medical devices based on catheters and incorporates proprietary intellectual property developed or owned by us. The joint venture is located in Shanghai, China, where it will perform research and development activities and manufacture catheter-based products for global distribution. Distribution in China will be conducted by the joint venture, while distribution outside of China will be conducted by us. The joint venture is owned 60% by us and 40% by Fosun Pharma. The companies will contribute up to $100 million as required by the joint venture, an arrangement representing a significant expansion of our relationship with Fosun Pharma. Since 2011, Chindex Medical Limited, a subsidiary of Fosun Pharma, has been our distribution partner for da Vinci Surgical Systems in China.
In the second quarter of 2017, the joint venture company was legally formed after receiving required approvals from the relevant PRC government authorities and administrative agencies. During the third quarter of 2017, the joint venture received contributions from us and Fosun Pharma. The joint venture also commenced hiring employees and began planning for the establishment of manufacturing infrastructure. For 2017, the joint venture did not have a material impact on our consolidated results. We expect that the joint venture will incur net losses before product commercialization and ramp up periods after commercialization, and that it will not generate revenue in 2018. Further, there can be no assurance that we and the joint venture can successfully complete the development of the robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices; that we and the joint venture will successfully commercialize such products; that the joint venture will not require additional contributions to fund its business; or that the joint venture will become profitable.

• As of December 31, 2017, we had $3.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments decreased by $1.0 billion compared with December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the $2.3 billion accelerated share buyback executed and settled during 2017, partially offset by cash generated from operating activities and employee stock option exercises.

Total Revenue
Total revenue increased by 16% to $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by 13% compared with $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflects 17% higher instrument and accessory revenue driven by approximately 16% higher procedure volume, 15% higher systems revenue, and 13% higher service revenue. The increase in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflects 17% higher instrument and accessory revenue driven by approximately 15% higher procedure volume, 10% higher systems revenue, and 11% higher service revenue.
Revenue denominated in foreign currencies was approximately 17%, 19%, and 19% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We sell our products and services in Euros and British Pounds in those European markets where we have direct distribution channels, and in Japanese Yen and Korean Won in Japan and South Korea, respectively. Foreign currency did not have a material impact on total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared with 2016, or for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with 2015.
 Revenue generated in the U.S. accounted for 73%, 72%, and 71% of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We believe that U.S. revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue due to patients’ ability to choose their provider and method of treatment in the U.S., reimbursement structures supportive of innovation and minimally invasive surgery, and initial investments focused on U.S. infrastructure. We have been investing in our business in the OUS market and our OUS procedures have grown faster in proportion to U.S. procedures. We expect that our OUS procedures and revenue will make up a greater portion of our business in the long term.

Product Revenue
2016-2017
Product revenue increased by 16% to $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Instrument and accessory revenue increased by 17% to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by procedure growth of approximately 16% and higher sales of our advanced instruments, partially offset by customer efficiency gains and timing of orders. U.S. procedure growth in 2017 was approximately 14% compared with 13% in 2016 and was driven by growth in general surgery procedures, most notably hernia repair and colorectal procedures; thoracic procedures; and a moderate growth in the more mature gynecologic and urologic procedure categories. OUS procedure growth was approximately 23% for 2017, compared with 24% for 2016, driven by continued growth in dVP procedures, earlier stage growth in kidney cancer procedures, general surgery, and gynecology. Geographically, OUS procedure growth for the year ended December 31, 2017, was driven by strong procedure expansion in Japan, China, and South Korea. Procedure growth varied by country in our European market.
Systems revenue increased by 15% to $910.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $791.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Higher systems revenue was primarily driven by higher system shipments and partly offset

Table of Contents

by a higher number of system placements under operating lease arrangements and lower da Vinci Surgical System average selling price ("ASP").
During 2017, a total of 684 systems were shipped compared with 537 systems in 2016. By geography, 417 systems were shipped into the U.S., 108 into Asia, 122 into Europe, and 37 into other markets, compared with 338 systems shipped into the U.S., 96 into Asia, 79 into Europe, and 24 into other markets in 2016. During 2017, 108 of the 684 systems were shipped under operating lease arrangements compared with 62 of 537 systems shipped during 2016. The increase in systems shipments was primarily driven by procedure growth and the need for hospitals to expand or establish capacity.
Operating lease revenue was $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue from Lease Buyouts was $39.5 million for year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $38.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The da Vinci Surgical System ASP, excluding the impact of systems shipped under operating leases, was approximately $1.47 million and $1.52 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The lower 2017 ASP was driven by a higher proportion of systems sales into price sensitive market segments. ASPs fluctuate period to period based on geographic and product mix, product pricing, systems shipped involving trade-ins, and changes in foreign exchange rates.
2015-2016
Product revenue increased by 14% to $2.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016, from $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015.
Instrument and accessory revenue increased by 17% to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in instrument and accessory revenue was driven by an approximate 15% increase in procedure volume, reflecting approximately 13% U.S. procedure growth and 24% OUS procedure growth, and higher sales of our advanced instruments, partially offset by customer buying patterns.
Systems revenue increased by 10% to $791.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $721.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Higher systems revenue was driven by higher system shipments, higher number of Lease Buyouts, and higher revenue from our Integrated Table Motion product. Revenue from Lease Buyouts was $38.2 million for year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The da Vinci Surgical System ASP, excluding the impact of systems shipped under operating leases, was approximately $1.52 million and $1.54 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Service Revenue
Service revenue increased by 13% to $581.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $517.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Service revenue increased by 11% to $517.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $464.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Higher service revenue in 2017 and 2016 was primarily driven by a larger installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems producing service revenue.

Gross Profit
Product gross profit increased by 18% for the year ended December 31, 2017, to $1.8 billion, representing 70.4% of product revenue, compared with $1.5 billion, representing 69.7% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher 2017 product gross profit was primarily driven by higher product revenue.
The slightly higher product gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, was due to manufacturing efficiencies and product cost reductions on some of our newer products, partially offset by a $7.8 million litigation settlement charge related to a license and supply agreement recognized in cost of revenue during the first quarter of 2017, and a $7.1 million MDET refund in 2016. In December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (the “Appropriations Act”) was signed into law. The Appropriations Act included a two-year moratorium on MDET such that medical device sales in 2016 and 2017 were exempt from the excise tax. New legislation was passed in January 2018 such that MDET will be delayed until January 1, 2020.
Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by 20% to $1.5 billion, or 69.7% of product revenue, compared with $1.3 billion, or 66.3% of product revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher 2016 product gross profit was primarily driven by higher product revenue and higher gross profit margin. The higher product gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared with the year ended December 31, 2015, was driven by product cost reductions and manufacturing efficiencies on our da Vinci Xi System and other newer products, and favorable product mix, including higher sales of our da Vinci Xi Integrated Table Motion product. Product gross profit also included a $7.1 million MDET refund for the year ended December 31, 2016, while product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015, included $17.0 million of MDET expense, representing approximately 0.9% of total product revenue.

Product gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, included share-based compensation expense of $28.1 million, $25.2 million, and $22.8 million, respectively, and amortization expense of intangible assets of $5.4 million, $7.8 million, and $12.7 million, respectively.
Service gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased to $401.9 million, or 69.1% of service revenue, compared with $366.0 million, or 70.8% of service revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher 2017 service gross profit was driven by higher service revenue, reflecting a larger installed base of da Vinci Surgical Systems, partially offset by lower service gross profit margin. The lower service gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily driven by higher costs associated with the repair of da Vinci Xi endoscope products.
Service gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased to $366.0 million, or 70.8% of service revenue, compared with $305.5 million, or 65.7% of service revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher service gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily driven by improved efficiency and gains made in servicing the da Vinci Xi Surgical System.
 Service gross profit for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, included share-based compensation expense of $14.0 million, $12.4 million, and $12.9 million, respectively.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs for sales, marketing and administrative personnel, sales and marketing activities, tradeshow expenses, legal expenses, regulatory fees, and general corporate expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by 15% to $810.9 million, compared with $705.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher variable compensation costs, higher OUS expenses associated with our expanded Asian and European teams, infrastructure to support our growth, higher headcount, and higher litigation charges. Selling, general and administrative expenses also included pre-tax litigation charges of $17.5 million and $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by 10% to $705.3 million compared with $640.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher OUS expenses associated with our expanded Asian and European teams, infrastructure, higher headcount, and higher legal fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses also included pre-tax litigation charges of $12.1 million and $13.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015 respectively.
Share-based compensation expense charged to selling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, was $111.8 million, $97.4 million, and $94.7 million, respectively.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with the design, development, testing, and significant enhancement of our products.
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by 37% to $328.6 million, compared with $239.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other project costs to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including our da Vinci Single Port Surgical System; robotic-assisted catheter-based medical devices; advanced imaging and analytics; advanced instrumentation; future generations of robotics; and expense related to licensed intellectual property.
Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by 21% to $239.6 million compared with $197.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other project costs to support a broader set of product development initiatives, including additional da Vinci Xi platform products; da Vinci Single Port Surgical System; our robotic-assisted catheter-based system; advanced imaging and analytics; advanced instrumentation; and next generation robotics.
Share-based compensation expense charged to research and development expense during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, was $56.0 million, $43.0 million, and $37.7 million, respectively. Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, was $7.5 million, $10.4 million, and $11.7 million, respectively.
Research and development expenses fluctuate with project timing. Based upon our broader set of product development initiatives and the stage of the underlying projects, we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future.

Interest and Other Income, Net
Interest and other income, net, was $41.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $35.6 million for 2016 and $18.5 million for 2015. The increase in interest and other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2017, was primarily driven by higher interest earned due to higher interest rates. The increase in interest and other income, net, for the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily driven by higher interest earned on higher cash and investment balances.

Income Tax Expense
Our income tax expense was $436.5 million, $244.9 million, and $169.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2017 was approximately 39.8% compared with 25.0% for 2016, and 22.4% for 2015. Our effective tax rate for 2017 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the effect of the below mentioned one-time discrete items and state income taxes net of federal benefit, partially offset by income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate and reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits. Our tax rates for 2016 and 2015 differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the effect of income earned by certain of our overseas entities being taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate and reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by state income taxes net of federal benefit.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes in existing tax law impacting businesses, including a one-time deemed repatriation of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. Under U.S. GAAP, changes in tax rates and tax law are accounted for in the period of enactment and deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the enacted tax rate. Consistent with guidance issued by the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which provides for a measurement period of one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting for effects of the 2017 Tax Act, we provisionally recorded an income tax expense of $317.8 million related to the 2017 Tax Act. Based on information available, we reflected a provisional estimate of $270.2 million of income tax expense related to the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we can repatriate our cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed with minimal U.S. income tax consequences other than the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. In addition, we recorded a provisional estimate of $47.6 million income tax expense due to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets at a U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. For the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act, a provisional estimate could not be made as we have not yet completed our assessment or elected an accounting policy to either recognize deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI or to record GILTI as period costs if and when incurred.
In accordance with SEC guidance, provisional amounts may be refined as a result of additional guidance from, and interpretations by, U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies, and changes in assumptions. In the subsequent period, provisional amounts will be adjusted for the effects, if any, of interpretative guidance issued after December 31, 2017, by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The effects of the 2017 Tax Act may be subject to changes for items that were previously reported as provisional amounts, as well as any element of the 2017 Tax Act that a provisional estimate could not be made, and such changes could result in a material effect on our future effective tax rate.
Our 2017, 2016, and 2015 tax provision reflected tax benefits of $62.4 million, $15.8 million, and $6.4 million, respectively, associated with the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits and interests resulting from expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions and certain audit settlements. Our 2017 tax provision also reflected excess tax benefits recognized in income tax expense under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting. Our 2015 tax provision also reflected a $29.3 million tax benefit resulting from a U.S. Tax Court opinion involving an independent third party, issued in the third quarter of 2015. Based on the findings of the U.S. Tax Court, we were required to, and did, refund to our foreign subsidiaries the share-based compensation element of certain intercompany charges made in prior periods. Starting from 2015, share-based compensation has been excluded from intercompany charges.
In the first quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU No. 2016-09, which changes how the tax effects of share-based awards are recognized. ASU No. 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with employee equity to be recognized in the provision for income taxes as discrete items in the period when the awards vest or are settled, whereas previously such income tax effects were recorded as part of additional paid-in capital. Our provision for income taxes included excess tax benefits associated with employee equity plans of $102.8 million, which reduced our effective tax rate by 9.4 percentage points for the year ended December 31, 2017. The amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies will fluctuate from period to period based on the price of our stock, the volume of share-based instruments settled or vested, and the value assigned to employee equity awards under U.S. GAAP. We expect that the adoption of this ASU will result in increased income tax expense volatility.
The tax holiday obtained in 2007 for our business operations in Switzerland ended on December 31, 2017. We received a new tax ruling in Switzerland for new business operations. The new tax ruling is effective for years 2018 through 2022, which will be extended for the next five years thereafter, to the extent certain terms and conditions continue to be met. The new ruling would allow for a reduced cantonal tax rate based on various thresholds of investment, including the ownership, development, and use of non-U.S. intellectual property rights and employment in such jurisdiction. The transfer of ownership of such intellectual

property rights to our Swiss entity did not impact the Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods presented. We currently do not expect that the change will materially impact our future annual Swiss tax obligation.
We file federal, state, and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the U.S. and abroad. Years prior to 2014 are considered closed for most significant jurisdictions. Certain of our unrecognized tax benefits could reverse based on the normal expiration of various statutes of limitations, which could affect our effective tax rate in the period in which they reverse.
We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The outcome of these audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Management regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash
Our principal source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and issuance of common stock through exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program. Cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments decreased by $1.0 billion to $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2017, from $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the $2.3 billion accelerated share buyback program executed and settled during 2017, partly offset by cash provided by our operations and employee stock option exercises. Cash and cash equivalents plus short- and long-term investments increased from $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015, to $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of cash provided by our operations and employee stock option exercises. Cash generation is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting our operating, investing, and financing needs.
As of December 31, 2017, $1,543.4 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were held by foreign subsidiaries. Previously, amounts held by foreign subsidiaries were generally subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. However, the 2017 Tax Act enacted in December 2017, requires us to pay a one-time deemed repatriation toll charge on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not previously provided U.S. taxes. We estimated that our obligation associated with this one-time deemed repatriation toll charge to be $270.2 million, which will be paid in installments over eight years. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we can repatriate our cumulative undistributed foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed with minimal U.S. income tax consequences other than the one-time deemed repatriation toll charge and do not expect other material non-U.S. tax consequences. We will continue to evaluate whether to repatriate all or a portion of the cumulative undistributed foreign earnings based on expansion needs and as circumstances change. We are still evaluating whether to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the 2017 Tax Act and consider that conclusion to be incomplete under guidance issued by the SEC. If we subsequently change our assertion during the measurement period, we will account for the change in assertion as part of the 2017 Tax Act enactment. We believe the cash flows provided by our operations will meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.
See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for discussion on the impact of interest rate risk and market risk on our investment portfolio.

Operating Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by our operating activities of $1,143.9 million exceeded our net income of $660.0 million due to non-cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities as outlined below:

-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Our net income included non-cash charges, including share-based compensation of $209.1 million, depreciation and loss of disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $86.2 million, deferred income taxes of $62.9 million, investment related non-cash charges of $21.2 million, and amortization of intangible assets of $12.9 million.

2. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in $91.6 million of cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred revenue, and other accrued liabilities. Other accrued liabilities increased by $219.3 million, primarily due to an increase in income tax payable as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service revenue that is being recognized as revenue over the service contract period, increased by $52.8 million primarily due to the higher number of installed systems for which service contracts existed. Accrued compensation and employee benefits increased by $31.2 million. Accounts payable increased by $14.0 million. The favorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by an increase of $115.5 million in inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant, and equipment; an increase of $81.7 million in accounts receivable; and an increase of $28.5 million in prepaids and other assets. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily driven by higher revenue and timing of collections. The increase in prepaids and other assets

was primarily driven by higher lease receivable balances resulting from sales-type lease arrangement transactions entered into during the year ended December 31, 2017.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by our operating activities of $1,087.0 million exceeded our net income of $735.9 million primarily due certain to non-cash charges as outlined below:

-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Our net income included non-cash charges including in the form of share-based compensation of $177.6 million; depreciation and loss of disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $73.9 million; investment related non-cash charges of $35.9 million; deferred income tax of $18.7 million; and amortization of intangible assets of $18.2 million.

2. The non-cash charges outlined above were partly offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $3.0 million of cash used by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses, deferred revenue, and other accrued liabilities. Inventory, including the transfer of equipment from inventory to property, plant and equipment, increased by $46.7 million. Accounts receivable increased $35.9 million primarily driven by higher revenue and timing of collections. Prepaids and other assets increased $28.7 million primarily driven by higher lease receivable balances resulting from sales-type lease arrangement transactions entered into during year ended December 31, 2016. The unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by a $53.8 million increase in other liabilities, primarily due to higher income tax payable, a $19.9 million increase in deferred revenue, an $18.7 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits, and a $15.9 million increase in accounts payable. Deferred revenue, which includes deferred service revenue that is being recognized as revenue over the service contract period, increased primarily due to the increase in the number of installed systems for which service contracts existed.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by our operating activities of $806.2 million exceeded our net income of $588.8 million for two primary reasons:

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Our net income included non-cash charges primarily in the form of share-based compensation of $167.9 million, depreciation and loss of disposal of property, plant, and equipment of $65.1 million, amortization of intangible assets of $24.4 million, and investment related non-cash charges of $26.4 million.

2. The non-cash charges outlined above were partly offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $92.5 million of cash used by operating activities. Operating assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of accounts receivable, inventory, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities, and prepaid expenses. Accounts receivable increased $79.2 million in 2015 reflecting higher sales in 2015 and timing of sales and collections. Prepaids and other assets increased $10.5 million primarily driven by higher lease receivable balances resulting from sales-type lease arrangements entered into in 2015. Accrued liabilities decreased by $10.5 million mainly due to settlement payments made related to accrued product liability litigation. Other changes in operating assets and liabilities include an inventory increase of $10.7 million, net of equipment transfers from inventory to property, plant and equipment, and a decrease in accounts payable of $11.3 million also resulted in cash used by operating activities. The unfavorable impact of these items on cash provided by operating activities was partly offset by a $21.5 million increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits and an $8.2 million increase of deferred revenue.

Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, consisted of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments (net of purchases of investments) of $569.4 million partly offset by purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $190.7 million.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, consisted of purchases of investments (net of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments) of $1.2 billion and purchases of property, plant, and equipment for $53.9 million.
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, consisted of purchases of investments (net of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments) of $768.5 million and purchases of property, plant, and equipment for $81.0 million.
We invest predominantly in high quality, fixed income securities. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities, taxable and tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, non-U.S. government agency securities, cash deposits, and money market funds.

Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities during 2017 primarily consisted of $2,274.0 million related to an accelerated share buyback program executed and settled during 2017 that is further described in “Note 8. Stockholders' Equity” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of

vested employee equity awards of $56.6 million. These uses partly offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $415.5 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2016 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $580.9 million, partly offset by $42.5 million used for the repurchase of 0.2 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of vested employee equity awards of $24.0 million.
Net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases of $361.1 million, partly offset by $183.7 million used for the repurchase of 1.1 million shares of our common stock through open market transactions and taxes paid on behalf of employees related to net share settlement of vested employee equity awards of $11.0 million.
Our cash requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our products, the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products, and other factors. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to expand procedure adoption and acceptance of our products. We have made substantial investments in our commercial operations, product development activities, facilities, and intellectual property. Based upon our business model, we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances, together with income to be derived from the sale of our products, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements beyond one year and for the foreseeable future.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):

------------------------------------ ---------------------- ----- --------------- ----- ------------ ----- ------------ ----------------- ---- ----- ---- - -----

 Payments due by period
 Total Less than1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years
Operating leases $ 41.6 $ 8.2 $ 10.2 $ 6.4 $ 16.8
Purchase commitments and obligations 478.1 466.3 11.8 — —
Other 270.2 21.6 43.2 43.2 162.2
Total $ 789.9 $ 496.1 $ 65.2 $ 49.6 $ 179.0

Operating leases. We lease spaces for operations in the U.S. as well as in Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and other foreign countries. We also lease automobiles for certain sales and field service employees. Operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our non-cancellable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year.
Purchase commitments and obligations. These amounts include an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above.
Other. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above. Due to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, we estimated a provisional obligation associated with a one-time deemed repatriation toll charge to be $270.2 million, which will be paid in installments over eight years. This provisional amount, as well as the current estimated timing of payments, is subject to change based on additional guidance from and interpretations by U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies and changes in assumptions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions. See “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which is included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” which describes our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Our most critical accounting estimates include:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the valuation and recognition of investments, which impacts our investment portfolio balance when we assess fair value, and interest and other income, net, when we record impairments;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the valuation of revenue and allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts, which impacts revenue;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the estimation of transactions to hedge, which impacts revenue and other expense;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
• the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit margins;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the assessment of recoverability of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives, which primarily impacts gross profit margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their amortization;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, which impacts gross profit margin and operating expenses;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes (including the measurement of uncertain tax positions), which impact our provision for taxes; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the estimate of probable loss associated with product liability claims, which impacts accrued liabilities and operating expenses.

Investments Valuation
Fair Value. Our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in U.S. treasuries and U.S. government agency securities, non-U.S. government securities, taxable and/or tax exempt municipal notes, corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper, cash deposits, and money market funds. The assessment of the fair value of investments can be difficult and subjective. U.S. GAAP establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. Each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value. Valuation of Level 1 and 2 instruments generally do not require significant management judgment and the estimation is not difficult. Level 3 instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. There were no Level 3 securities for the periods presented.
Other-than-temporary impairment. After determining the fair value of our available-for-sales instruments, gains or losses on these securities are recorded to other comprehensive income, until either the security is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other-than-temporary. The primary differentiating factors we considered in classifying impairments as either temporary or other-than-temporary impairments are our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the length of the time and the extent to which the market value of the investment has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. These judgments could prove to be wrong, and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations.
No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. As of December 31, 2017, and 2016, net unrealized losses on investments of $11.3 million and $8.6 million, net of tax, respectively, were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts. We record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances. As a result, management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue. In making such estimates, management analyzes historical returns, current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of reported revenue could result.
Similarly, we make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable, especially analyzing the aging and nature of accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends, and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sales transactions before shipment is authorized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates, material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result.

Hedge Accounting for Derivatives. We utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency denominated sales transactions and expenses. When specific criteria required by relevant accounting standards have been met, changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. By their nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When we determine that the transactions are no longer probable within a certain time-frame, we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in the fair values of the related hedge contracts from OCI to net income.
Inventory valuation. Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual costs, or net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. The cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excessive or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
Intangible Assets. Our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill. Identifiable intangibles include developed technology, patents, distribution rights, customer relationships, and licenses. All of our identifiable intangibles have finite lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review (or more frequent if impairment indicators arise) by applying a fair-value based test. There have been no impairments from the analysis required by U.S. GAAP.
Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets. If the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future, we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
The valuation and classification of intangible assets and goodwill and the assignment of useful lives for purposes of amortization involves judgments and the use of estimates. The evaluation of these intangibles and goodwill for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on a recurring basis. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to the assumptions made. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated, we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets’ new, shorter useful lives. No impairment charge or accelerated amortization was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing impairment, which includes financial forecasts. If conditions are different from management’s current estimates, material write-downs of long-lived assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results.
Revenue recognition. Our system sale arrangements contain multiple elements, including system(s), system components, system accessories, instruments, accessories, and service. We generally deliver all of the elements, other than service, within days of entering into the system sale arrangement. Each of these elements is a separate unit of accounting. System accessories, instruments, accessories, and service are also sold on a stand-alone basis.
For multiple-element arrangements, revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices. Relative selling prices are based first on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), then on third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”) when VSOE does not exist, and then on management's best estimate of the selling price (“ESP”) when VSOE and TPE do not exist.
Our system sales arrangements generally include a one-year period of free service and four additional years of service that are generally billed for separately on an annual basis at a contractually stated price. The revenue allocated to the free service period is deferred and recognized ratably over the free service period. Amounts billed for the additional years of service are recorded into deferred revenue when they are billed and recognized ratably over the service period.
Because we have neither VSOE nor TPE for our systems, the allocation of revenue is based on ESP for the systems sold. The objective of ESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale, had the product been sold on a stand-alone basis. We determine ESP for our systems by considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the system, geographies, type of customer, and market conditions. We regularly review ESP and maintain internal controls over establishing and updating these estimates.
Accounting for stock options. We account for share-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term, and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. The assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value of stock options. Changes in expected risk-free rate of return do not significantly impact the calculation of fair value, and determining this input is not highly subjective.

55

Table of Contents

We use implied volatility based on freely traded options in the open market, as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility. In determining the appropriateness of relying on implied volatility, we considered the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
• the sufficiency of the trading volume of freely traded options;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the ability to reasonably match the terms, such as the date of the grant and the exercise price of the freely traded options to options granted; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the length of the term of the freely traded options used to derive implied volatility.

The expected term represents the weighted-average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the observed and expected time to exercise. We determine expected term based on historical exercise patterns and our expectation of the time it will take for employees to exercise options still outstanding.
We develop an estimate of the number of share-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share-based compensation, as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted. We estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than previously estimated forfeiture rate, we may make an adjustment that will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the period when the rate was changed. Adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods.
Changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock options and, consequently, the related amount of share-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Accounting for income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the current or subsequent period.
We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is less than a 50% likelihood, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be recoverable. As of December 31, 2017, we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets ultimately will be recovered with the exception of our California deferred tax assets. We believe that due to the computation of California taxes under the single sales factor, it is more likely than not that our California deferred tax assets will not be realized. Should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period in which such change takes place.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. If we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit, then the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We re-evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effective settlement of audit issues, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.
Accounting for legal contingencies. We are involved in a number of legal proceedings involving product liability, intellectual property, shareholder derivative actions, securities class actions, insurance, employee related, and other matters. We record a liability and related charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements for legal contingencies when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment is reevaluated each accounting period and is based on all available information, including discussion with any outside legal counsel that represents us. If a reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss cannot be made, but a range of probable losses can be estimated, the low-end of the range of losses is recognized if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

56

Table of Contents

When determining the estimated probable loss or range of losses, significant judgment is required to be exercised in order to estimate the amount and timing of the loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information. The final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict, and therefore, the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates. Consequently, new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.
