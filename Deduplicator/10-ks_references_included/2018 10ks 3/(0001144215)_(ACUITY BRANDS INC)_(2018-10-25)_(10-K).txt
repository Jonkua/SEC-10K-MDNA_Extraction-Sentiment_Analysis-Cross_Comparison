Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness, and other key financial information of Acuity Brands, Inc. (“Acuity Brands”) and its subsidiaries for the years ended August 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report.

Overview
Company
Acuity Brands is the parent company of Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. (“ABL”) and other subsidiaries (Acuity Brands, ABL, and such other subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the “Company”). The Company has its principal office in Atlanta, Georgia.
The Company is one of the world’s leading providers of lighting and building management solutions and services for commercial, institutional, industrial, infrastructure, and residential applications throughout North America and select international markets. The Company’s lighting and building management solutions include individual devices and integrated systems designed to optimize energy efficiency and comfort, enhance the occupant experience, and reduce operating costs for various indoor and outdoor applications.

As of August 31, 2018, the Company operates 19 manufacturing facilities and eight distribution facilities along with three warehouses to serve its extensive customer base and employs approximately 13,000 associates.
The Company does not consider acquisitions a critical element of its strategy but seeks opportunities to expand and enhance its portfolio of solutions, including the following transactions:

the unique capabilities and resources of the organization to drive profitable growth through a keen focus on providing comprehensive and differentiated lighting and building management solutions for its customers, driving world-class cost efficiency, and leveraging a culture of operational excellence through continuous improvement.
Throughout fiscal 2018, the Company believes it made progress towards achieving its strategic objectives, including expanding its access to the market, expanding its addressable market, introducing new lighting and building management solutions, and enhancing its operations to create a stronger, more effective organization. The strategic objectives were developed to enable the Company to meet or exceed the following financial goals during an entire business cycle:

- ---------------------------------------------------
• Operating profit margin in the mid-teens or higher;

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• Diluted earnings per share growth in excess of 15% per annum;

- --------------------------------------------------------------
• Return on stockholders’ equity of 20% or better per annum; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures, that is in excess of net income.

To increase the probability of the Company achieving these financial goals, management will continue to implement programs to enhance its capabilities at providing unparalleled customer service; creating a globally competitive cost structure; improving productivity; and introducing innovative solutions and services more rapidly and cost effectively. In addition, the Company has invested considerable resources to teach and train associates to utilize tools and techniques that accelerate success in these key areas, as well as to create a culture that demands excellence through continuous improvement. Additionally, the Company promotes a “pay-for-performance” culture that rewards various levels of year-over-year improvement, while closely monitoring appropriate risk-taking. The expected outcome of these activities will be to better position the Company to deliver on its full potential, to provide a platform for future growth opportunities, and to allow the Company to achieve its long-term financial goals. See the Outlook section below for additional information.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company's principal sources of liquidity are operating cash flows generated primarily from its business operations, cash on hand, and various sources of borrowings. The ability of the Company to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to fund its operations and capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, meet its obligations as they become due, and maintain compliance with covenants contained in its financing agreements.
The Company invested $43.6 million in fiscal 2018 for capital expenditures, primarily for new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology. The Company expects to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures during fiscal 2019.
The Company's short-term cash needs are expected to include funding operations as currently planned, making anticipated capital investments, paying quarterly stockholder dividends as currently anticipated, paying principal and interest on borrowings as currently scheduled, making required contributions to its employee benefit plans, funding possible acquisitions, and potentially repurchasing up to 5.2 million shares of its outstanding common stock as authorized by the the Board of Directors (the “Board”). Management believes that the Company will be able to meet its liquidity needs over the next 12 months based on its cash on hand, current projections of cash flow from operations, and borrowing availability under recently executed financing arrangements. Additionally, management believes that the Company’s cash flows from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, future borrowings and capacity, will sufficiently support the long-term liquidity needs of the Company.
In March 2018, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to six million shares of the Company's common stock. As of August 31, 2018, 0.8 million shares had been purchased under this authorization. Additionally, the Company repurchased 1.2 million shares during the current year under previous authorizations from the Board, resulting in total repurchases during fiscal 2018 of two million shares. The extent and timing of future stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including stock price, company performance, expected future market conditions, and other possible uses of cash, including acquisitions. The Company may increase its leverage to accommodate the stock repurchase program.
Cash Flow
The Company uses available cash and cash flow from operations, borrowings on credit arrangements, and proceeds from the exercise of stock options, to fund operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions; to repurchase Company stock; and to pay dividends.

The Company’s cash position at August 31, 2018 was $129.1 million, a decrease of $182.0 million from August 31, 2017. During the year ended August 31, 2018, the Company generated net cash flows from operating activities of $353.2 million. Cash generated from operating activities, as well as cash on-hand, was used during the current year primarily to repurchase two million shares of the Company's outstanding common stock for $298.4 million, to fund acquisitions of $163.2 million, to fund capital expenditures of $43.6 million, to pay dividends to stockholders of $21.4 million, and to pay employee taxes of $8.2 million on the net settlement of equity awards. Additionally, the Company fully repaid all borrowings under its revolving credit facility during fiscal 2018.
During fiscal 2018, net cash generated from operating activities increased $16.6 million to $353.2 million compared with $336.6 million in the prior-year period due primarily to lower net working capital requirements, which reflect reduced variable incentive payments for prior year performance and payments for income taxes, partially offset by lower operating profit. Operating working capital (calculated by adding accounts receivable plus inventories, and subtracting accounts payable-net of acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes) increased by approximately $84.7 million during fiscal 2018 compared to an increase of $34.3 million during fiscal 2017. Operating working capital requirements increased primarily due to greater production and purchases necessary to support the higher level of net sales. The increase in inventory during the year was due primarily to customer expansion in the home center channel, new product launches, and a buildup of finished goods to support committed projects in the corporate accounts channel. This increase in inventory was mostly offset by a corresponding increase in accounts payable during the same period. Additionally, the increase in accounts receivable during the year was due primarily to the timing of cash collections from customers.
Management believes that investing in assets and programs that will over time increase the overall return on its invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value. The Company invested $43.6 million and $67.3 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily for new equipment, tooling, facility enhancements, and information technology. The Company expects to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures during fiscal 2019.

___________________________

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) These amounts, which represent the principal amounts outstanding at August 31, 2018, are included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote for additional information regarding debt and other matters.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) These amounts represent primarily the expected future interest payments on outstanding debt held by the Company at August 31, 2018 and the Company’s outstanding loans related to its corporate-owned life insurance policies (“COLI”), which constitute a small portion of the total contractual obligations shown. COLI-related interest payments included in this table are estimates. These estimates are based on various assumptions, including age at death, loan interest rate, and tax bracket. The amounts in this table do not include COLI-related payments after ten years due to the difficulty in calculating a meaningful estimate that far in the future. Note that payments related to debt and the COLI are reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) The Company’s operating lease obligations are described in the Commitments and Contingencies footnote.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Purchase obligations include commitments to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) These amounts are included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and largely represent liabilities for which the Company is obligated to make future payments under certain long-term employee benefit programs. Estimates of the amounts and timing of these amounts are based on various assumptions, including expected return on plan assets, interest rates, and other variables. The amounts in this table do not include amounts related to future funding obligations under the defined benefit pension plans. The amount and timing of these future funding obligations are subject to many variables and are also dependent on whether or not the Company elects to make contributions to the pension plans in excess of those required under Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Such voluntary contributions may reduce or defer the funding obligations. See the Pension and Profit Sharing Plans footnote for additional information. These amounts exclude $4.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits as the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities cannot be reasonably estimated.

Table of Contents

The above table does not include deferred income tax liabilities of approximately $168.5 million as of August 31, 2018. Refer to the Income Taxes footnote for more information. This amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because the Company believes this presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.
Capitalization
The current capital structure of the Company is comprised principally of senior unsecured notes and equity of its stockholders. Total debt outstanding was $356.8 million and $356.9 million at August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectfully, and consisted primarily of fixed-rate obligations. The Company fully repaid all borrowings under its revolving credit facility during fiscal 2018. Additionally, the Company repaid $0.4 million under the fixed rate long-term bank loans during fiscal 2018.
On December 8, 2009, ABL issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes due in fiscal 2020 (the “Unsecured Notes”) in a private placement transaction. The Unsecured Notes were subsequently exchanged for SEC-registered notes with substantially identical terms. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and were issued at a price equal to 99.797% of their face value and for a term of 10 years. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
On June 29, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks that provides the Company with a $400.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $400.0 million unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (“Term Loan Facility”). The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of August 31, 2018. At August 31, 2018, the Company had additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement of $794.7 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect , which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility less the outstanding letters of credit of $5.3 million issued. As of August 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $10.2 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under the Company's casualty insurance programs and for providing credit support for the Company’s industrial revenue bond, including $5.3 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
During fiscal 2018, the Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity increased $51.2 million to $1.72 billion at August 31, 2018 from $1.67 billion at August 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to net income earned in the period, stock issuances resulting primarily from the exercise of stock options, and actuarial gains on pension plans, partially offset by share repurchases, the payment of dividends, shares withheld for employee taxes on vested restricted stock grants, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company’s debt to total capitalization ratio (calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total stockholders’ equity) was 17.2% and 17.6% at August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The ratio of debt, net of cash, to total capitalization, net of cash, was 11.7% and 2.7% at August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Dividends
Acuity Brands paid dividends on its common stock of $21.4 million ($0.52 per share) in fiscal 2018 and $22.7 million ($0.52 per share) in fiscal 2017, indicating a quarterly dividend rate of $0.13 per share. All decisions regarding the declaration and payment of dividends by Acuity Brands are at the discretion of the Company’s Board and are evaluated regularly in light of the Company’s financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, and any other factors the Board deems relevant.

Net sales increased $175.0 million, or 5.0%, to $3.68 billion for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared with $3.51 billion reported for the year ended August 31, 2017. For the year ended August 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $349.6 million compared with $321.7 million for the year ended August 31, 2017, an increase of $27.9 million, or 8.7%. For fiscal 2018, diluted earnings per share increased 14.7% to $8.52 from $7.43 for the prior-year period.
The following table reconciles certain U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) financial measures to the corresponding non-U.S. GAAP measures referred to in the discussion of the Company’s results of operations, which exclude the impact of acquisition-related items, excess inventory adjustments, certain manufacturing inefficiencies, amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, special charges associated primarily with continued efforts to streamline the organization, a gain associated with the sale of the Company's Spanish lighting business, a gain on the sale of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate, and certain discrete income tax benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). Although the impacts of these items have been recognized in prior periods and could recur in future periods, management typically excludes these items during internal reviews of performance and uses these non-U.S. GAAP measures for baseline comparative operational analysis, decision making, and other activities. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including adjusted gross profit and margin, adjusted selling, distribution, and administrative (“SD&A”) expenses, adjusted operating profit and margin, adjusted other expense, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, are provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance. Specifically, the Company believes these non-U.S. GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the Company's results of operations. The non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended August 31, 2018 increased by 5.0% compared with the prior-year period due primarily to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 7% and an approximately 1% favorable impact of acquired revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of an unfavorable change in product prices and the mix of products sold (“price/mix”) of approximately 3%. Sales of LED-based luminaires during the year ended August 31, 2018 accounted for approximately two-thirds of total net sales. The increase in volumes was due primarily to greater shipments of Atrius-based luminaires to customers in certain key vertical applications and higher shipments within the home center channel. The net unfavorable price/mix was primarily due to lower pricing on certain luminaires as a result of increased competition in portions of the market for more basic, lesser-featured products; changes in product mix reflecting the substitution of certain products with less costly form factors resulting in lower price points; and changes in sales channel mix, which reflected fewer large commercial projects that generally include higher priced solutions. Due to the changing dynamics of the Company's product portfolio, including the increase of integrated lighting and building management solutions, it is not possible to precisely quantify or differentiate the individual components of volume, price, and mix.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for fiscal 2018 increased $5.6 million, or 0.4%, to $1.49 billion compared with $1.48 billion for the prior year. Gross profit margin decreased to 40.4% for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared with 42.3% for the year ended August 31, 2017. Gross profit margin was lower than the prior-year period primarily due to unfavorable price/mix; higher material, component, and freight costs; increased wages; and additional reserves for excess inventory related to the closure of a facility. These declines were partially offset by higher sales volumes, productivity improvements, and gross profit attributable to acquisitions. Adjusted gross profit for fiscal 2018 increased $8.8 million, or 0.6%, to $1.49 billion compared with $1.48 billion for the prior year. Adjusted gross profit margin decreased 180 basis points to 40.5% compared to 42.3% in the prior year.
Operating Profit
SD&A expenses for the year ended August 31, 2018 increased $75.5 million, or 7.9%, to $1.03 billion compared with $951.1 million in the prior year. The increase in SD&A expenses was primarily due to higher employee related costs, including additional headcount from acquisitions, increased freight charges and commissions to support greater sales volume, higher professional fees related to recent acquisitions, and to a lesser degree, certain other operating expenses. Compared with the prior-year period, SD&A expenses as a percent of sales increased 80 basis points to 27.9% for fiscal 2018 from 27.1% in fiscal 2017. Adjusted SD&A expenses were $963.7 million, or 26.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2018 compared to $891.1 million, or 25.4% of net sales, in the year-ago period.
During the year ended August 31, 2018, the Company recognized pre-tax special charges of $5.6 million compared with pre-tax special charges of $11.3 million recorded during the year ended August 31, 2017. Further details regarding the Company's special charges are included in the Special Charge footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating profit for fiscal 2018 was $454.6 million compared with $518.8 million reported for the prior-year period, a decrease of $64.2 million, or 12.4%. Operating profit margin decreased 240 basis points to 12.4% for fiscal 2018 compared with 14.8% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in operating profit was due primarily to the impact of price/mix on gross profit as well as higher SD&A expenses, partially offset by higher sales volumes and a lower net special charge.
Adjusted operating profit decreased $63.8 million, or 10.8%, to $527.9 million compared with $591.7 million for fiscal 2017. Adjusted operating profit margin was 14.3% and 16.9% for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Other Expense (Income)
Other expense (income) for the Company consists principally of net interest expense and net miscellaneous expense (income), which includes gains and losses related to foreign exchange rate changes. Interest expense, net, was $33.5 million and $32.5 million for the years ended August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company reported net miscellaneous income of $4.8 million in fiscal 2018 compared with net miscellaneous income of $6.3 million in fiscal 2017. Net miscellaneous income included a gain of $5.4 million associated with the sale of the Company’s Spanish lighting business and a gain of $7.2 million associated with the sale of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Income Taxes and Net Income
The Company's effective income tax rate was 17.9% and 34.7% for the years ended August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended August 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by the provisions of the TCJA, which was enacted during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Further details regarding the TCJA are included in the Income Taxes footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 will be approximately 25% before any discrete items, assuming the rates in its taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
Net income for fiscal 2018 increased $27.9 million, or 8.7%, to $349.6 million from $321.7 million reported for the prior year. The increase in net income resulted primarily from the benefit recognized related to the TCJA, partially offset by a decrease in operating profit. Adjusted net income for fiscal 2018 decreased 0.8% to $362.9 million compared with $365.9 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 was $8.84 compared with $8.45 for the prior-year period, which represented an increase of $0.39, or 4.6%.

Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended August 31, 2017 increased by 6.5% compared with the prior-year period due primarily to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 6% and an approximately 2% favorable impact of acquired revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of an unfavorable change in product prices and the mix of products sold (“price/mix”) of approximately 1%. Sales of LED-based luminaires during the year ended August 31, 2017 accounted for approximately two-thirds of total net sales. The change in price/mix was due primarily to changes in the mix of products sold and lower pricing on luminaires, reflecting the decline in certain LED component costs. Due to the changing dynamics of the Company's product portfolio, including the increase of integrated lighting and building management solutions, it is not possible to precisely quantify or differentiate the individual components of volume, price, and mix.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for fiscal 2017 increased $45.0 million, or 3.1%, to $1.48 billion compared with $1.44 billion for the prior year. Gross profit margin decreased to 42.3% for the year ended August 31, 2017 compared with 43.6% for the year ended August 31, 2016. This margin decline was primarily attributable to increased manufacturing expenses driven largely by higher wages and freight costs as well as higher quality costs, partially offset by the additional contribution on higher net sales. Materials and component costs were favorable as declining prices for certain LED components were only partially offset by rising costs for certain commodities, including steel. Gross profit margin was negatively impacted by unfavorable price/mix. Adjusted gross profit for fiscal 2017 increased $43.8 million, or 3.0%, to $1.48 billion compared with $1.44 billion for the prior year. Adjusted gross profit margin decreased 140 basis points to 42.3% compared to 43.7% in the prior year.
Operating Profit
SD&A expenses for the year ended August 31, 2017 increased $5.1 million, or 0.5%, to $951.1 million compared with $946.0 million in the prior year. The increase in SD&A expenses was due primarily to higher costs related to freight, commissions, and investments in additional headcount, which reflects the Company's investments in capabilities related to areas of future growth and enhanced customer service, as well as additional costs associated with acquired businesses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Compared with the prior-year period, SD&A expenses as a percent of sales decreased 160 basis points to 27.1% for fiscal 2017 from 28.7% in fiscal 2016. Adjusted SD&A expenses were $891.1 million, or 25.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2017 compared to $883.8 million, or 26.9% of net sales, in the year-ago period.
During the year ended August 31, 2017, the Company recognized pre-tax special charges of $11.3 million, which consisted primarily of severance and employee-related benefit costs for the elimination of certain operations and positions following a realignment of the Company’s operating structure, including positions within various SD&A departments. During fiscal 2016, the Company recognized pre-tax special charges of $15.0 million. These charges related primarily to the Company's continued efforts to integrate recent acquisitions and to streamline the organization by realigning certain responsibilities primarily within various SD&A departments, as well as the consolidation of certain production activities. Further details regarding the Company's special charges are included in the Special Charge footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating profit for fiscal 2017 was $518.8 million compared with $475.2 million reported for the prior-year period, an increase of $43.6 million, or 9.2%. Operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 14.8% for fiscal 2017 compared with 14.4% for fiscal 2016 due primarily to an increase in sales volume, lower material and component costs, and lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses, greater freight and commission costs, investments in additional headcount, and increased amortization of acquired intangible assets. Additionally, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.1 million during fiscal 2016; no such charges were recorded during fiscal 2017.
Adjusted operating profit increased $36.5 million, or 6.6%, to $591.7 million compared with $555.2 million for fiscal 2016. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.9% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016.
Other Expense (Income)
Other expense (income) for the Company consists principally of net interest expense and net miscellaneous expense (income), which includes gains and losses related to foreign exchange rate changes. Interest expense, net, was $32.5 million and $32.2 million for the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company reported net miscellaneous income of $6.3 million in fiscal 2017 compared with net miscellaneous income of $1.6 million in

29

Table of Contents

fiscal 2016. Net miscellaneous income for the year ended August 31, 2017 included a gain of $7.2 million associated with the sale of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate.
Provision for Income Taxes and Net Income
The effective income tax rate was 34.7% and 34.6% for the years ended August 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Net income for fiscal 2017 increased $30.9 million, or 10.6%, to $321.7 million from $290.8 million reported for the prior year. The increase in net income resulted primarily from higher operating profit and higher miscellaneous income, partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes. Adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 increased 6.5% to $365.9 million compared with $343.7 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was $8.45 compared with $7.84 for the prior-year period, which represented an increase of $0.61, or 7.8%.

Outlook
Management continues to believe the execution of the Company's strategy will provide attractive opportunities for profitable growth over the long-term. The Company's strategy is to capitalize on market growth and share gain opportunities by continuing to expand and leverage its industry-leading lighting and building management solutions portfolio, coupled with its extensive market presence and financial strength, to produce attractive financial performance over the long-term.
Third-party forecasts and leading indicators suggest that the North American lighting market, the Company’s primary market, will increase in the low-single digit range in fiscal 2019. Management expects to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets that the Company serves by executing its strategies focused on growth opportunities for new construction and renovation projects, expansion into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the continued introduction of new lighting and building management solutions as part of the Company’s integrated, tiered solutions strategy, including leveraging its unique, technology driven solutions portfolio to capture market share in the nascent, but rapidly growing, market for data capture, analytics, and other services, assisting in transforming buildings and campuses from cost centers to strategic assets.
Management expects the pricing environment to continue to be challenging in portions of the market, particularly for more basic, lesser-featured products sold through certain sales channels as well as shifts in product mix, both of which are expected to continue to negatively impact net sales and margins. Management expects to continue to introduce products and solutions to more effectively compete in these portions of the market and to accelerate programs to reduce product costs in order to maintain the Company’s competitiveness and drive improved profitability.
The U.S. federal government has recently imposed tariffs on certain Chinese imports. Certain components used in the Company’s products as well as certain sourced finished products are sourced from China and are impacted by the recently imposed tariffs. Management’s efforts to mitigate the impact of these added costs include a variety of activities, such as finding alternative suppliers, in-sourcing the production of certain products, and raising prices. Management believes that its mitigation activities, including recently announced price increases once fully enacted, will assist to offset the added costs. The Company’s margins may continue to be negatively impacted, particularly in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, due to a delay in the full realization of the expected benefits from the mitigation activities. Future U.S. policy changes that may be implemented, including additional tariffs, could have a positive or negative consequence on the Company’s financial performance depending on how the changes influence many factors, including business and consumer sentiment.
During fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a pre-tax special charge primarily related to the planned consolidation of certain facilities and associated reduction in employee workforce. The special charge consisted primarily of severance and employee-related benefit costs. Management expects to incur additional costs in future periods associated with the closing of facilities, primarily attributable to early lease termination costs and relocation costs. Annual savings realized from the streamlining activities, once fully completed, are expected to exceed the amount of the special charge, and the Company expects to reinvest portions thereof in activities to support higher-growth opportunities as well as drive improved profitability.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that increased the Company’s borrowing capacity under such agreement from $250 million to $800 million. The increase in borrowing capacity provides the Company with the resources to support growth opportunities, including acquisitions, and accommodate the current stock repurchase program of which 5.2 million shares remain available for repurchase. The extent and timing of actual stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including stock price, company performance, expected future market conditions, and other possible uses of cash, including acquisitions. The Company may increase its leverage to accommodate the stock repurchase program.

Table of Contents

Management expects the TCJA that was passed on December 22, 2017, to favorably impact the Company’s net income, diluted earnings per share, and cash flows in future periods, due primarily to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for periods beginning January 1, 2018. Additionally, positive business sentiment and other favorable aspects of the new tax law could incentivize additional investments in facilities and infrastructure in the U.S. that may increase future demand in the end-markets that the Company serves. Management currently estimates that the Company’s fiscal 2019 blended consolidated effective income tax rate before discrete items will approximate 25%. The estimated tax rate may differ from actual results, possibly materially, due to changes in interpretations of the TCJA and assumptions made by the Company, as well as guidance that may be issued and actions the Company may take as a result of the TCJA.
From a longer term perspective, management expects that the Company’s addressable markets have the potential to experience solid growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the IoT through the use of intelligent networked lighting and building automation systems that can collect and exchange data to increase efficiency as well as provide a host of other economic benefits resulting from data analytics. Management remains positive about the future prospects of the Company and its ability to outperform the markets it serves.
Accounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2018 and Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted
See the New Accounting Pronouncements footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted and upcoming standards.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As discussed in the Description of Business and Basis of Presentation footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition; inventory valuation; depreciation, amortization, and the recoverability of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets; share-based payment expense; medical, product warranty and recall, and other reserves; retirement benefits; and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. See the Significant Accounting Policies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the accounting policies of the Company.
Management believes the following represent the Company’s critical accounting estimates:
Revenue Recognition
The Company records revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the Company’s price to the customer is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. In the period of revenue recognition, provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, product returns, and discounts to customers are estimated and recorded, in most instances, as a reduction of revenue. The Company also maintains one-time or on-going marketing and trade-promotion programs with certain customers that require the Company to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs. These items are estimated based on customer agreements, historical trends, and expected demand. Actual results could differ from estimates, which would require adjustments to accrued amounts. See the Significant Accounting Policies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these assumptions and estimates.
Inventories
Inventories include materials, direct labor, in-bound freight, and related manufacturing overhead and are stated at the lower of cost (on a first-in, first-out or average-cost basis) or market. Management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions. A significant change in customer demand, market conditions, or technology could render

31

Table of Contents

certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operating results in the period the change occurs.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter or on an interim basis, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived asset is below its carrying value. All other long-lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss for goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value, which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or another appropriate fair value method. The evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates in accordance with U.S. GAAP including, but not limited to, economic, industry, and company-specific qualitative factors, projected future net sales, operating results, and cash flows.
Although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are reasonable, differences between actual and expected net sales, operating results, and cash flows and/or changes in the discount rate or theoretical royalty rate could cause these assets to be deemed impaired. If this were to occur, the Company would be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings for the write-down in value of such assets, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position but not its cash flows from operations.
Goodwill
The Company is comprised of one reporting unit with a goodwill balance of $970.6 million as of August 31, 2018. During fiscal 2018, the Company utilized a qualitative assessment of the fair value of goodwill as of June 1, 2018. To perform this assessment, the Company identified and analyzed macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, and company-specific factors. Additionally, factors that would have the greatest impact on the fair value of the Company were compared to those used in the previous quantitative impairment test performed as of June 1, 2017 to identify potentially significant variances to the reasonableness of the assumptions. Taking into consideration these factors, the Company estimated the potential change in the fair value of goodwill compared with the previous quantitative impairment test. As a result of the analysis performed, management believes the estimated fair value of the reporting unit continues to exceed its carrying value by a substantial margin and does not represent a more likely than not possibility of potential impairment. The goodwill analysis did not result in an impairment charge.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of eight trade names with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $144.3 million. Management utilized significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of these indefinite-lived trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows (“fair value model”) in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Future cash flows associated with each of the Company’s indefinite-lived trade names are calculated by multiplying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name by estimated future net sales attributable to the relevant trade name. The present value of the resulting after-tax cash flow is management’s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names. This fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions, including estimated future net sales (including short and long-term growth rates), the royalty rate, and the discount rate.
Future net sales and short-term growth rates are estimated for each particular trade name based on management’s financial forecasts, which consider key business drivers, such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes, expected growth in the Company's addressable market, and general economic factors, such as credit availability and interest rates. The long-term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at 3% and is based primarily on the Company’s understanding of projections for expected long-term growth within its addressable market and historical long-term performance. The theoretical royalty rate is estimated primarily using management’s assumptions regarding the amount a willing third party would pay to use the particular trade name and is compared with market information for similar intellectual property within and outside of the industry. If future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts, the Company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model. A reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected future after-tax cash flows in the valuation model. The Company utilized a range of estimated discount rates between 9% and 16% as of June 1, 2018, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the current risk-free interest rate, beta, market risk premium, and entity specific size premium.

32

Table of Contents

During fiscal 2018, the Company performed an evaluation of the fair values of its indefinite-lived trade names. The Company’s expected revenues are based on the Company’s fiscal 2019 expectations and recent lighting, controls, and building management solutions market growth estimates for fiscal 2019 through 2023. The Company also included revenue growth estimates based on current initiatives expected to help the Company improve performance. During fiscal 2018, estimated theoretical royalty rates ranged between 1% and 4%. The indefinite-lived intangible asset analysis did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair values exceeded the carrying values for each of the trade names. However, the estimated fair value of one trade name exceeded its carrying value by a small margin. Management believes the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of this trade name were reasonable, and sensitivity analysis indicated that the trade name would likely not be impaired by a material amount if reasonably differing assumptions had been used. Any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analyses for the other trade names, including revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates, would not be material to the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
The Company evaluates the remaining useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. The Company considers each reporting period whether an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the definite-lived asset is below its carrying value. The Company recorded no impairment charges for its definite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2018 or 2017.
Self-Insurance
The Company self-insures, up to certain limits, traditional risks including workers’ compensation, comprehensive general liability, and auto liability. A provision for claims under this self-insured program, based on the Company’s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred, is revised and recorded annually. The estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including, but not limited to, the Company’s independent actuary. The actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources including, among others, changes in claim reporting patterns, claim settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation, and economic conditions. Although the Company believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the Company’s self-insurance obligations, future expense, and cash flow. The Company is also self-insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks, primarily physical loss to property and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting two days or more in duration. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company is fully self-insured for certain other types of liabilities, including environmental, product recall, warranty, and patent infringement.
The Company is also self-insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans up to certain limits. The Company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the Company’s historical claims and administrative cost experience. The appropriateness of the Company’s lag factor is evaluated and revised, if necessary, annually. Although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to claim reporting patterns, plan design, legislation, and general economic conditions could materially affect the Company’s medical benefit plan liabilities, future expense, and cash flow.
Retirement Benefits
The Company sponsors domestic and international defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, and other postretirement plans. Assumptions are used to determine the estimated fair value of plan assets, the actuarial value of plan liabilities, and the current and projected costs for these employee benefit plans and include, among other factors, estimated discount rates, expected returns on the pension fund assets, estimated mortality rates, the rates of increase in employee compensation levels, and, for one international plan, retroactive inflationary adjustments. These assumptions are determined based on Company and market data and are evaluated annually as of the plans’ measurement date. See the Pensions and Defined Contribution Plans footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s plans, including the potential impact of changes to certain of these assumptions.
Share-based Payment Expense
The Company recognizes compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument issued. The Company accounts for stock options, restricted shares, and share units representing certain deferrals into the Director Deferred Compensation Plan or the

33

Table of Contents

Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan (both of which are discussed further in the Share-Based Payments footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) based on the grant-date fair value estimated under the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation — Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”).
The Company employs the Black-Scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of certain share-based awards and estimates forfeitures of all share-based awards at the time of grant, which are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If factors change causing different assumptions to be made in future periods, estimated compensation expense may differ significantly from that recorded in the current period. See the Significant Accounting Policies and Share-Based Payments footnotes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options.
During fiscal 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (“ASU 2016-09”), which changes certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees, particularly with respect to the presentation of excess tax benefits and deficiencies within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See the New Accounting Pronouncements footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Product Warranty and Recall Costs
The Company's products generally have a standard warranty term of five years. The Company records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized. Estimated future warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims. The Company is fully self-insured for product warranty costs. Historical warranty costs have been within expectations. The Company expects that historical activity will continue to be the best indicator of future warranty costs. There can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts or that incorporating new technologies, such as LED components into products, may not generate unexpected costs. Estimated costs related to product recalls based on a formal campaign soliciting repair or return of that product are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. If actual future warranty or recall costs exceed recorded amounts, additional allowances may be required, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flow.
Litigation
The Company recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims, actual costs could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flow.

['s effective income tax rate was 17.9% and 34.7% for the years ended August 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended August 31, 2018 was significantly impacted by the provisions of the TCJA, which was enacted during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Further details regarding the TCJA are included in the Income Taxes footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company estimates that its effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 will be approximately 25% before any discrete items, assuming the rates in its taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.
Net income for fiscal 2018 increased $27.9 million, or 8.7%, to $349.6 million from $321.7 million reported for the prior year. The increase in net income resulted primarily from the benefit recognized related to the TCJA, partially offset by a decrease in operating profit. Adjusted net income for fiscal 2018 decreased 0.8% to $362.9 million compared with $365.9 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 was $8.84 compared with $8.45 for the prior-year period, which represented an increase of $0.39, or 4.6%.

Net Sales
Net sales for the year ended August 31, 2017 increased by 6.5% compared with the prior-year period due primarily to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 6% and an approximately 2% favorable impact of acquired revenues from acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of an unfavorable change in product prices and the mix of products sold (“price/mix”) of approximately 1%. Sales of LED-based luminaires during the year ended August 31, 2017 accounted for approximately two-thirds of total net sales. The change in price/mix was due primarily to changes in the mix of products sold and lower pricing on luminaires, reflecting the decline in certain LED component costs. Due to the changing dynamics of the Company']:
NOTE 17. INDUSTRY SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our CEO, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. For fiscal 2017, we have the following reportable segments: - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ * Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere.

['s special charges are included in the Special Charge footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating profit for fiscal 2017 was $518.8 million compared with $475.2 million reported for the prior-year period, an increase of $43.6 million, or 9.2%. Operating profit margin increased 40 basis points to 14.8% for fiscal 2017 compared with 14.4% for fiscal 2016 due primarily to an increase in sales volume, lower material and component costs, and lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses, greater freight and commission costs, investments in additional headcount, and increased amortization of acquired intangible assets. Additionally, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $5.1 million during fiscal 2016; no such charges were recorded during fiscal 2017.
Adjusted operating profit increased $36.5 million, or 6.6%, to $591.7 million compared with $555.2 million for fiscal 2016. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.9% for both fiscal 2017 and 2016.

Adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 increased 6.5% to $365.9 million compared with $343.7 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 was $8.45 compared with $7.84 for the prior-year period, which represented an increase of $0.61, or 7.8%.
