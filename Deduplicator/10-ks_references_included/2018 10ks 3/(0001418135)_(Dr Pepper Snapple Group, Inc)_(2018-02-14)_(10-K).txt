You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including the factors we describe under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements", "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including documents incorporated by reference.
References in the following discussion to "we", "our", "us", "DPS" or "the Company" refer to Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. and all entities included in our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.
The periods presented in this section are the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, which we refer to as "2017", "2016" and "2015", respectively.
The following discussion does not reflect the Company's expectations with respect to its business, operations and financial performance following the completion of the Transaction. The Transaction is expected to have a material effect on such business, operations and financial performance. Accordingly, past performance may not be indicative of expected future results.

OVERVIEW
We are a leading integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor of non-alcoholic beverages in the U.S., Canada and Mexico with a diverse portfolio of flavored (non-cola) CSDs and NCBs, including ready-to-drink teas, juices, juice drinks, water and mixers. Our brand portfolio includes popular CSD brands such as Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Peñafiel, Squirt, 7UP, Crush, A&W, Sunkist soda and Schweppes, and NCB brands such as Snapple, Hawaiian Punch, Mott's, Clamato, Bai, Mr & Mrs T mixers and Rose's. Our largest brand, Dr Pepper, is a leading flavored CSD in the U.S. according to IRi. We have some of the most recognized beverage brands in North America, with significant consumer awareness levels and long histories that evoke strong emotional connections with consumers.
We operate as an integrated brand owner, manufacturer and distributor through our three segments. We believe our integrated business model strengthens our route-to-market and provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interests of our brand ownership and our manufacturing and distribution businesses through both our DSD system and our WD delivery system. Our integrated business model enables us to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of our large retail customers and allows us to more fully leverage our scale and reduce costs by creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage.
We operate primarily in the U.S., Mexico and Canada and we also distribute our products in the Caribbean. In 2017, 90% of our net sales were generated in the U.S., 7% in Mexico and the Caribbean and 3% in Canada.
UNCERTAINTIES AND TRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS
We believe the North American LRB market is influenced by certain key trends and uncertainties. Some of these items, such as increased health consciousness and changes in consumer preferences and economic factors, have created category headwinds for a number of our products during recent years. The key trends and uncertainties that could affect our business include:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changes in consumer preferences. We are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs. We believe marketing and product innovations that target fast growing population segments, such as the Hispanic community in the U.S., could drive market growth. Additionally, as more consumers are faced with a busy and on-the-go lifestyle, sales of single-serve beverages could increase, which typically have higher margins.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Allied brand relationships. Allied brands could terminate their distribution agreements, primarily as a result of ownership changes of these brand companies.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Volatility in the costs of raw materials. The costs of a substantial portion of the raw materials used in the beverage industry are dependent on commodity prices for resin, aluminum, diesel fuel, corn, apple juice concentrate, sucrose, natural gas and other commodities. We are also dependent on commodity prices for apples related to our applesauce production. Commodity price volatility has, from time to time, exerted pressure on industry margins and operating results.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increased government regulation. Government agencies, as a result of concerns about the public health consequences and health care costs associated with obesity, have been proposing and, in some cases, enacting new taxes or regulations on sugar-sweetened and diet beverages. Any changes of regulations or imposed taxes could reduce demand and/or cause us to raise our prices.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increased health consciousness. Consumers are increasingly becoming more concerned about health and wellness, focusing on caloric intake and sugar content in both regular CSDs and juices, the use of artificial sweeteners in diet CSDs and the use of natural, organic or simple ingredients in LRB products. We believe the main beneficiaries of this trend include bottled waters, naturally sweetened, low calorie drinks, all natural and organic beverages and ready-to-drink teas. Our completion of the Bai Brands Merger on January 31, 2017 will allow us to continue distribution and capture additional growth as a result of this key trend.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increased competition in the LRB market. A number of our competitors are large corporations with significant financial resources. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, which could reduce the demand for our products.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our Mexican and Canadian entities' functional currencies. We use derivative instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate a portion of our exposure in these expected future cash flows to changes in foreign exchange rates. Significant changes in these exchange rates will impact our results of operations.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Product and packaging innovation. We believe brand owners and bottling companies will continue to create new products and packages, such as beverages with new ingredients and new premium flavors and innovative convenient packaging, that address changes in consumer tastes and preferences.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Changing retailer landscape. As retailers continue to consolidate, we believe retailers will support consumer product companies that can provide an attractive portfolio of products, a strong value proposition and efficient delivery.

Refer to Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.
SEASONALITY
The beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. Our beverage sales are generally higher during the warmer months and also can be influenced by the timing of holidays as well as weather fluctuations.
SEGMENTS
As of December 31, 2017, we report our business in four operating segments:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Beverage Concentrates segment reflects sales of the Company's branded concentrates and syrup to third party bottlers primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the brands in this segment are carbonated soft drink brands.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Packaged Beverages Excluding Bai segment reflects sales in the U.S. and Canada from the manufacture and distribution of finished beverages and other products, including sales of the Company's own brands and third party brands, through both DSD and WD.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Bai segment reflects sales of Bai Brands finished goods to third party distributors, primarily in the U.S., as net sales to the Packaged Beverages Excluding Bai segment are eliminated in consolidation. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impact of Bai Brands Merger on the Company's net sales presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Latin America Beverages segment reflects sales in the Mexico, Caribbean, and other international markets from the manufacture and distribution of concentrates, syrup and finished beverages.

The Company has determined that Packaged Beverages Excluding Bai and Bai, which have been identified as operating segments, meet the aggregation criteria under U.S. GAAP. As such, these segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment, Packaged Beverages, based on similarities among the operating units including economic characteristics, the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the types or class of customer for their products and services, the methods used to distribute their products and services and the nature of the regulatory environment.

VOLUME
In evaluating our performance, we consider different volume measures depending on whether we sell beverage concentrates or finished beverages.
Beverage Concentrates Sales Volume
In our Beverage Concentrates segment, we measure our sales volume in two ways: (1) "concentrate case sales" and (2) "bottler case sales." The unit of measurement for both concentrate case sales and bottler case sales equals 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage, the equivalent of 24 twelve ounce servings.
Concentrate case sales represent units of measurement for concentrates sold by us to our bottlers and distributors. A concentrate case is the amount of concentrate needed to make one case of 288 fluid ounces of finished beverage. It does not include any other component of the finished beverage other than concentrate. Our net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on our sales of concentrate cases.
Although net sales in our concentrate businesses are based on concentrate case sales, we believe that bottler case sales are also a significant measure of our performance because they measure sales of packaged beverages into retail channels.
Packaged Beverages and Latin America Beverages Sales Volume
In our Packaged Beverages and Latin America Beverages segments, we measure volume as case sales to customers. A case sale represents a unit of measurement equal to 288 fluid ounces of packaged beverage sold by us. Case sales include both our owned brands and certain brands licensed to and/or distributed by us.
Volume in Bottler Case Sales
In addition to sales volume, we measure volume in bottler case sales ("volume (BCS)") as sales of packaged beverages, in equivalent 288 fluid ounce cases, sold by us and our bottling partners to retailers and independent distributors. Our contract manufacturing sales are not included or reported as part of volume (BCS).
Bottler case sales and concentrates and packaged beverage sales volumes are not equal during any given period due to changes in bottler concentrates inventory levels, which can be affected by seasonality, bottler inventory and manufacturing practices and the timing of price increases and new product introductions.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Executive Summary - 2017 Financial Overview and Recent Developments

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net income increased $229 million, driven primarily by the income tax benefits related to the impact of the recent federal tax law change and the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of the Bai Brands Merger, losses on early extinguishment of debt completed during the second and third quarter of 2017, and the unfavorable comparison to the gain on the extinguishment of a multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability recorded in the prior year.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On December 22, 2017, the federal government enacted the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA"). Under the TCJA, our U.S. federal statutory tax rate will be reduced from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018, with some related business deductions and credits either reduced or eliminated. As a result, we have recognized an income tax benefit of $297 million, primarily driven by the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities, which increased diluted earnings per share by $1.62 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2018, we believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 26%-27%.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On January 31, 2017, we completed the Bai Brands Merger. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the primary impacts of the Bai Brands Merger decreased diluted earnings per share in total by $0.26.

The drivers of this change include:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The interest expense associated with the financing to complete the Bai Brands Merger, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.18 for the year ended December 31, 2017;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The operations of Bai Brands, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.17 for the year ended December 31, 2017;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The associated transaction and integration expenses, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.08 for the year ended December 31, 2017;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The gain on the step-acquisition of Bai Brands, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.10 for the year ended December 31, 2017; and

31

Table of Contents

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The $21 million benefit as a result of the renegotiation of a manufacturing contract acquired during the Bai Brands Merger, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.07 for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The impact of the operations of Bai Brands includes:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The incremental profit margin benefit we experienced in the year ended December 31, 2017 as the brand owner for Bai Brands;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The acquired Bai Brands operations, which includes the shipments to third parties since the Bai Brands Merger, partially offset by the $9 million initial profit in stock adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2017 related to Bai Brands inventories; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ The associated purchase accounting adjustments (refer to Note 3 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information).

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we repurchased 4.4 million, 5.7 million, and 6.5 million shares of our common stock, respectively, valued at approximately $399 million in 2017, $519 million in 2016, and $521 million in 2015.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On January 5, 2018, the Company acquired a 5.4% equity interest in Core Organics LLC ("Core") for $18 million.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On January 29, 2018, DPS and Keurig announced that the companies have entered into the Merger Agreement to create Keurig Dr Pepper, a new beverage company of scale with a portfolio of iconic consumer brands and expanded distribution capability to reach virtually every point-of-sale in North America. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which has been unanimously approved by our Board, DPS shareholders will receive $103.75 per share in a special cash dividend and retain their shares in DPS.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During the first quarter of 2018, our Board declared a dividend of $0.58 per share, which will be paid on April 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of March 21, 2018.

In branded CSDs, Canada Dry increased 5% due to continued growth in the ginger ale category. Peñafiel increased 5% due to distribution gains, increased promotional activity and product innovation, partially offset by increased competition, in our Latin America Beverages segment, and Squirt increased 3%. Schweppes also grew by 3% due to continued growth in the ginger ale category. These increases were partially offset by a 2% decline in 7UP and a 2% decrease in A&W. Our other CSD brands were also 2% lower, led by Rockstar as a result of the loss of distribution rights beginning in April 2017. Dr Pepper was flat compared to the year ago period as increases in our fountain business were fully offset by declines in TEN and diet.
In branded NCBs, Bai increased 99% driven by the acquired Bai Brands shipments to third parties since the Bai Brands Merger and continued growth in our existing distribution as a result of distribution gains and product innovation. Our growth allied brands gained 40% due primarily to distribution gains for BODYARMOR, Core and Fiji, and product innovation for BODYARMOR. Clamato increased 3% compared with the year ago period. Mott's grew 1% as growth in our sauce products were partially offset by declines in juice. These increases were partially offset by a 3% decline in Snapple due to competitive headwinds, the de-emphasis on our value products, and lower promotional activity, partially offset by the launch of our new PET packaging for our 16 oz. bottles and the Takes 2 to Mango flavor innovation. Our other NCB brands were 4% lower compared to the prior period, led by Hawaiian Punch and AriZona.
Net Sales. Net sales increased $250 million, or approximately 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary drivers of the increase in net sales included:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in shipments, excluding the loss of the Rockstar distribution rights, which grew net sales by 2.0%;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
• Favorable product and package mix, which increased net sales by 1.5%;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $64 million of acquired Bai Brands shipments to third parties since the Bai Brands Merger, which raised net sales by 1.0%;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Higher pricing and lower discounts as a result of a favorable comparison of the annual true-up of our estimated customer incentive liability, which increased net sales by 0.5%;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
• Unfavorable segment mix, which reduced our net sales by 0.5%; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The loss of the Rockstar distribution rights, which lowered net sales by 0.5%.

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $137 million, or approximately 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross margin was 59.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the gross margin of 59.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following drivers impacted the gross margin:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Unfavorable product and package mix, which reduced our gross margin by 0.5%;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in our other manufacturing costs, which includes the impact of a $6 million default by a supplier of resin to our operations in Mexico, reduced our gross margin by 0.4%.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The unfavorable change in our last-in, first-out ("LIFO") inventory provision, driven primarily by apples, combined with higher commodity costs, led by packaging, reduced our gross margin by 0.4%;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Unfavorable foreign currency effects, which decreased our gross margin by 0.1%; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Increase in our gross margin of 0.7% related to the incremental profit margin benefit we experienced as a result of becoming the brand owner for Bai Brands and the acquired Bai Brands shipments to third parties since the Bai Brands Merger, partially offset by the $9 million initial profit in stock adjustment as a result of the Bai Brands Merger recorded during the first quarter of 2017;

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• Favorable segment mix, which raised our gross margin by 0.2%;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Higher pricing and lower discounts as a primary result of a favorable comparison of the annual true-up of our estimated customer incentive liability, which raised our gross margin by 0.2%; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Ongoing productivity improvements, which increased our gross margin by 0.2%.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased $227 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the prior year. The primary driver of the increase in SG&A expenses was the impact of the Bai Brands Merger, which includes $114 million of acquired operating costs, primarily $59 million of marketing investments as well as people costs, and $20 million in transaction expenses. Other drivers of the increase include higher people costs, driven by inflationary increases and additional frontline labor investment, a $31 million unfavorable comparison in the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts, and an $11 million increase in planned organic marketing investments. These increases were partially offset by lower incentive compensation.

33

Table of Contents

The unfavorable mark-to-market comparison on commodity derivative contracts within SG&A expenses, which is included in unallocated corporate costs, was driven by no unrealized gains or losses for the year ended December 31, 2017, versus $31 million in unrealized gains in the year ago period.
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net. Other operating (income) expense, net had a favorable change of $48 million due primarily to the $28 million gain on the step-acquisition of Bai Brands and the $21 million benefit as a result of the renegotiation of a manufacturing contract acquired during the Bai Brands Merger. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Income from Operations. Income from operations decreased $45 million to $1,388 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to the increase in SG&A expenses, partially offset by the increase in gross profit and the favorable change in other operating (income) expense, net.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to the higher average debt balance associated with the senior unsecured notes issued late in the fourth quarter of 2016 to fund the Bai Brands Merger, partially offset by interest savings associated with the tender offer for the 6.82% senior notes due May 1, 2018 ("2018 Notes") and the 7.45% senior notes due May 1, 2038 (the "2038 Notes") during the second quarter of 2017 and the redemption of the remaining 2018 Notes during the third quarter of 2017. These transactions were effectively refinanced by the issuance of other senior unsecured notes at a lower interest rate.
Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In June 2017, we completed a tender offer on a portion of our 2038 Notes and 2018 Notes and retired, at a premium, an aggregate principal amount of $125 million of the 2038 Notes and $63 million of the 2018 Notes. The loss on early extinguishment of the 2038 and 2018 Notes was $49 million, which was comprised of $62 million for the tender offer consideration, the early tender premium and write off of deferred financing costs, partially offset by a $13 million gain on the termination of an interest rate swap related to the 2038 Notes.
In July 2017, we recognized a $13 million loss on early extinguishment of debt as we completed a redemption of our remaining 2018 Notes and retired, at a premium, an aggregate principal amount of $301 million of the 2018 Notes. The $13 million loss on early extinguishment of debt was comprised of the make-whole premium and write off of deferred financing costs.
In October 2016, we redeemed a portion of the 2018 Notes and retired, at a premium, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $360 million with the proceeds from the issuance of our 2.55% senior notes due on September 15, 2026 (the "2026 Notes"). The loss on early extinguishment of the 2018 Notes, which primarily represented the redemption premium, was approximately $31 million.
Other Income, Net. Other income, net decreased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the unfavorable comparison to a $21 million gain on the extinguishment of a multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability recorded in the prior year.
Effective Tax Rate. The effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 8.1% and 33.8%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes included an income tax benefit of $297 million driven by the impact of the recent U.S. federal tax law change and an income tax benefit of $19 million due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock-based compensation. Refer to Note 5 and Note 2 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the impact of the recent federal tax law change and adoption of the new accounting standard. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the provision for income taxes included an income tax benefit of $17 million driven primarily by a restructuring of the ownership of our Canadian business.

SOP 865 834 31 4

Net Sales. Net sales increased $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to higher pricing, a 2% increase in concentrate case sales and lower discounts primarily as a result of a favorable comparison of the annual true-up of our estimated customer incentive liability.
SOP. SOP increased $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by an increase in net sales which was partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily the result of a $13 million increase in marketing investments and higher people costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.

Volume (BCS). Volume (BCS) increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. Canada Dry and Schweppes had gains of 4% and 2%, respectively, due to continued growth in the ginger ale category for both brands and the sparkling water category for Canada Dry. These increases were partially offset by decreases in A&W and 7UP, which declined 2% and 1%, respectively, compared to the prior year. Our other brands declined 1% in total, primarily as a result of discontinuing the distribution of Country Time in 2016. Dr Pepper was flat compared to the prior year driven by increases in our fountain business fully offset by declines in TEN and diet.

Volume. Branded CSD volumes were flat for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. Canada Dry increased 5% due to continued growth in the ginger ale category. This increase was fully offset by a 2% decrease in 7UP, a 2% decline in A&W and a 2% decline in other CSD brands. Dr Pepper was flat as growth in regular was fully offset by declines in TEN and diet.
Branded NCB volumes increased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. Bai increased 99% driven by the acquired Bai Brands shipments to third parties since the Bai Brands Merger and continued growth in our existing distribution as a result of distribution gains and product innovation. Our growth allied brands gained 40% due primarily to distribution gains for BODYARMOR, Core and Fiji, and product innovation for BODYARMOR. Mott's increased 1% compared to the prior year as growth in our sauce products was partially offset by declines in juice. Clamato increased 3%. These increases were partially offset as Snapple declined 3% due to competitive headwinds, the de-emphasis on our value products, and lower promotional activity partially offset by the launch of our new PET packaging for our 16 oz. bottles and the Takes 2 to Mango flavor innovation. Other NCB brands were 5% lower, led by Rockstar, AriZona and Hawaiian Punch. The decline in Rockstar is due to the loss of distribution rights beginning in April 2017.
Contract manufacturing increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016.
Net Sales. Net sales increased $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. Net sales increased due to favorable product and package mix, as a result of our NCBs, including our allied brands, $64 million in acquired Bai Brands shipments to third parties since the Bai Brands Merger, and higher organic sales volumes. These increases were partially offset by the loss of the Rockstar distribution.
SOP. SOP decreased $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, as increases in SG&A expenses and cost of sales more than offset the increase in net sales.
Cost of sales increased as a primary result of higher costs associated with product and package mix, as a result of our NCBs, including our allied brands, and an increase in costs associated with the acquired Bai Brands shipments to third parties since the Bai Brands Merger and the initial $9 million profit in stock adjustment as a result of the Bai Brands Merger. Cost of sales was additionally impacted by the increase in other manufacturing costs and the unfavorable change in our LIFO inventory provision. These increases were partially offset by the incremental profit margin benefit we experienced as a result of becoming the brand owner for Bai Brands and ongoing productivity improvements.

SG&A expenses increased driven primarily by the Bai Brands Merger, which includes the acquired operating costs, primarily marketing and people costs, as well as transaction and integration expenses. SG&A expenses further increased due to higher people costs, driven by inflationary increases and additional frontline labor investment.

SOP 62 78 (16 ) (21 )

Volume. Sales volume increased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales volume was primarily driven by a 5% increase in Peñafiel as a result of distribution gains, increased promotional activity and product innovation, partially offset by increased competition. Squirt had a 2% gain due to increased sales to third party bottlers and product innovation. Clamato increased 2% due to product innovation, distribution gains and increased promotional activity. Our other brands increased approximately 3%, driven by Crush.
Net Sales. Net sales increased $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016. Net sales increased as a result of increased sales volume and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable package and product mix, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $3 million and higher discounts.
SOP. SOP decreased $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the year ended December 31, 2016, driven by increases in cost of sales and SG&A expenses, partially offset by an increase in net sales.
Cost of sales increased compared to the prior year as a result of higher commodity costs, led by packaging, increased costs associated with gains in sales volume, unfavorable foreign currency effects and the $6 million default by a supplier of resin to our operations in Mexico during the third quarter of 2017. These increases were partially offset by favorable package and product mix.
SG&A expenses increased compared to the prior year as a result of higher people costs, increased logistic costs driven by higher rates and gains in sales volumes, and increases in other operating costs. These drivers were partially offset by the favorable comparison to the $4 million arbitration award related to our former Mexican joint venture in the prior year and favorable foreign currency effects.
The impact of the net unfavorable foreign currency effects on costs of sales and SG&A expenses, totaled $8 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Information
We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, we believe that certain non-GAAP measures that reflect the way management evaluates the business may provide investors with additional information regarding our results, trends and ongoing performance on a comparable basis.
Core results is defined as reported results adjusted for the unrealized mark-to-market impact of commodity derivatives and interest rate derivatives not designated as hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP and certain items that are excluded for comparison to prior year periods. Management believes that core results provide a comparable basis to evaluate our results period over period, which is also used as the basis for incentive compensation for our employees.
The certain items excluded for the year ended December 31, 2017, are (i) the impact of transaction and integration expenses associated with the Bai Brands Merger and (ii) restructuring charges associated with a limited workforce reduction, which will primarily be paid during 2018.

Volume (BCS). Volume (BCS) increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. In the U.S. and Canada, volume was 1% higher, and in Mexico and the Caribbean, volume increased 5%, compared with the prior year. Both Branded CSD and NCB volume increased 1% compared to the prior year.
In branded CSDs, Squirt increased 6% primarily driven by increased sales to third-party bottlers and product innovation in our Latin America Beverages segment and our Hispanic strategy in the U.S. Schweppes grew 8% reflecting distribution gains in our sparkling water and growth in the ginger ale category. Dr Pepper had gains of 1% driven primarily by increases in our fountain business. Regular Dr Pepper increased compared to the prior year, which was partially offset by declines in diet. Peñafiel increased 3% in our Latin America Beverages segment as a result of distribution gains, increased promotional activity and product innovation, partially offset by increased competition. Crush grew 3% in the current year. These gains were partially offset by a 2% decline in our other CSD brands compared to the prior year. Canada Dry, 7UP, A&W and Sunkist soda (our "Core 4 brands") were flat compared to the prior year, driven by an 6% increase in Canada Dry fully offset by a 5% decline in 7UP, a 2% decrease in A&W and a 1% decline in Sunkist soda.
In branded NCBs, our water category increased 18% primarily due to incremental promotional activity behind Bai primarily in our club channel, distribution gains for Bai, Fiji and Core Hydration, and an increase in Aguafiel due to category growth in Mexico. Clamato increased 10% primarily due to increased promotional activity, distribution gains, and product innovation in our Latin America Beverages segment and increased promotional activity in the U.S.. These increases were partially offset by declines in Hawaiian Punch, Mott's and our other NCB brands in total. Hawaiian Punch declined 6% due to category headwinds and higher pricing for our single-serve packages while Mott's decreased 3% due to declines in the juice category and higher pricing for our single-serve packages, partially offset by gains in our sauce products. Our other NCB brands in total declined 8%. Snapple was flat compared to prior year.
Net Sales. Net sales increased $158 million, or approximately 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. The primary drivers of the increase in net sales included:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
• favorable product and package mix, which increased net sales by about 2.5%;

- ---------------------------------------------------------
• increase in shipments, which increased net sales by 1.0%;

- --------------------------------------------------
• higher pricing, which increased net sales by 1.0%;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• unfavorable foreign currency translation of $79 million, which decreased net sales by 1.0%; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------

Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $135 million, or approximately 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. Gross margin was 59.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the gross margin of 59.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following drivers impacted the gross margin:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• favorable comparison in our mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts, which increased our gross margin by 0.5%.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower commodity costs, led by packaging, and the change in our LIFO inventory provision, which increased our gross margin by 0.5%;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• increase in our net pricing, which increased our gross margin by 0.4%;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• ongoing productivity improvements, which increased our gross margin by 0.4%;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• unfavorable product, package and segment mix, which decreased our gross margin by 0.7%;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• unfavorable foreign currency effects, which decreased our gross margin by 0.3%; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• increase in our other manufacturing costs, which decreased our gross margin by 0.2%.

The favorable mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $21 million in unrealized gains versus $13 million in unrealized losses in the prior year.
SG&A Expenses. SG&A expenses increased $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher people costs, a $4 million arbitration award related to our Mexican joint venture, increased professional fees, a non-recurring charge of $4 million related to the transition of a certain employee benefit program and increases in other miscellaneous expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower logistics costs, driven by fuel rates, the impact of favorable foreign currency effects, which decreased SG&A expenses by $27 million, and a $23 million favorable comparison in the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $31 million in unrealized gains related to the mark-to-market activity on commodity derivative contracts versus $8 million in unrealized gains in the year ago period.
Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net. Other operating (income) expense, net had a favorable change of $10 million due primarily to the favorable comparison related to the brand value impairment of Garden Cocktail recognized in the prior year and a $7 million gain on the step-acquisition of Industria Embotelladora de Bebidas Mexicanas ("IEBM") and Embotelladora Mexicana de Agua, S.A. de C.V. ("EMA").
Income from Operations. Income from operations increased $135 million to $1,433 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to the increase in gross profit, the favorable change in other operating (income) expense, net and the decrease in depreciation and amortization, driven by certain fully depreciated fixed assets. These drivers were partially offset by the increase in SG&A expenses.
Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily driven by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $12 million of mark-to-market activity recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016 for four derivative instruments, as the hedging relationships between the four outstanding interest rate swaps and our 2.70% senior notes due November 15, 2022 were de-designated on October 1, 2016;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $5 million of amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the 364-day bridge loan facility (the "Bridge Facility");

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher average debt balance and higher average interest rates attributable to the issuance of our 3.40% senior notes due November 15, 2025 (the "2025 Notes") and 4.50% senior notes due November 15, 2045 (the "2045 Notes") during the fourth quarter of 2015; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the issuance of the senior unsecured notes during the fourth quarter of 2016 for the Bai Brands Merger.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In October 2016, we redeemed a portion of the 2018 Notes and retired, at a premium, an aggregate principal amount of approximately $360 million with the proceeds from the issuance of our 2.55% senior notes due on September 15, 2026 (the "2026 Notes"). The loss on early extinguishment of the 2018 Notes, which primarily represented the redemption premium, was approximately $31 million. There was no loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2015.
Other Income, Net. Other income, net increased $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the year ended December 31, 2015 driven primarily by a $21 million gain on the extinguishment of a multi-employer pension plan withdrawal liability.

Net Sales. Net sales increased $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to higher pricing, a 1% increase in concentrate case sales, favorable product mix and lower discounts. These drivers were partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The lower discounts were a result of a favorable comparison of the annual true-up of our estimated customer incentive liability partially offset by higher discounts driven by our fountain business.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Trends and Uncertainties Affecting Liquidity
Customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by various risk factors discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors", including recession or other economic downturn in the U.S., Mexico and the Caribbean or Canada, which could result in a reduction in our sales volume. Similarly, disruptions in financial and credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. These disruptions could have a negative impact on the ability of our customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, or the ability of our vendors to timely supply materials.
We believe that the following events, trends and uncertainties may also impact liquidity:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• upon consummation of the Transaction, we will incur substantial third party indebtedness;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• our ability to issue unsecured commercial paper notes ("Commercial Paper") on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million, which has been limited to $200 million subject to Keurig's approval upon execution of the Merger Agreement;

- -------------------------------
• continued payment of dividends;

- -------------------------------
• continued capital expenditures;

- ------------------------------------
• fluctuations in our tax obligations;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
• seasonality of our operating cash flows could impact short-term liquidity;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• our integration of Bai Brands following completion of the Bai Brands Merger;

- -----------------------------------------------
• future equity investments in allied brands; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• future mergers or acquisitions of regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage.

Financing Arrangements
Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for management's discussion of financing arrangements.

Liquidity
Based on our current and anticipated level of operations, without giving effect to the Transaction, we believe that our operating cash flows and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations for the next twelve months. To the extent that our operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary.
The following table summarizes our cash activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:

--------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ----- ---- ---- ---- --- ---- - - -----

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the impact of certain reconciling adjustments to net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by a unfavorable change in working capital.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to our $35 million multi-employer pension plan settlement payment.

• the proceeds from the net issuance of commercial paper of $66 million.

2016
Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of proceeds from our issuances of senior unsecured notes, partially offset by stock repurchases of $519 million and dividend payments of $386 million, the repayment at maturity of our 2.90% Notes due January 15, 2016 of $500 million, and our partial redemption of our 2018 Notes, which included $360 million for principal repayments and $31 million related to the redemption premium.
On September 16, 2016, we completed the issuance of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes.
On December 14, 2016, we issued an additional $1,550 million of senior unsecured notes consisting of $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.53% Senior Notes due November 15, 2021, 3.13% aggregate principal amount of our 3.13% Senior Notes due December 15, 2023, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Notes, and $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.42% Senior Notes due December 15, 2046.
2015
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consisted of stock repurchases of $521 million and dividend payments of $355 million, largely offset by proceeds from our issuance of senior unsecured notes.
On November 9, 2015, we completed the issuance of two tranches of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.40% Senior Notes due November 15, 2025 and $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 2045 Notes.

Debt Ratings
As of December 31, 2017, our debt ratings were as follows:

------------- ------------------------ ----------------------- ------- -------------------

Rating Agency Long-Term Debt Rating(1) Commercial Paper Rating Outlook Date of Last Change
Moody's Baa1 P-2 Stable May 18, 2011
S&P BBB+ A-2 Stable November 13, 2013

____________________________

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Subsequent to December 31, 2017, and as a result of the Transaction, Moody's and S&P have changed their outlook. Moody's has placed DPS ratings under review for downgrade and S&P has placed DPS as Creditwatch Negative.

These debt and commercial paper ratings impact the interest we pay on our financing arrangements. A downgrade of one or both of our debt and commercial paper ratings could increase our interest expense and decrease the cash available to fund anticipated obligations.

Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures were $202 million, $180 million, and $179 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily related to machinery and equipment, building and improvements, IT investments, replacement of existing cold drink equipment, and our distribution fleet.

Table of Contents

Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to machinery and equipment, our distribution fleet, and costs associated with a new manufacturing plant in Mexico.
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to machinery and equipment including production improvements in our Mexico facilities, distribution fleet and buildings and improvements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
As a result of the above items, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents decreased $1,629 million since December 31, 2016 to $158 million as of December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the Bai Brands Merger.
Our cash balances are used to fund working capital requirements, scheduled debt and interest payments, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. Cash generated by our foreign operations is generally repatriated to the U.S. periodically except when required to fund working capital requirements in those jurisdictions. Foreign cash balances were $46 million and $51 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We accrue tax costs for repatriation, as applicable, as cash is generated in those foreign jurisdictions.

Acquisitions and Investments
We have shown a disciplined approach to strategic investments in certain allied brands to enhance our position in premium and high growth categories and strengthen our existing distribution partnerships. On January 31, 2017, we completed the Bai Brands Merger. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Bai Brands Merger, other acquisitions and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries.
We may continue to make future equity investments in allied brands and/or acquisitions of regional bottling companies, distributors and/or distribution rights to further extend our geographic coverage. Any acquisitions may require additional funding for future capital expenditures and possibly restructuring expenses. Refer to Note 20 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our subsequent investment in Core.

Contractual Commitments and Obligations
We enter into various contractual obligations that impact, or could impact, our liquidity. Based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations. To the extent that our operating cash flows and cash on hand are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the senior unsecured notes payments described in this table.
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies as of December 31, 2017:

Amounts excluded from our table
As of December 31, 2017, we had $10 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, related interest and penalties classified as a long-term liability. The table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $17 million. This amount is impacted by, among other items, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets. We did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above.
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was enacted in August 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above.
Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our single employer plans discussed above.

We have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other non-current liabilities. We did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control. Refer to Note 2 and Note 6 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
In general, we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims. Our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs is estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. As of December 31, 2017, our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs totaled approximately $94 million. Refer to Note 2 and Note 14 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We did not include estimated payments related to our insurance liability in the table above.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We currently participate in three multi-employer pension plans. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan, and U.S. GAAP would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multi-employer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our multi-employer pension plans.
There are no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. These estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates. We have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets
For goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, we conduct tests for impairment annually, as of October 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment. If the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination and also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units. We define reporting units as Beverage Concentrates, Latin America Beverages, and Packaged Beverages' three reporting units, DSD, WD and Bai.The impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating a fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is recorded. The impairment tests for goodwill include comparing a fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill and considering any indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges ("Step 1"). If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, impairment is indicated and a second step ("Step 2") analysis must be performed. For our detailed impairment analysis, we used an income based approach to determine the fair value of our assets, as well as an overall consideration of market capitalization and our enterprise value. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. These assumptions could be negatively impacted by various risks discussed in "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Critical assumptions include revenue growth and profit performance, as well as an appropriate discount rate. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt, adjusted with various risk premiums. For 2017, such discount rates ranged from 5.00% to 8.00%. The carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2017, were $3,561 million and $3,781 million, respectively.As of October 1, 2017, we recorded a $1 million impairment charge for our Aguafiel brand, which was the value acquired in the step-acquisition of IEBM and EMA in 2016. As of October 1, 2015, we recorded a $7 million impairment charge for our Garden Cocktail brand. We have not identified any other impairments in goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets during 2017, 2016 or 2015.Holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant, including the revenue and profit performance assumption, the effect of a 0.50% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units as of October 1, 2017 would not change our conclusion, except for Bai. As of January 1, 2018, the Bai and WD reporting units were aggregated into one reporting unit for purposes of impairment testing. Refer to Note 20 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the change in our reporting units. As a result of this change, the Bai sensitivity was not provided as it will no longer be measured as a separate reporting unit.Holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant, including the revenue and profit performance assumption, the effect of a 0.50% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our brands as of October 1, 2017 would reduce the fair value of our brands but would not change our conclusion except for Bai. The result of this effect would impact the amount of headroom over the carrying value of our brands as follows (in millions):
 Fair Value Carrying Value
 Headroom Percentage Result +0.50% Result +0.50%
 Potential impairment $ — $ 990 $ — $ 1,073
 0 - 10% 1,122 — 1,073 —
 11 - 20% — — — —
 21 - 50% — 919 — 655
 51 - 100% 1,011 — 655 —
 >100% 16,508 14,943 1,971 1,971
 $ 18,641 $ 16,852 $ 3,699 $ 3,699

 Furthermore, during 2018, if actual results do not achieve the revenue and profit performance assumptions used in our impairment analysis as of October 1, 2017, the Bai brand could also become impaired.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue, net of the costs of our customer incentives, at the time risk of loss has been transferred to our customer. Accruals for customer incentives and marketing programs are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms, volume-based metrics and/or historical trends. Our customer incentives and marketing accrual methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate our customer participation and volume performance levels which impact the expense recognition. Our estimates are based primarily on a combination of known or historical transaction experiences. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized to earnings in the period differences are determined.Further judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a reduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense. A 10% change in the accrual for our customer incentives and marketing programs as of December 31, 2017, would have affected our net sales and SG&A expenses by $27 million and $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
Pension Benefits
We have several pension plans covering employees who satisfy age and length of service requirements. Depending on the plan, pension benefits are based on a combination of factors, which may include salary, age and years of service.Our largest U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which is a cash balance plan, was suspended and the accrued benefit was frozen effective December 31, 2008. Participants in this plan no longer earn additional benefits for future services or salary increases. Employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our Consolidated Financial Statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions, employee demographic data, years of service, compensation, benefits paid and employer contributions. The calculation of pension plan obligations and related expenses is dependent on several assumptions used to estimate the present value of the benefits earned while the employee is eligible to participate in the plans. The key assumptions we use in the actuarial methods to determine the plan obligations and related expenses include: (1) the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities; (2) retirement age and mortality; and (3) the expected return on plan assets. Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the key assumptions. The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the pension benefit obligations for U.S. plans would change the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 by approximately a $25 million decrease and a $31 million increase, respectively. The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $2 million decrease and a $3 million increase, respectively. The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $2 million.

Risk Management Programs
We retain selected levels of property, casualty, workers' compensation, health and other business risks. Many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or self-insured retentions. We believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our self-insured liabilities. However, the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known. Accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty and health risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors, which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends. These loss development factors are established in consultation with actuaries. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self-insured liabilities as compared to prior periods. The final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents, medical cost inflation, legislative actions, uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control.A 10% change in our accrued liabilities related to the retained risks, net of associated receivables, as of December 31, 2017 would have affected income from operations by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Income Taxes
We establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained, (2) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained , but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.We assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions.We base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings, our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. As these audits progress, events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions.To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.If results differ from our assumptions, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
Business Combinations
We record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. All of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, as discussed in the Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets critical accounting estimate section.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

As of December 31, 2017, we are authorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2017, we have not declared any dividends and our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted. As of December 31, 2017, there were 2,397 million shares and 509 million shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, issued and outstanding. Abandonment of the Reclassification In September 2017, our board of directors decided to abandon the proposal to create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock) and the intention to issue a dividend of two shares of Class C capital stock for each outstanding share of Class A and Class B common stock (the Reclassification). As a result, we will not proceed with the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which was approved by our stockholders on June 20, 2016. 77 Share Repurchase Program In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a $6.0 b...

Contractual Commitments and Obligations
We enter into various contractual obligations that impact, or could impact, our liquidity. Based on our current and anticipated level of operations, we believe that our proceeds from operating cash flows and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our anticipated obligations. To the extent that our operating cash flows and cash on hand are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, we may utilize amounts available under our financing arrangements, if necessary. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the senior unsecured notes payments described in this table.
The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and contingencies as of December 31, 2017:

(7) Amounts represent our estimated interest payments based on specified interest rates for fixed rate debt and the impact of interest rate swaps that effectively convert fixed interest rates to variable interest rates. Amounts exclude any gain or loss upon settlement of related interest rate swaps. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Amounts excluded from our table
As of December 31, 2017, we had $10 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, related interest and penalties classified as a long-term liability. The table above does not reflect any payments related to these amounts as it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or timing of the payment. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
The total accrued benefit liability representing the underfunded position for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $17 million. This amount is impacted by, among other items, funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan assumptions and the investment return on plan assets. We did not include estimated payments related to our total accrued benefit liability in the table above.
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was enacted in August 2006 and established, among other things, new standards for funding of U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities. Our international pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations. We did not include our estimated contributions to our various single employer plans in the table above.
Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our single employer plans discussed above.

We have a deferred compensation plan where the assets are maintained in a rabbi trust and the corresponding liability related to the plan is recorded in other non-current liabilities. We did not include estimated payments related to the deferred compensation liability as the timing and payment of these amounts are determined by the participants and outside our control. Refer to Note 2 and Note 6 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
In general, we are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims. Our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs is estimated through actuarial procedures of the insurance industry and by using industry assumptions, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claim history. As of December 31, 2017, our accrued liabilities for our losses related to these programs totaled approximately $94 million. Refer to Note 2 and Note 14 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We did not include estimated payments related to our insurance liability in the table above.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
We currently participate in three multi-employer pension plans. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, the plan will ultimately assess us a withdrawal liability for exiting the plan, and U.S. GAAP would require us to record the withdrawal charge as an expense in our consolidated statements of income and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets once the multi-employer pension withdrawal charge is probable and estimable. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our multi-employer pension plans.
There are no other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources other than letters of credit outstanding. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding outstanding letters of credit.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are both fundamental to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results and require difficult, subjective or complex estimates and assessments. These estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant estimates and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised when necessary. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess or measure our critical accounting estimates. We have identified the items described below as our critical accounting estimates. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use in our critical accounting estimates. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these and other accounting policies.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets
For goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, we conduct tests for impairment annually, as of October 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We use present value and other valuation techniques to make this assessment. If the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For purposes of impairment testing we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination and also assign indefinite lived intangible assets to our reporting units. We define reporting units as Beverage Concentrates, Latin America Beverages, and Packaged Beverages']:

Holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends.

[' compensation, health and other business risks. Many of these risks are covered under conventional insurance programs with high deductibles or self-insured retentions. We believe the use of actuarial methods to estimate our future losses provides a consistent and effective way to measure our self-insured liabilities. However, the estimation of our liability is judgmental and uncertain given the nature of claims involved and length of time until their ultimate cost is known. Accrued liabilities related to the retained casualty and health risks are calculated based on loss experience and development factors, which contemplate a number of variables including claim history and expected trends. These loss development factors are established in consultation with actuaries. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self-insured liabilities as compared to prior periods. The final settlement amount of claims can differ materially from our estimate as a result of changes in factors such as the frequency and severity of accidents, medical cost inflation, legislative actions, uncertainty around jury verdicts and awards and other factors outside of our control.A 10% change in our accrued liabilities related to the retained risks, net of associated receivables, as of December 31, 2017 would have affected income from operations by approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Income Taxes
We establish income tax liabilities to remove some or all of the income tax benefit of any of our income tax positions based upon one of the following: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained, (2) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount, or (3) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained , but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken.We assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Our liability for uncertain tax positions contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions.We base our judgment of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset primarily on historical earnings, our estimate of current and expected future earnings and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. As these audits progress, events may occur that cause us to change our liability for uncertain tax positions.To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for uncertain tax positions has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.If results differ from our assumptions, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets may be increased or decreased which would impact our effective tax rate.

Business Combinations
We record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. All of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Significant assumptions and estimates include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital, and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, if applicable. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, as discussed in the Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets critical accounting estimate section.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 18

[" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Critical assumptions include revenue growth and profit performance, as well as an appropriate discount rate. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of equity and cost of debt, adjusted with various risk premiums. For 2017, such discount rates ranged from 5.00% to 8.00%. The carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2017, were $3,561 million and $3,781 million, respectively.As of October 1, 2017, we recorded a $1 million impairment charge for our Aguafiel brand, which was the value acquired in the step-acquisition of IEBM and EMA in 2016. As of October 1, 2015, we recorded a $7 million impairment charge for our Garden Cocktail brand. We have not identified any other impairments in goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets during 2017, 2016 or 2015.Holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant, including the revenue and profit performance assumption, the effect of a 0.50% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units as of October 1, 2017 would not change our conclusion, except for Bai. As of January 1, 2018, the Bai and WD reporting units were aggregated into one reporting unit for purposes of impairment testing. Refer to Note 20 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the change in our reporting units. As a result of this change, the Bai sensitivity was not provided as it will no longer be measured as a separate reporting unit.Holding all other assumptions in the analysis constant, including the revenue and profit performance assumption, the effect of a 0.50% increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our brands as of October 1, 2017 would reduce the fair value of our brands but would not change our conclusion except for Bai. The result of this effect would impact the amount of headroom over the carrying value of our brands as follows (in millions):
 Fair Value Carrying Value
 Headroom Percentage Result +0.50% Result +0.50%
 Potential impairment $ — $ 990 $ — $ 1,073
 0 - 10% 1,122 — 1,073 —
 11 - 20% — — — —
 21 - 50% — 919 — 655
 51 - 100% 1,011 — 655 —
 >100% 16,508 14,943 1,971 1,971
 $ 18,641 $ 16,852 $ 3,699 $ 3,699

 Furthermore, during 2018, if actual results do not achieve the revenue and profit performance assumptions used in our impairment analysis as of October 1, 2017, the Bai brand could also become impaired.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue, net of the costs of our customer incentives, at the time risk of loss has been transferred to our customer. Accruals for customer incentives and marketing programs are established for the expected payout based on contractual terms, volume-based metrics and/or historical trends. Our customer incentives and marketing accrual methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate our customer participation and volume performance levels which impact the expense recognition. Our estimates are based primarily on a combination of known or historical transaction experiences. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized to earnings in the period differences are determined.Further judgment is required to ensure the classification of the spend is correctly recorded as either a reduction from gross sales or advertising and marketing expense. A 10% change in the accrual for our customer incentives and marketing programs as of December 31, 2017, would have affected our net sales and SG&A expenses by $27 million and $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Pension Benefits
We have several pension plans covering employees who satisfy age and length of service requirements. Depending on the plan, pension benefits are based on a combination of factors, which may include salary, age and years of service.Our largest U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which is a cash balance plan, was suspended and the accrued benefit was frozen effective December 31, 2008. Participants in this plan no longer earn additional benefits for future services or salary increases. Employee benefit plan obligations and expenses included in our Consolidated Financial Statements are determined from actuarial analyses based on plan assumptions, employee demographic data, years of service, compensation, benefits paid and employer contributions. The calculation of pension plan obligations and related expenses is dependent on several assumptions used to estimate the present value of the benefits earned while the employee is eligible to participate in the plans. The key assumptions we use in the actuarial methods to determine the plan obligations and related expenses include: (1) the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the plan liabilities; (2) retirement age and mortality; and (3) the expected return on plan assets. Our assumptions reflect our historical experience and our best judgment regarding future performance. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the key assumptions. The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the pension benefit obligations for U.S. plans would change the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2017 by approximately a $25 million decrease and a $31 million increase, respectively. The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the weighted-average discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $2 million decrease and a $3 million increase, respectively. The effect of a 1% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic pension costs would change the costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $2 million.
