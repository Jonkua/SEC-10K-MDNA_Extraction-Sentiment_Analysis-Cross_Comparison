Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Certain information contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward-looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Company’s future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as “estimate”, “forecast”, “project”, “plan”, “intend”, “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes to or new interpretations of U.S. or international tax regulations; the global financial and economic situation; changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the Company’s ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Company’s services, on the Company’s ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients’ premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; the Company’s ability to comply with governmental regulations affecting personnel services businesses in particular or employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; the Company’s reliance on short-term contracts for a significant percentage of its business; litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings; the ability of the Company to manage its international operations and comply with foreign laws and regulations; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the possibility that the additional costs the Company will incur as a result of health care reform legislation may adversely affect the Company’s profit margins or the demand for the Company’s services; the possibility that the Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems could be damaged or their service interrupted; and the possibility that the Company may fail to maintain adequate financial and management controls and as a result suffer errors in its financial reporting. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Executive Overview

 Demand for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor trends both domestically and abroad. Correspondingly, financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017, were positively impacted by improving global economic conditions as the year progressed. Annual net service revenues reached $5.27 billion in 2017, a slight increase from the prior year. Full-year 2017 net income decreased 15% to $291 million and diluted net income per share decreased 13% to $2.33. Included in 2017 net income was a one-time, non-cash charge to the Company's provision for income taxes of $34 million, or $.27 per share, resulting from the recently enacted TCJA. For 2017, revenue growth for temporary and consultant staffing was essentially flat compared to last year while permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services increased 5% and 2%, respectively.
We believe that the Company is well positioned in the current macroeconomic environment. The United States economic backdrop during 2017 was stable for the Company as real gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew 2.3%, while the unemployment rate declined from 4.7% in December 2016 to 4.1% in December 2017. In the United States, the number of job openings has exceeded the number of hires since February 2015, creating competition for skilled talent that increases the Company’s value to clients. The U.S. labor market continues to tighten, resulting in talent shortages in some occupations and higher demand for our services. The secular demand for temporary staffing is also ongoing. The number of temporary workers as a percentage of the overall U.S. workforce remains near an all-time high, a sign employers are building flexible staffing options into their human resource plans with increasing frequency.

Protiviti continues to see solid growth in its risk and compliance and internal audit and financial advisory practice areas. Protiviti also is expanding its solutions in areas such as data and analytics, and cybersecurity.
We monitor various economic indicators and business trends in all of the countries in which we operate to anticipate demand for the Company’s services. We evaluate these trends to determine the appropriate level of investment, including personnel, which will best position the Company for success in the current and future global macroeconomic environment. The Company’s investments in headcount are typically structured to proactively support and align with expected revenue growth trends. As such, during 2017, we added headcount in our temporary and consultant and permanent placement staffing services, while risk consulting and internal audit headcount remained essentially flat.
We have limited visibility into future revenues not only due to the dependence on macroeconomic conditions noted above, but also because of the relatively short duration of the Company’s client engagements. Accordingly, we typically assess headcount and other investments on at least a quarterly basis. That said, based on current trends and conditions, we expect headcount levels for our full-time staff to be modestly higher for each of our reporting segments throughout the first quarter of 2018.
Capital expenditures in 2017 totaled $41 million, approximately 46% of which represented investments in software initiatives and technology infrastructure, both of which are important to the Company’s future growth opportunities. While upgrades to enterprise resource planning and project management applications were completed in 2017, we continue to invest in digital technology initiatives designed to enhance our service offerings to both clients and candidates. Capital expenditures also included amounts spent on tenant improvements and furniture and equipment in the Company’s leased offices. We currently expect that 2018 capital expenditures will range from $45 million to $55 million.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
As described below, the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments.
Accounts Receivable Allowances.    The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from (i) the inability of its customers to make required payments, (ii) temporary placement sales adjustments, and (iii) permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90-day guarantee period, commonly referred to as “fall offs”. The Company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers’ credit profiles, historical loss statistics and current trends. The adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period. Historically, the Company’s actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances. As a percentage of gross accounts receivable, the Company’s accounts receivable allowances totaled 4.3% and 4.5% as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, a five-percentage point deviation in the Company’s accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of $1.7 million. Although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required.
Income Tax Assets and Liabilities.    In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Company’s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions.

On December 22, 2017, the President signed TCJA into law. Effective January 1, 2018, among other changes, TCJA reduces the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, provides for a deemed repatriation and taxation at reduced rates of certain foreign earnings (a “transition tax”), and establishes new mechanisms to tax certain foreign earnings going forward.  Similar to other large multinational companies, TCJA has wide ranging implications for the Company.  The Company has recorded provisional amounts and a reasonable estimate of TCJA’s impact on its financial statements.  As guidance regarding implementation of various provisions of TCJA is released by the U.S. Government over the course of 2018, the Company’s estimates may need to be adjusted accordingly.

In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“SAB 118”), which allows the Company to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to

14

extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Since TCJA was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretations are expected over the next 12 months, the Company considers the accounting of the transition tax, deferred tax remeasurements, and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and ongoing analysis of its final tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company expects to complete its analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118.
The Company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. When appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. Valuation allowances of $20.2 million and $18.9 million were recorded as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The valuation allowances recorded relate primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations. If such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income, the Company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the related valuation reserve.
While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the Company.
Goodwill Impairment.    The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) authoritative guidance. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of June 30, 2017, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. There were no events or changes in circumstances since the annual goodwill impairment assessment that caused the Company to perform an interim impairment assessment.
The Company follows FASB authoritative guidance utilizing a two-step approach for determining goodwill impairment. In the first step the Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a present value technique derived from a discounted cash flow methodology. For purposes of this assessment the Company’s reporting units are its lines of business. The fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. The second step under the FASB guidance is contingent upon the results of the first step. To the extent a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired and the Company must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment. The second step involves allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to its net assets in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill as of the assessment date. The implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date.
The Company’s reporting units are Accountemps, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology, Robert Half Management Resources and Protiviti, which had goodwill balances at December 31, 2017, of $127.5 million, $26.2 million, $0.0 million, $7.0 million, $0.0 million and $50.2 million, respectively, totaling $210.9 million. There were no changes to the Company’s reporting units or to the allocations of goodwill by reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance. The discount rate for all reporting units was determined by management based on estimates of risk free interest rates, beta and market risk premiums. The discount rate used was compared to the rate published in various third party research reports, which indicated that the rate was within a range of reasonableness. The primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and profitability levels. In addition, the impairment assessment requires that management make certain judgments in allocating shared assets and liabilities to the balance sheets of the reporting units. Solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to its annual goodwill impairment testing, the Company made the following assumptions. The Company assumed that year-to-date trends through the date of the most recent assessment would continue for all reporting units through 2017, using unique assumptions for each reporting unit. In addition, the Company applied profitability assumptions consistent with each reporting unit’s historical trends at various revenue levels and, for years 2019 and beyond, used a 3.5% growth factor. This rate is comparable to the Company’s most recent ten-year annual compound revenue growth rate. The model used to calculate fair value extends a total of 10 years with a terminal value calculation at the end of the 10 year period. In its most recent calculation, the Company used a 10.3% discount rate, which is slightly higher than the 9.8% discount rate used for the Company’s test during the second quarter of 2016. This increase in discount rate is attributable to increases in the risk free rate and the equity market risk premium, offset by a slight decrease in beta.

15

In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied hypothetical decreases to the fair values of each reporting unit. The Company determined that hypothetical decreases in fair value of at least 62% would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value.
Given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the Company’s business, there can be no assurance that the Company’s estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the Company’s goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If the Company’s assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or profitability growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved, the Company may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.
Workers’ Compensation.    Except for states which require participation in state-operated insurance funds, the Company retains the economic burden for the first $0.5 million per occurrence in workers’ compensation claims. Workers’ compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Claims in excess of $0.5 million are insured. Workers’ compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of $0.5 million, claims administration fees charged by the Company’s workers’ compensation administrator, premiums paid to state-operated insurance funds, and an estimate for the Company’s liability for Incurred But Not Reported (“IBNR”) claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims. Total workers’ compensation expense was $6.2 million, $0.9 million and $4.6 million, representing 0.15%, 0.02% and 0.11% of applicable U.S. revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The reserves for IBNR claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period include estimates. The Company has established reserves for workers’ compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the Company’s historical frequency and severity of workers’ compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Company’s future results. Based on the Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2017, a five-percentage point deviation in the Company’s estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the reserve of $0.2 million.
Stock-based Compensation.    Under various stock plans, officers, employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock.
The Company recognizes compensation expense equal to the grant-date fair value for all stock-based payment awards that are expected to vest. This expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award, unless the awards are subject to performance conditions, in which case the Company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche. The Company determines the grant-date fair value of its restricted stock and stock unit awards using the fair market value of its stock on the grant date, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case the Company utilizes a binomial-lattice model (i.e., Monte Carlo simulation model). The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to determine the stock-based compensation expense.
No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the Company’s existing stock plans. The Company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was $42.2 million, $42.7 million and $41.3 million, respectively, of which $11.4 million, $11.0 million and $11.1 million was related to grants made in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Based on the Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2017, a one-percentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a $0.4 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Results of Operations
Demand for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad. Correspondingly, results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, were positively impacted by improving global economic conditions as the year progressed. Because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends and the absence of

16

material long-term contracts in any of the Company’s business units, future demand for the Company’s services cannot be forecasted with certainty. We believe the Company is well positioned in the current United States macroeconomic environment.
The Company’s temporary and permanent staffing business has 323 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries, while Protiviti has 56 offices in 23 states and 11 foreign countries.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The financial results of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and the rules of the SEC. To help readers understand the Company’s financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with revenue growth rates derived from non-GAAP revenue amounts.
Variations in the Company’s financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and billing days. The Company provides “same billing days and constant currency” revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company’s reportable segments on both a reported basis and also on a same day, constant-currency basis for global, U.S. and international operations. The Company has provided this data because management believes it better reflects the Company’s actual revenue growth rates and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates.
In order to calculate constant currency revenue growth rates, as reported amounts are retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior year’s comparable period. Management then calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all lines of business. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the Company calculates same billing day revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period’s reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period, to arrive at a per billing day amount. Same billing day growth rates are then calculated based upon the per billing day amounts. The term “same billing days and constant currency” means that the impact of different billing days has been removed from the constant currency calculation.
The non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company’s industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the same-day, constant-currency revenue growth rates to the reported revenue growth rates is provided herein.
Refer to Item 7a. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
Years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016
Revenues.    The Company’s revenues were $5.27 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing by 0.3% compared to $5.25 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenues from foreign operations represented 22% and 20% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services. In 2017, revenues for permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services were up and revenues for temporary and consultant staffing were down slightly compared to 2016. Revenue growth was strongest internationally, most notably within Europe. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.
Temporary and consultant staffing revenues were $4.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, remained essentially flat compared to revenues of $4.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Key drivers of temporary and consultant staffing revenues include average hourly bill rates and the number of hours worked by the Company’s temporary employees on client engagements. On a same-day, constant-currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing revenues decreased 0.3% for 2017, compared to 2016, due primarily to fewer hours worked by the Company’s temporary employees, partially offset by a 2.7% increase in average bill rates. In the U.S., 2017 revenues decreased 3.1% on an as reported basis and 2.8% on a same-day basis, compared to 2016. For the Company’s international operations, 2017 revenues increased 11.0% on an as reported basis and 10.1% on a same-day, constant-currency basis, compared to 2016.

17

Permanent placement staffing revenues were $439 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing by 4.7% compared to revenues of $419 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Key drivers of permanent placement staffing revenues consist of the number of candidate placements and average fees earned per placement. On a same-day, constant-currency basis, permanent placement staffing revenues increased 4.9% for 2017 compared to 2016 due to increases in both the number of placements and average fees per placement. In the U.S., 2017 revenues increased 0.9% on an as reported basis and 1.3% on a same-day basis, compared to 2016. For the Company’s international operations, 2017 revenues increased 14.1% on an as reported basis, and on a same-day, constant-currency basis increased 13.5%, compared to 2016. Historically, demand for permanent placement services is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for temporary and consulting staffing and this is expected to continue.
Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $817 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, increasing by 1.5% compared to revenues of $804 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Key drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services revenues are the billable hours worked by consultants on client engagements and average hourly bill rates. On a same-day, constant-currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues increased 1.9% for 2017 compared to 2016, driven primarily by increases in billable hours and billing rates. In the U.S., 2017 revenues remained essentially flat on an as reported basis, and increased 0.3% on a same-day basis, compared to 2016. For the Company’s international operations, 2017 revenues increased 9.5% on an as reported basis, or 10.2% on a same-day, constant-currency basis, compared to 2016.
A reconciliation of the non-GAAP year-over-year revenue growth rates to the as reported year-over-year revenue growth rates for the year ended December 31, 2017, is presented in the following table:

------------------------------------------- ------ ---- ------------- ------------- ---- - ---- -

Gross Margin.    The Company’s gross margin dollars were $2.16 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.
Gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary employees, and reimbursable expenses. The key drivers of gross margin are: i) pay/bill spreads, which represent the differential between wages paid to temporary employees and amounts billed to clients; ii) fringe costs, which are primarily composed of payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary and consultant staffing employees; and iii) conversion revenues, which are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position with the Company’s client. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were $1.49 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, down 1.1% from $1.51 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing were 37.2% in 2017, down from 37.5% in 2016. This year-over-year decline in gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to higher workers’ compensation costs and other fringe benefit costs. The Company’s 2017 results include $0.9 million in workers’ compensation credits, pursuant to third-party actuarial reviews of the Company’s workers’ compensation accruals. This compares to a credit of $5.8 million in the year-ago period.

18

Gross margin dollars for permanent placement staffing represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s permanent placement staffing division were $438 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, up 4.7% from $419 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing services are de minimis, the increase in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the increase in revenues previously discussed.
Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, benefit costs and reimbursable expenses. The primary drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin are: i) the relative composition of and number of professional staff and their respective pay and bill rates; and ii) staff utilization, which is the relationship of time spent on client engagements in proportion to the total time available for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit services staff. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit division were $232 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, up 0.2% from $231 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services were 28.4% in 2017, down from 28.7% in 2016. The decline in 2017 gross margin percentage compared to 2016 was primarily due to slightly lower staff utilization rates.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.65 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, up 2.5% from $1.61 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, the Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses were 31.3% for 2017, up from 30.6% for 2016. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were $1.14 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, up 1.9% from $1.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for temporary and consultant staffing were 28.4% in 2017, up from 27.7% in 2016. For 2017 compared to 2016, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to increases in staff compensation costs and costs expensed related to digital technology initiatives.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company’s permanent placement staffing division were $361 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, up 6.5% from $339 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement staffing services were 82.1% in 2017, up from 80.7% in 2016. For 2017 compared to 2016, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to increases in staff compensation costs and costs expensed related to digital technology initiatives.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division were $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, down 1.7% from $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for risk consulting and internal audit services were 18.1% in 2017, down from 18.7% in 2016. For 2017 compared to 2016, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to decreases in fixed overhead costs.
Operating Income.    The Company’s total operating income was $517 million, or 9.8% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017, down 6.7% from $555 million, or 10.6% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division, operating income was $356 million, or 8.9% of applicable revenues, down 9.7% from $394 million, or 9.8% of applicable revenues, in 2016. For the Company’s permanent placement staffing division, operating income was $77 million, or 17.7% of applicable revenues, down 2.9% from operating income of $80 million, or 19.1% of applicable revenues, in 2016. For the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division, operating income was $84 million, or 10.3% of applicable revenues, up 3.9% from operating income of $81 million, or 10% of applicable revenues, in 2016.
Provision for income taxes.    The provision for income taxes was 43.9% and 38.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the $34 million one-time, non-cash charge resulting from the recently enacted TCJA.

Years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015
Revenues.    The Company’s revenues were $5.25 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, increasing by 3.1% compared to $5.09 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenues from foreign operations represented 20% and 19% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services. In 2016, revenues for temporary and consultant staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services were up and revenue for permanent placement staffing was down compared to 2015. Revenue growth was strongest internationally, most notably within Europe. Risk consulting and internal audit services continued to post strong growth rates. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.
Temporary and consultant staffing revenues were $4.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, increasing by 2.4% compared to revenues of $3.93 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Key drivers of temporary and consultant staffing revenues include average hourly bill rates and the number of hours worked by the Company’s temporary employees on client engagements. On a same-day, constant-currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing revenues increased 2.8% for 2016, compared to 2015, due primarily to a 4.2% increase in average bill rates, partially offset by fewer hours worked by the Company's temporary employees. In the U.S., 2016 revenues increased 2.0% on an as reported basis and 1.9% on a same-day basis, compared to 2015. For the Company’s international operations, 2016 revenues increased 4.2% on an as reported basis and 6.9% on a same-day, constant-currency basis, compared to 2015.
Permanent placement staffing revenues were $419 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, decreasing by 0.5% compared to revenues of $421 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Key drivers of permanent placement staffing revenues consist of the number of candidate placements and average fees earned per placement. On a same-day, constant- currency basis, permanent placement revenues increased 0.3% for 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in as reported revenue was driven primarily by a decrease in number of placements, partially offset by an increase in average fees earned per placement. In the U.S., 2016 revenues increased 0.3% on an as reported basis and 0.1% on a same-day basis, compared to 2015. For the Company’s international operations, 2016 revenues decreased 2.3% on an as reported basis, and on a same-day, constant-currency basis increased 0.6%, compared to 2015. Historically, demand for permanent placement services is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for temporary and consulting staffing and this is expected to continue.
Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $804 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increasing by 8.3% compared to revenues of $743 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Key drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services revenues are the billable hours worked by consultants on client engagements and average hourly bill rates. On a same-day, constant-currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues increased 8.5% for 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to an increase in number of hours worked, partially offset by a decrease in average hourly bill rates. In the U.S., 2016 revenues increased 8.0% on an as reported basis, or 7.9% on a same-day basis, compared to 2015. For the Company’s international operations, 2016 revenues increased 9.6% on an as reported basis and 11.7% on a same-day, constant-currency basis, compared to 2015.

Gross Margin.    The Company’s gross margin dollars were $2.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, up 2.2% from $2.11 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.
Gross margin dollars from the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary employees, and reimbursable expenses. The key drivers of gross margin are: i) pay/bill spreads, which represent the differential between wages paid to temporary employees and amounts billed to clients; ii) fringe costs, which are primarily composed of payroll taxes and benefit costs for temporary and consultant staffing employees; and iii) conversion revenues, which are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position with the Company’s client. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were $1.51 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, up 3.2% from $1.46 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing were 37.5% in 2016, up from 37.2% in 2015. This year-over-year improvement in gross margin percentage of 0.3% was primarily attributable to higher pay/bill spreads and lower payroll taxes and workers’ compensation costs, partially offset by lower conversion revenues as a percentage of applicable revenue in 2016 compared to 2015.
Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s permanent placement staffing division were $419 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, down 0.5% from $421 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing services are de minimis, the decrease in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the decrease in revenues previously discussed.
Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, benefit costs and reimbursable expenses. The primary drivers of risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin are: i) the relative composition of and number of professional staff and their respective pay and bill rates; and ii) staff utilization, which is the relationship of time spent on client engagements in proportion to the total time available for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit services staff. Gross margin dollars for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit division were $231 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, up 0.4% from $230 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services were 28.7% in 2016, down from 31.0% in 2015. The decline in 2016 gross margin percentage compared to 2015 was due to lower staff utilization rates and the mix impact of lower financial services and regulatory compliance revenues, which is typically a higher margin business for the Company.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    The Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The Company’s selling, general and

21

administrative expenses were $1.61 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, up 4.7% from $1.53 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, the Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses were 30.6% for 2016, up from 30.1% for 2015. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division were $1.12 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, up 5.0% from $1.06 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for temporary and consultant staffing were 27.7% in 2016, up from 27.1% in 2015. For 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to increases in staff compensation costs, inclusive of employee medical costs, and variable overhead, including costs related to the Company’s new CRM and project management systems.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company’s permanent placement staffing division were $339 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, up 0.8% from $336 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement staffing services were 80.7% in 2016, up from 79.7% in 2015. For 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to increases in staff compensation costs, inclusive of employee medical costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division were$150 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, up 11.9% from $134 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for risk consulting and internal audit services were 18.7% in 2016, up from 18.1% in 2015. For 2016 compared to 2015, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to an increase in administrative compensation and fixed overhead.
Operating Income.    The Company’s total operating income was $555 million, or 10.6% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016, down 4.5% from $581 million, or 11.4% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the Company’s temporary and consultant staffing division, operating income was $394 million, or 9.8% of applicable revenues, down 1.5% from $400 million, or 10.2% of applicable revenues, in 2015. For the Company’s permanent placement staffing division, operating income was $80 million, or 19.1% of applicable revenues, down 5.9% from operating income of $85 million, or 20.2% of applicable revenues, in 2015. For the Company’s risk consulting and internal audit services division, operating income was $81 million, or 10.0% of applicable revenues, down 15.7% from operating income of $96 million, or 12.9% of applicable revenues, in 2015.
Provision for income taxes.    The provision for income taxes was 38.0% and 38.4% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease is primarily due to an increase of federal and state credits in the U.S, and benefit of foreign losses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The change in the Company’s liquidity during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends, and payments to trusts for employee deferred compensation plans.

[Refer to Item 7a]:
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Because a portion of the Company's net revenues are derived from its operations outside the U.S. and are denominated in local currencies, the Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company's exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Company's reported revenues, expenses, earnings, assets and liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 22% of the Company's revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations transact business in their functional currency, which is the same as their local currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly the Canadian dollar, British pound, Euro, and Australian dollar have an impact on the Company's reported results. Under GAAP, revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Company's non-U.S. markets, the Company's reported results vary. During 2017, the U.S. dollar fluctuated, but generally weakened, against the primary currencies in which the Company conducts business. Currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing reported net service revenues by $11 million, or 0.2%, in 2017 compared to prior year. The general weakening of the U.S. dollar also affected the reported level of expenses incurred in the Company's foreign operations. Because substantially all of the Company's foreign operations generated revenues and incurred expenses within the same country and currency, the unfavorable effect of higher reported operating expenses largely offset the increase in reported revenues. Reported net income was $0.8 million, or 0.2%, higher ...
