Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, and the discussion of risks and cautionary factors that may affect future results in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Description of Our Company

We are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the United States of America. We are building our future on smoke-free products that are a much better consumer choice than continuing to smoke cigarettes.  Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. Our vision is that these products ultimately replace cigarettes to the benefit of adult smokers, society, our company and our shareholders.

Our cigarettes are sold in more than 180 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands. In addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products ("RRPs"). RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.  We have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.  Because our RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.

For all periods presented in this report, we managed our business in four segments:

- ---------------
• European Union;

- ----------------------------------------------
• Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa (“EEMA”);

- ---------
• Asia; and

- -----------------------
• Latin America & Canada.

To provide a greater focus on both parts of our business -- combustible and reduced-risk products -- and to support our transformation toward a smoke-free future, effective January 1, 2018, we are managing our business in six reportable segments as follows:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• European Union - Covers all the European Union countries and also Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, which are linked to the European Union through trade agreements;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Eastern Europe - Includes Southeast Europe, Central Asia, Ukraine, Israel and Russia;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Middle East & Africa - Covers the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey and PMI Duty Free;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• South & Southeast Asia - Includes Indonesia, the Philippines and other markets in this region;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• East Asia & Australia - Includes Australia, Japan, South Korea, the People's Republic of China and other markets in this region, as well as Malaysia and Singapore; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Latin America & Canada - Covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada.

We use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, net of sales and promotion incentives. Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell. Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix). Mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix). We often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to governments, and, in those circumstances, we include the excise taxes in our net revenues and in excise taxes on products. Our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs, as well as the cost of the IQOS devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers.

Our marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most

 16

significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.

Philip Morris International Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions with respect to their common stock.

Executive Summary

The following executive summary provides significant highlights from the Discussion and Analysis that follows.

Consolidated Operating Results

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net Revenues and Net Revenues, Excluding Excise Taxes on Products – The changes in our net revenues, and net revenues, excluding excise taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable 2016 amounts, were as follows:

------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------- ------ -------- - --------------- ------ -------- ---------- ------- ----- - ----- - ------ - - ----- - - -----

 For the Years Ended December 31, Variance Variance due to
(in millions) 2017 2016 $ % Currency Volume/Mix Pricing
Net revenues $ 78,098 $ 74,953 $ 3,145 4.2 % $ (2,355 ) $ (439 ) $ 5,939
Excise taxes on products (49,350 ) (48,268 ) (1,082 ) (2.2 )% 1,918 1,553 (4,553 )
Net revenues, excluding excise taxes on products $ 28,748 $ 26,685 $ 2,063 7.7 % $ (437 ) $ 1,114 $ 1,386

Net revenues include $3.8 billion in 2017 and $739 million in 2016 related to the sale of RRPs, mainly driven by Japan. These net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers, where we collect and remit the excise tax. Excluding excise taxes, net revenues for RRPs were $3.6 billion in 2017 and $733 million in 2016. In some jurisdictions, including Japan, we are not responsible for collecting excise taxes.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Diluted Earnings Per Share – The changes in our reported diluted earnings per share (“diluted EPS”) for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable 2016 amounts, were as follows:

------------------------------------ ----------- -------- ----- --

 Diluted EPS % Growth
For the year ended December 31, 2016 $ 4.48

Operations 0.47
For the year ended December 31, 2017 $ 3.88 (13.4 )%

 17

Income Taxes – Our effective income tax rate for 2017 increased by 12.8 percentage points to 40.7%. The 2017 tax items that decreased our diluted EPS by $0.84 per share in the table above were primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017.

The principal elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act relevant to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, were:
•A reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The requirement to pay a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings, including 2017 earnings ("transition tax").

In connection with these elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we recognized a provisional expense of $1.6 billion, which was included as a component of income tax expense as follows:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A provisional charge of $1.4 billion, which represents the transition tax of $2.2 billion, net of a reversal of $0.7 billion of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities on part of the accumulated foreign earnings, and other items of $0.1 billion.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using a rate of 21%, which, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is expected to be in place when such deferred assets and liabilities reverse in the future. In connection with this re-measurement, we recorded a provisional charge of $0.2 billion.

While the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced net earnings by $1.6 billion, there was no net impact on operating cash flows for the year, as the changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable offset the net earnings impact. At December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax payable of $1.7 billion representing the transition tax of $2.2 billion, partially offset by foreign tax credits related to foreign withholding taxes previously paid of $0.5 billion. The income tax payable is due over an 8-year period beginning in 2018. For further details, see Item 8, Note 11. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.

The change in the effective tax rate that decreased our diluted EPS by $0.03 per share in the table above was primarily due to earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.

Currency – The unfavorable currency impact during 2017 results from the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, especially against the Brazilian real, Egyptian pound, Euro, Japanese yen and Turkish lira, partially offset by the Russian ruble. This unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.

Interest – The favorable impact of interest was due primarily to higher interest income, partly offset by higher average debt levels.

Operations – The increase in diluted EPS of $0.47 from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asia: Favorable volume/mix, higher pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Latin America & Canada: Higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix;

partially offset by

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• EEMA: Unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by higher pricing; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• European Union: Unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by higher pricing.

For further details, see the Consolidated Operating Results and Operating Results by Business Segment sections of the following Discussion and Analysis.

2018 Forecasted Results – On February 8, 2018, we announced our forecast for 2018 full-year reported diluted EPS to be in a range of $5.20 to $5.35, representing a projected increase of approximately 34% to 38% at prevailing exchange rates, versus $3.88 in 2017. Excluding a favorable currency impact, at then-prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.16 per share for the full-year 2018, the forecast range represents a projected increase of approximately 7% to 10% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 in 2017.

 18

This forecast assumes:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net revenue growth, excluding excise taxes, of over 8.0%, excluding currency;

- -----------------------------------------
• Operating cash flow of over $9.0 billion;

- -------------------------------------------------------
• Capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion; and

- ---------------------
• No share repurchases.

Following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our 2018 full-year diluted earnings per share forecast -- based on the current interpretation of the legislation -- assumes a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 28%, subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction. The difference between the 21% statutory rate under the new law and our effective rate reflects the fact that we operate in markets outside the United States and is driven by three main factors: foreign tax rate differences, non-deductibility of interest expense and a partial disallowance of foreign tax credits related to the application of the rules for global intangible low-taxed income.

We calculated 2017 adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS of $3.88, plus the $0.84 per share charge related to tax items. During 2017, we did not have an EPS impact related to asset impairment and exit costs.

Adjusted diluted EPS is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). We define adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS adjusted for asset impairment and exit costs, tax items and unusual items. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure as it represents core earnings, improves comparability and helps investors analyze business performance and trends. Adjusted diluted EPS should be considered neither in isolation nor as a substitute for reported diluted EPS prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

This 2018 guidance excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and any unusual events. The factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors represent continuing risks to these projections.

Discussion and Analysis

Critical Accounting Estimates

Item 8, Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In most instances, we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under U.S. GAAP.

The preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, as well as our disclosure of contingencies. If actual amounts differ from previous estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts. Historically, aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

The selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our Audit Committee. The following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions, estimates, accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue Recognition - We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of product has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For our company, this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers. Title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction. The company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience, and these estimates are immaterial. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs for IQOS devices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized, based on a number of factors including historical experience, product failure rates and warranty policies.

Goodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets Valuation - We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review. During the second quarter of 2016, we changed the date of

 19

our annual goodwill impairment test from the first quarter to the second quarter.  The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long-range planning and forecasting process. We had determined that this change in accounting principle was preferable under the circumstances and believe that the change in the annual impairment testing date did not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment charge. While the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis. The impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. To determine the fair value of goodwill, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model, supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of our goodwill was $7.7 billion, which is related to ten reporting units, each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics. The estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2017. To determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method. We concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value. These discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows, which are subject to changes in business conditions, such as volumes and prices, costs to produce, discount rates and estimated capital needs. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated, and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Since the March 28, 2008, spin-off from Altria Group, Inc., we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets.

Marketing and Advertising Costs - We incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising, marketing, consumer engagement and trade promotions. The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program. For volume-based incentives provided to customers, management continually assesses and estimates, by customer, the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made. For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.

Employee Benefit Plans - As discussed in Item 8, Note 13. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements, we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries.

Weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows:

-------------------- ----- -----

 2017 2016
Pension plans 1.51% 1.52%
Postretirement plans 3.79% 3.68%

We anticipate that assumption changes will decrease 2018 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $164 million as compared with approximately $199 million in 2017, excluding amounts related to early retirement programs. The anticipated decrease is primarily due to higher expected return on assets of $21 million, coupled with lower amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for prior service cost of $12 million and unrecognized actuarial gains/losses of $10 million, partially offset by other movements of $8 million.

Weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans.  A fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2018 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $38 million, and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2018 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $54 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis-point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our 2018 pension expense by approximately $45 million. See Item 8, Note 13. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates.

 20

Income Taxes - Income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the United States, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.

The extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes, we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.

The effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our full-year geographic earnings mix projections. Changes in currency exchange rates or earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the effective tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.

For further details, see Item 8, Note 11. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.

Hedging - As discussed below in “Market Risk,” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. For derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting, gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results. If we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions, gains (losses) deferred in stockholders’ (deficit) equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives.

Contingencies - As discussed in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. We and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the pending tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it: (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.

Net revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, net of sales and promotion incentives. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of our cigarettes and other tobacco products combined. Other tobacco products primarily include roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos and do not include reduced-risk products.

Net revenues related to reduced-risk products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, net of sales and promotion incentives. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of our heated tobacco units, IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, which primarily include our e-vapor products.

References to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares throughout this "Discussion and Analysis" are our estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources.

2017 compared with 2016

The following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017, with the year ended December 31, 2016.

Estimated international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding China and the United States, of 2.8 trillion was down by 2.8%.

Our total shipment volume decreased by 2.7%, principally due to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• European Union, notably reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume in Greece, Italy and Spain, partly offset by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• EEMA, notably reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume in Russia, Saudi Arabia - where our cigarette shipment volume declined by 35.8%, impacted by the new excise tax implemented in June 2017 that resulted in the doubling of retail prices - and Ukraine; partly offset by higher cigarette shipment volume in North Africa, notably Algeria, and higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asia, notably reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Pakistan - impacted by excise tax-driven price increases and an increase in the prevalence of illicit trade - and the Philippines; fully offset by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume, mainly in Japan and Korea; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Latin America & Canada, notably reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico.

Excluding the favorable net impact of estimated cigarette and heated tobacco unit inventory movements of approximately 3.3 billion units, our total shipment volume decreased by 3.1%. The favorable inventory movements were driven primarily by approximately 8.5 billion units net in Japan reflecting: the increasing demand for HeatSticks, anticipated to further increase in the first quarter of 2018 following a planned lifting of the restriction on IQOS device sales; the establishment of appropriate distributor inventory levels of heated tobacco units, given the current high dependence on a single manufacturing center; and the transition from air freight to sea freight of heated tobacco units, largely completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. These favorable inventory movements were partly offset by a reduction of combustible product inventory levels, mainly in: the European Union, notably Italy and Spain; EEMA, notably North Africa, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Total Cigarettes and Heated Tobacco Units 798,152 820,340 (2.7 )%

Cigarette shipment volume of Marlboro decreased in: the European Union, mainly due to Greece, Italy and Spain; EEMA, predominantly due to Saudi Arabia, reflecting the impact of the new excise tax implemented in June 2017 that resulted in the doubling of the retail price of Marlboro from SAR 12 to SAR 24 per pack, partly offset by North Africa, notably Algeria and Egypt, and Turkey; Asia, mainly due to Japan and Korea, principally reflecting out-switching to heated tobacco products, partly offset by Indonesia and the Philippines; and Latin America & Canada, mainly due to Argentina and Brazil.

Cigarette shipment volume of the following brands decreased: L&M, mainly due to Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, partly offset by Algeria, Argentina, Colombia and Kazakhstan; Parliament, mainly due to Japan, Russia and Saudi Arabia, partly offset by Kazakhstan; Bond Street, mainly due to Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine; Lark, principally due to Japan; and "Others," mainly due to low-price brands in Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia and Ukraine.

Cigarette shipment volume of the following brands increased: Chesterfield, notably driven by Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Venezuela, partly offset by Italy and Russia; and Philip Morris, mainly driven by Russia and Ukraine, notably reflecting successful portfolio consolidation of local, low-price brands in "Others," partly offset by Argentina and Italy.

Our net revenues and excise taxes on products were as follows:

------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------- ------ -------- ------ - ------ ----- - ----- - --- -

 For the Years Ended December 31, Variance
(in millions) 2017 2016 $ %
Net revenues $ 78,098 $ 74,953 $ 3,145 4.2 %
Excise taxes on products 49,350 48,268 1,082 2.2 %
Net revenues, excluding excise taxes on products $ 28,748 $ 26,685 $ 2,063 7.7 %

Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, increased by $3.1 billion. Excluding excise taxes, net revenues increased by $2.1 billion, due to:

- ----------------------------------
• price increases ($1.4 billion) and

- -----------------------------------------------------
• favorable volume/mix ($1.1 billion), partly offset by

- ------------------------------------
• unfavorable currency ($437 million).

The unfavorable currency was due primarily to the Argentine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen, Philippine peso and Turkish lira, partially offset by the Russian ruble.

 25

Net revenues include $3.8 billion in 2017 and $739 million in 2016 related to the sale of RRPs, mainly driven by Japan. These net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers. Excluding excise taxes, net revenues for RRPs were $3.6 billion in 2017 and $733 million in 2016. In some jurisdictions, including Japan, we are not responsible for collecting excise taxes. In 2017, approximately $0.9 billion of our $3.6 billion in RRP net revenues, excluding excise taxes, were from IQOS devices and accessories.

Excise taxes on products increased by $1.1 billion, due to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher excise taxes resulting from changes in retail prices and tax rates ($4.6 billion), partially offset by

- -------------------------------------
• favorable currency ($1.9 billion) and

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• lower excise taxes resulting from volume/mix ($1.6 billion).

Our cost of sales; marketing, administration and research costs; and operating income were as follows:

-------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ------ -------- ------ - ----- --- - ----- - ---- -

 For the Years Ended December 31, Variance
(in millions) 2017 2016 $ %
Cost of sales $ 10,432 $ 9,391 $ 1,041 11.1 %
Marketing, administration and research costs 6,725 6,405 320 5.0 %
Operating income 11,503 10,815 688 6.4 %

Cost of sales increased by $1.0 billion, due to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher cost of sales resulting from volume/mix ($1.1 billion), partly offset by

- -------------------------------------------
• lower manufacturing costs ($36 million) and

- ---------------------------------
• favorable currency ($30 million).

Marketing, administration and research costs increased by $320 million, due to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher expenses ($570 million, largely reflecting increased investment behind reduced-risk products, predominately in the European Union and Asia), partly offset by

- ----------------------------------
• favorable currency ($250 million).

Operating income increased by $688 million, due primarily to:

- ------------------------------------------------
• price increases ($1.4 billion), partly offset by

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher marketing, administration and research costs ($570 million) and

- ------------------------------------
• unfavorable currency ($157 million).

Interest expense, net, of $914 million increased by $23 million, due primarily to unfavorably currency and higher average debt levels, partly offset by higher interest income.

Our effective tax rate increased by 12.8 percentage points to 40.7%. The 2017 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by $1.6 billion due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For further details, see Item 8, Note 11. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements. We are continuing to evaluate the impact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have on our tax liability. Based upon our current interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we estimate that our 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 28%, subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.

We are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world, and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties. An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.

Net earnings attributable to PMI of $6.0 billion decreased by $932 million (13.4%). This decrease was due primarily to a higher effective tax rate as discussed above, partly offset by higher operating income. Diluted and basic EPS of $3.88 decreased by 13.4%. Excluding

 26

an unfavorable tax impact of $0.84 primarily related to the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and an unfavorable currency impact of $0.21, diluted EPS increased by 10.0%.

2016 compared with 2015

The following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, with the year ended December 31, 2015.
Our cigarette shipment volume decreased by 4.1%, or by 4.7% excluding net estimated inventory movements, due to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• European Union, principally Italy, Germany and Greece, partly offset by Poland and Spain;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• EEMA, mainly North Africa, primarily Algeria, and Russia, partly offset by Saudi Arabia and Ukraine;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asia, principally Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand, partly offset by Korea; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Latin America & Canada, predominantly Argentina, partly offset by Mexico.

Our cigarette market share increased in a number of markets, including Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Czech Republic, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

Our cigarette shipment volume by brand is shown in the table below:

------------------------------------------------------ --------- ------- ------ --

Others 234,442 269,276 (12.9 )%
Total PMI 812,946 847,270 (4.1 )%

Cigarette shipment volume of Marlboro decreased, driven by Algeria, Argentina, Egypt and Vietnam, as well as in-switching to heated tobacco units, partly offset by Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Spain.

Cigarette shipment volume of L&M decreased, notably in Russia, Thailand and Turkey, partly offset by Algeria, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. Cigarette shipment volume of Chesterfield increased, mainly driven by Argentina, the Czech Republic, reflecting the morphing of Red & White, Turkey and the United Kingdom, partly offset by Russia. Cigarette shipment volume of Parliament increased, mainly driven by Korea, Turkey and Ukraine, partly offset by Japan and Russia. Cigarette shipment volume of Bond Street increased, mainly driven by Ukraine, partly offset by Kazakhstan. Cigarette shipment volume of Philip Morris increased, driven mainly by Italy and Russia, partly offset by Argentina. Cigarette shipment volume of Lark decreased, principally due to Japan and Turkey. Cigarette shipment volume of "Others" decreased, mainly due to local, largely low-margin brands in Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia and Ukraine.

Total shipment volume of heated tobacco units reached 7.4 billion units, up from 396 million units in 2015.

Net revenues $ 74,953 $ 73,908 $ 1,045 1.4 %
Excise taxes on products 48,268 47,114 1,154 2.4 %
Net revenues, excluding excise taxes on products $ 26,685 $ 26,794 $ (109 ) (0.4 )%

Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, increased by $1.0 billion. Excluding excise taxes, net revenues decreased by $109 million, due to:

- ---------------------------------------
• unfavorable currency ($1.3 billion) and

- -------------------------------------------------------
• unfavorable volume/mix ($450 million), partly offset by

- -------------------------------
• price increases ($1.6 billion).

The unfavorable currency was due primarily to the Argentine peso, Canadian dollar, Egyptian pound, Euro, Kazakh tenge, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, Russian ruble and Turkish lira, partially offset by the Japanese yen.

Net revenues include $739 million in 2016 related to sale of RRPs, mainly driven by Japan. This amount includes excise taxes billed to customers. Excluding excise taxes, net revenues for RRPs were $733 million in 2016. In some jurisdictions, including Japan, we are not responsible for collecting excise taxes. Approximately 22% of our $733 million in 2016 RRP net revenues, excluding excise taxes, were from IQOS devices.

Excise taxes on products increased by $1.2 billion, due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• higher excise taxes resulting from changes in retail prices and tax rates ($5.3 billion), partly offset by

- -------------------------------------
• favorable currency ($3.9 billion) and

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• lower excise taxes resulting from volume/mix ($236 million).

Our cost of sales; marketing, administration and research costs; and operating income were as follows:

• higher cost of sales resulting from volume/mix ($242 million), partly offset by

- ----------------------------------
• favorable currency ($216 million).

 28

Marketing, administration and research costs decreased by $251 million, due to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower expenses ($210 million, driven by a favorable comparison to 2015, notably related to cigarette brand building and business optimization initiatives, partly offset by increased support behind Reduced-Risk Products) and

- ---------------------------------
• favorable currency ($41 million).

Operating income increased by $192 million, due primarily to:

- -------------------------------
• price increases ($1.6 billion),

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower marketing, administration and research costs ($210 million) and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the non-recurrence of the 2015 pre-tax charges for asset impairment and exit costs ($68 million), partly offset by

- ---------------------------------------
• unfavorable currency ($1.0 billion) and

- --------------------------------------
• unfavorable volume/mix ($692 million).

Interest expense, net, of $891 million decreased by $117 million, due primarily to lower effective interest rates on debt and higher interest income.

Our effective tax rate decreased by 0.1 percentage point to 27.9%. The 2015 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by changes to repatriation assertions on certain foreign subsidiary historical earnings ($58 million), partially offset by a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $41 million following the conclusion of the IRS examinations of Altria Group, Inc.'s consolidated tax returns for the years 2007 and 2008 and PMI's consolidated tax returns for the years 2009 through 2011. Prior to March 28, 2008, PMI was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc.

Net earnings attributable to PMI of $7.0 billion increased by $94 million (1.4%). This increase was due primarily to higher operating income as discussed above, and lower interest expense, net. Diluted and basic EPS of $4.48 increased by 1.4%. Excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.46, diluted EPS increased by 11.8%.

Operating Results by Business Segment

Business Environment
Taxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products
The tobacco industry and our business face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. These challenges, which are discussed below and in “Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results,” include:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotine-containing products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called “illicit whites”;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies; and

- ----------------------------
• governmental investigations.

Regulatory Restrictions: The tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment. The well-known risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.

We support a comprehensive regulatory framework for tobacco products based on the principle of harm reduction, including mandated health warnings, minimum age laws, restrictions on advertising, and public place smoking restrictions. We also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade.

 29

Much of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the World Health Organization's (“WHO”) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”), which entered into force in 2005. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and has as its main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 180 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others. The FCTC governing body, the Conference of the Parties (“CoP”), has also adopted non-binding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty.

We have opposed certain measures and continue to engage in a dialogue with regulators with respect to those measures that we do not believe would protect public health and, if implemented, could disrupt competition, severely limit our ability to market and sell our products to adult smokers, or increase illicit trade. Certain measures are discussed in more detail below. It is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended in the FCTC guidelines will be implemented.

Fiscal Challenges: Excessive and disruptive excise, sales and other tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability, due to lower consumption and consumer down-trading to non-premium, discount, other low-price or low-taxed combustible tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit cigarettes. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, some of our combustible products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premium-price products and manufactured cigarettes. We believe that such tax policies undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to illicit trade, and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives, disrupt the competitive environment, and encourage criminal activity. Other jurisdictions have imposed, or are seeking to impose, levies or other taxes specifically on tobacco companies, such as taxes on revenues and/or profits.

EU Tobacco Products Directive: In April 2014, the EU adopted the text of a significantly revised EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), which entered into force in May 2016. All 28 Member States and Norway have adopted laws transposing the TPD.  The TPD sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products, including:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• health warnings covering 65% of the front and back panels of cigarette packs, with an option for Member States to further standardize tobacco packaging, including the introduction of plain packaging;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a ban on characterizing flavors in some tobacco products, with a transition period for menthol expiring in May 2020;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• security features and tracking and tracing measures that will become effective on May 20, 2019, and will increase operational expenses; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a framework for the regulation of novel tobacco products and e-cigarettes, including requirements for health warnings and information leaflets, a prohibition on product packaging text related to reduced risk, and the introduction of notification requirements or authorization procedures in advance of commercialization.

Plain Packaging and Other Packaging Restrictions: Plain packaging legislation bans the use of branding, logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font. To date, Australia, France, Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Slovenia and the U.K. have adopted plain packaging laws, which are in various degrees of implementation.

Several countries have initiated World Trade Organization (“WTO”) dispute settlement proceedings against Australia related to Australia's plain packaging legislation. The matter is still pending before the WTO panel.

Other countries are also considering adopting plain packaging legislation, including, but not limited to, Canada, Singapore, South Africa and Turkey.

Some countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging. Examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages, prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.

Restrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients: The WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products, including menthol. Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term. Menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products. The European Union has banned flavored tobacco products, subject to an exemption until May 2020 for menthol. Other countries may follow the EU’s approach. For instance, Turkey has banned menthol as of May 2020. Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Canada and Brazil. While the Canadian ingredient ban initially exempted menthol, amendments to the federal Tobacco Act banned menthol in cigarettes as of October 2017. In addition, the Canadian parliament is considering further amendments to the Act that would extend the menthol ban to all tobacco products. The majority of Canadian provinces have also adopted or are in the process of adopting menthol bans. The Brazil ingredients

 30

ban, which would prohibit the use of virtually all ingredients with flavoring or aromatic properties, is not in force due to a legal challenge by a tobacco industry union, of which our Brazilian subsidiary is a member. Other lawsuits are also pending against the Brazil ingredients ban. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings.

Bans on Display of Tobacco Products at Retail: In a number of our markets, including, but not limited to, Australia, Canada, Norway, Russia, and Singapore, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale. Other countries are also considering similar bans.

Bans and Restrictions on Advertising, Marketing, Promotions and Sponsorships: For many years, the FCTC has called for, and countries have imposed, partial or total bans on tobacco advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorships, including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television, in print and on the Internet. The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.

Restrictions on Product Design: Some members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted non-binding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.

Restrictions on Public Smoking: The pace and scope of public smoking restrictions have increased significantly in most of our markets. Many countries around the world have adopted, or are likely to adopt, regulations that restrict or ban smoking in public and/or work places, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Some public health groups have called for, and some countries, regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, as well as bans on smoking in cars (typically, when minors are present) and private homes.

Other Regulatory Issues: Some regulators are considering, or in some cases have adopted, regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products. These include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by, for example, reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within arbitrary distances of certain public facilities.

In a limited number of markets, most notably Japan, we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility.

Illicit Trade: The illicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products, undermines efforts to reduce smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses, stimulates organized crime, increases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. Illicit trade may account for as much as 10% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the growing problem of “illicit whites,” which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. We estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for slightly less than 10% of total cigarette consumption in 2016.

A number of jurisdictions are considering actions to prevent illicit trade. In November 2012, the FCTC adopted the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (the “Protocol”), which includes supply chain control measures, such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors, enforcement in free trade zones, controls on duty free and Internet sales and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies. To date, 54 Parties have signed the Protocol, and 35 Parties, including the European Union, have ratified it. The Protocol will come into force once the fortieth Party ratifies it, after which countries must implement its measures via national legislation. We expect, and welcome, that other Parties will ratify the Protocol.

As discussed in the EU Tobacco Products Directive section above, the EU regulations that mandate tracking and tracing of cigarettes and roll-your-own products manufactured or destined for the EU will become effective on May 20, 2019. The effective date for other tobacco-containing products, including some of our RRPs such as the heated tobacco units used with IQOS, is May 20, 2024.

In 2009, our Colombian subsidiaries entered into an Investment and Cooperation Agreement with the national and regional governments of Colombia to promote investment in, and cooperation on, anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit efforts. The agreement provides $200 million in funding over a 20-year period to address issues such as combating the illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locally-grown tobacco.

In May 2016, PMI launched PMI IMPACT, a global initiative that supports third-party projects dedicated to fighting illegal trade and related crimes such as corruption, organized criminal networks and money laundering. The centerpiece of PMI IMPACT is a council of external independent experts with impeccable credentials in the fields of law, anti-corruption and law enforcement. The experts are

 31

responsible for evaluating and approving funding proposals for PMI IMPACT grants. PMI has pledged $100 million to fund projects within PMI IMPACT over three funding rounds. Substantially all grants under the first funding round were awarded in 2017. The second funding round began in September 2017.

In November 2016, PMI signed a joint Declaration of Intent to Prevent the Maritime Transportation of Counterfeit Goods together with eight other global brand owners and five of the world’s largest shipping companies. This commitment was a result of a dialogue with the International Chamber of Commerce’s Business Action to Stop Counterfeiting and Piracy. The signatories aim to tackle the infiltration of shipping services by criminal networks that exploit vessels to transport counterfeit goods, including “illicit whites,” across the oceans.

Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs)

Our Approach to RRPs: We recognize that smoking cigarettes causes serious diseases and that the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or to quit. Nevertheless, it is predicted that over the next decade the number of smokers will remain largely unchanged from the current estimate of 1.1 billion, despite the considerable efforts to discourage smoking.

Cigarettes burn tobacco, which produces smoke. As a result of the combustion process, the smoker inhales various toxic substances. In contrast, RRPs do not burn tobacco and produce an aerosol that contains significantly lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents ("HPHCs") than found in cigarette smoke.

For smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke, we believe that RRPs offer a much better consumer choice. Accordingly, our key strategic priorities are: to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those products.

We recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to RRPs will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control, such as the willingness of governments, regulators and other policy groups to embrace RRPs as a desired alternative to continued cigarette smoking. We also recognize that our part in this transformation must be funded from our existing cigarette business. For as long as a significant number of adult smokers continues to smoke, it is critical that the industry be led by responsible and ethical manufacturers. Therefore, during the transformation, we intend to remain a leading international cigarette manufacturer.

We have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. We conduct rigorous scientific assessments of our RRP platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to HPHCs and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking. We draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our RRPs. Our efforts are guided by the following key objectives:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to develop RRPs that adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke find to be satisfying alternatives to smoking;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• for those adult smokers, our goal is to offer RRPs with a scientifically substantiated risk-reduction profile that approaches as closely as possible that associated with smoking cessation;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to substantiate the reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker and the reduction of harm to the population as a whole, based on scientific evidence of the highest standard that is made available for scrutiny and review by external independent scientists and relevant regulatory bodies; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs, including the communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices.

Our RRP Platforms: Our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation, which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke. We recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers. Therefore, we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences.

Four RRP platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness:

         Platform 1 uses a precisely controlled heating device that we are commercializing under the IQOS brand name, into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. We have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform, the results of which were included in our submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) described below. As anticipated, the results of the first six-month term of the 6+6 month exposure response study were received at the

 32

end of 2017, and the related report is under preparation. We expect to submit the final report for these results to the FDA in May of 2018. We expect to receive the results of the second six-month term of the study for analysis in the second quarter of 2018.

     Platform 2 uses a pressed carbon heat source which, when ignited, generates an aerosol by heating tobacco. The results of our pharmacokinetic study (that measured the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile and subjective effects) and of our five-day reduced exposure study with Platform 2 indicate that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who seek an alternative to cigarettes. Furthermore, the reduced exposure study showed a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs in those who switched to Platform 2 compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a five-day period. The sustainability of this reduction as well as changes in clinical risk markers were assessed in a 3-month reduced exposure study. As anticipated, the results of this study were received at the end of 2017, and the related report is under preparation. We expect the report to be finalized in the second quarter of 2018. Subsequently, in accordance with standard scientific practices, we intend to share the conclusions in scientific forums and to submit them for inclusion in peer-reviewed publications.

     Platform 3 provides an aerosol of nicotine salt formed by the chemical reaction of nicotine with a weak organic acid. We have explored two routes for this platform, one with electronics and one without, and have initiated a new nicotine pharmacokinetic study. We expect to receive the results for analysis in the second quarter of 2018.

     Platform 4 covers e-vapor products, which are battery-powered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a nicotine-containing liquid solution. Our e-vapor products comprise devices using current generation technology, and we are well advanced in the development and commercialization of our new e-vapor mesh technology that addresses certain challenges presented by some e-vapor products currently on the market. Our MESH products are designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol. We have initiated a nicotine pharmacokinetic study for which we expect to receive the results for analysis in the second quarter of 2018; the results of this study are expected to contribute to further developments of Platform 4 products.

Commercialization of RRPs: We are building a new product category and tailor our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market. We focus our commercialization efforts on retail experience, guided consumer trials and customer care, as well as digital communication programs.  In order to accelerate switching to IQOS, our initial market introductions typically entail one-on-one consumer engagement and introductory device discounts.  These initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment.

In 2014, we introduced the IQOS system in pilot city launches in Nagoya, Japan, and in Milan, Italy. Since then, we have expanded our commercialization activities to include all of Japan, as well as multiple cities in Italy. To date, IQOS is available for sale in key cities in 37 markets and nationwide in Japan.

On the basis of our experience in Japan and Italy, we estimate that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to IQOS switch back to cigarettes.

In the first quarter of 2016, we started the large scale commercial production of heated tobacco units. During 2017, we experienced supply shortages resulting from stronger-than-anticipated demand, primarily in Japan. Currently, we are no longer experiencing capacity limitations. We are integrating the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities and progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other RRP platforms.

In 2017, we secured a second supplier of IQOS devices. We are no longer experiencing supply constraints on the IQOS devices and, based on demand forecasts, we expect to be able to fully supply our current and planned launch markets with such devices.

The adequate supply chain for our RRP portfolio, including the supply of electronic devices, is important to our business. We work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our IQOS devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our RRP portfolio and related accessories. Although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health, the commercialization of our RRPs could be adversely affected if they are unable to meet their commitments. The production of our RRP portfolio requires various metals, and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements. However, some components and materials necessary for the production of our RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. Our inability to secure an adequate supply of such components and materials could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.

Our IQOS devices are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law. We discuss product warranties in more detail in Note 5. Product Warranty. The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors including warranty policies and product failure rates and may increase with the number of devices sold.

 33

To further improve the consumer experience, we introduced a new version of the IQOS device in the first quarter of 2017 and continue to develop product improvements.

We are also progressing with our commercialization efforts for the other platforms:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We currently market our e-vapor products in several markets, including Ireland, Israel, Spain and the U.K. A city test of MESH, one of our Platform 4 products, is ongoing in Birmingham, U.K., and we expect to initiate a pilot launch of a next-generation version of this product in 2018.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In December 2017, we initiated a small-scale city test of TEEPS, our Platform 2 product, in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we plan to conduct a consumer test of our Platform 3 product.

RRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. We therefore support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs. Regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. Regulation should provide minimum standards for RRPs and specific rules for product assessment methodologies, ingredients, labelling and consumer communication, and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and non-combustible tobacco and nicotine-containing products. Regulation, as well as tobacco industry activities, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.

Some governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs. These regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke. We oppose such blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.

In the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing “Modified Risk Tobacco Products” and “New Tobacco Products” exists under the jurisdiction of the FDA. We submitted to the FDA a Modified Risk Tobacco Product Application (“MRTPA”) for IQOS in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (“PMTA”) for IQOS in March 2017. In May 2017, the FDA formally accepted and filed our MRTPA for substantive scientific review and, in June 2017, the FDA opened the period for the public to provide comments on our application. In August 2017, the FDA completed a preliminary review of our PMTA and accepted our application for substantive review. The FDA referred our MRTPA to the Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee (“TPSAC”). TPSAC held a meeting on January 24 and January 25, 2018 on our MRTPA. The recommendations and votes of TPSAC are not binding on the FDA. By regulation, the FDA’s decision on our MRTPA will take into account, in addition to the views of TPSAC, scientific evidence as well as comments, data and information submitted by interested persons.

Separately, on July 28, 2017, the FDA issued a policy announcement aiming to explore the potential of nicotine reduction in cigarettes in conjunction with less harmful products that deliver nicotine for adults who choose to use such products.

Future FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.

In the EU, all EU Member States and Norway have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated tobacco units, and e-cigarettes. Most of the EU Member States require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of a novel tobacco product, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of IQOS in 22 Member States.

On December 12, 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heated tobacco products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two heated tobacco products, one of which was IQOS. The assessment concluded that, while still harmful to health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heated tobacco products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, on February 6, 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heated tobacco products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.

 34

We make our scientific findings publicly available for scrutiny and peer review through several channels, including our websites. From time to time, adult consumers, competitors, members of the scientific community, and others inquire into our scientific methodologies, challenge our scientific conclusions or request further study of certain aspects of our RRPs and their health effects. We are committed to a robust and open scientific debate but believe that such debate should be based on accurate and reliable scientific information. We seek to provide accurate and reliable scientific information about our RRPs; nonetheless, we may not be able to prevent third-party dissemination of false, misleading or unsubstantiated information about these products.

To date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our RRPs are not cigarettes, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Although we believe that this is sensible from the public health perspective, we cannot guarantee that regulators will continue this approach.

There can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with RRPs or that regulation will allow us to commercialize RRPs in all markets, to communicate scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims, or to treat RRPs differently from cigarettes.

Our RRP Business Development Initiatives: In December 2013, we established a strategic framework with Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) under which Altria will make available its e-vapor products exclusively to us for commercialization outside the United States, and we will make available two of our RRPs exclusively to Altria for commercialization in the United States. In March 2015, we launched Solaris, a Platform 4 e-vapor product licensed from Altria, in Spain. In December 2015, we introduced Solaris in Israel.

In July 2015, we extended the strategic framework with Altria to include a Joint Research, Development and Technology Sharing Agreement. The additional agreement provides the framework under which PMI and Altria will collaborate to develop the next generation of e-vapor products for commercialization in the United States by Altria and in markets outside the United States by PMI. The collaboration between PMI and Altria in this endeavor is enabled by exclusive technology cross licenses and technical information sharing. The agreements also provide for cooperation on the scientific assessment of, and for the sharing of improvements to, the existing generation of licensed products.

Other Developments: On September 12, 2017, we announced our support of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. We agreed to contribute $80 million per year over the next 12 years, as specified in the agreement. We made an initial contribution of $4.5 million in 2017 and the first annual contribution of $80 million in the beginning of 2018. The Foundation is an independent body and is governed by its independent Board of Directors. The Foundation’s role, as set out in its corporate charter, includes funding research in the field of tobacco harm reduction, encouraging measures that reduce the harm caused by smoking, and assessing the effect of reduced cigarette consumption on the industry value chain.

Governmental Investigations

From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. We describe certain matters pending in Thailand and South Korea in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.

In November 2010, a WTO panel issued its decision in a dispute relating to facts that arose from August 2006 between the Philippines and Thailand concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by PM Thailand into Thailand (see Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies for additional information). The WTO panel decision, which was upheld by the WTO Appellate Body, concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the DSI in 2009. The decision also created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports. Thailand agreed in September 2011 to fully comply with the decision by October 2012. The Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision. The Philippines has repeatedly expressed concerns with ongoing investigations by Thailand of PM Thailand, including those that led to the criminal charges described in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies, and has commenced two formal proceedings at the WTO to challenge criminal charges against PM Thailand arguing that the criminal charges appear to be based on grounds not supported by WTO customs valuation rules and inconsistent with several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and other Thai governmental agencies.

Acquisitions and Other Business Arrangements

We discuss our acquisitions and other business arrangements in Item 8, Note 6. Acquisitions and Other Business Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements.

 35

Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

We discuss our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in Item 8, Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries to our consolidated financial statements.

Trade Policy

We are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the United States of America and countries in which we do business (“Trade Sanctions”), including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of State. It is our policy to comply fully with these Trade Sanctions.

Tobacco products are agricultural products under U.S. law and are not technological or strategic in nature. From time to time we make sales in countries subject to Trade Sanctions, either where such sanctions do not apply to our business or pursuant to exemptions or licenses.

To our knowledge, none of our commercial arrangements results in the governments of any country identified by the U.S. government as a state sponsor of terrorism, nor entities controlled by those governments, receiving cash or acting as intermediaries in violation of U.S. laws.

We do not sell products in Iran, Sudan, North Korea and Syria. From time to time, we explore opportunities to sell our products in one or more of these countries, as permitted by law.

In January 2018, we commenced sales of cigarettes in Cuba, as permitted by law.

Certain states within the U.S. have enacted legislation permitting state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the U.S. We do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares.

The estimated total market in Asia, excluding China, decreased by 3.1% to 1.1 trillion units. Our Regional market share, excluding China, was flat at 23.8%.

Our total shipment volume of 267.0 billion units was flat, mainly reflecting: lower cigarette shipment volume in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Pakistan - impacted by excise tax-driven price increases in 2017 and an increase in the prevalence of illicit trade - and the Philippines, fully offset by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume, mainly in Japan and Korea. The decrease in cigarette shipment volume of Marlboro was mainly due to Japan and Korea, primarily reflecting out-switching to heated tobacco products, partly offset by Indonesia and the Philippines. The decrease in cigarette shipment volume of Lark was principally due to Japan. The decrease in cigarette shipment

volume of Parliament was mainly due to Japan and Korea. The decrease in cigarette shipment volume of "Others" was mainly due to local, low-price brands in Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines.

Our total shipment volume benefited from the favorable net impact of estimated combustible and heated tobacco unit inventory movements, which were driven by approximately 8.5 billion units net in Japan, reflecting: the increasing demand for HeatSticks, anticipated to further increase in the first quarter of 2018 following a planned lifting of the restriction on IQOS device sales; the establishment of appropriate distributor inventory levels of heated tobacco units, given the current high dependence on a single manufacturing center; and the transition from air freight to sea freight of heated tobacco units, largely completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of total estimated net inventory movements, our total shipment volume decreased by 3.1%.

Asia - PMI Cigarette Shipment Volume Commentaries

Our cigarette shipment volume decreased by 7.6% to 260.0 billion units, mainly due to: Indonesia; Pakistan, reflecting a lower total estimated cigarette market resulting from excise tax-driven price increases and the growth of illicit trade; the Philippines; and Thailand, primarily reflecting the impact of excise tax-driven price increases in the first quarter of 2016, as well as lower market share; and in-switching from our cigarette brands to heated tobacco units; partly offset by Korea, reflecting a normalization of the total estimated cigarette market following the disruptive excise tax increase in January 2015.

Cigarette shipment volume of Marlboro increased by 4.0% to 76.5 billion units, mainly driven by Korea and the Philippines, partly offset by Vietnam, as well as in-switching from that brand to heated tobacco units. Cigarette shipment volume of Parliament increased by 7.5% to 10.1 billion units, driven by Korea. Cigarette shipment volume of Lark decreased by 3.8% to 17.6 billion units, principally due to Japan.

The estimated total cigarette market decreased by 1.4%, mainly reflecting a soft economic environment and the impact of excise tax-driven price increases. The decrease in our cigarette shipments was mainly due to lower market share, reflecting the soft performance of our SKM portfolio, due to competitors' discounted product offerings, and our SKT portfolio, broadly in line with industry trends, as well as a lower estimated total market.

Excluding the net impact of distributor inventory movements, our cigarette shipment volume decreased by 6.5%. The decline was mainly due to a lower total cigarette market, as well as lower cigarette market share, reflecting the impact of competitors' retail pricing, competitors' differentiated menthol taste product offerings and in-switching from our cigarette brands to heated tobacco units.

The estimated national market share of heated tobacco units was 2.9%, bringing our total combined national market share to 27.1%, up by 1.7 points.

Financial Review

Ÿ Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $8.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $0.8 billion from the comparable 2016 period. While the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced net earnings by $1.6 billion, there was no net impact on operating cash flows for the year, as the changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable offset the net earnings impact. Excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as favorable currency movements of $0.4 billion, the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities can be attributed to higher net earnings offset by working capital and other movements.

At December 31, 2017, PMI recorded an income tax payable of $1.7 billion representing the transition tax of $2.2 billion, partially offset by foreign tax credits related to foreign withholding taxes previously paid of $0.5 billion. The income tax payable is due over an 8-year period beginning in 2018. For further details, see Item 8, Note 11. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $8.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $212 million from the comparable 2015 period. Excluding unfavorable currency movements of $409 million, the change was due primarily to net earnings growth and lower cash payments related to exit costs, partly offset by higher working capital requirements and 2016 installment payments of security into a court trust pertaining to the Létourneau and Blais cases as well as a 2016 payment to the South Korean tax authorities (see Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies for additional information).
Excluding currency, the unfavorable variance in working capital was due primarily to the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• more cash used for accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of sales and cash collections (including unfavorable comparisons to the cash flows provided for accounts receivable in 2015 following the expansion of arrangements to sell accounts receivable to unaffiliated financial institutions as disclosed in Item 8, Note 20. Sale of Accounts Receivable), partly offset by

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• more cash provided by accrued liabilities and other current assets, primarily due to the timing of payments for excise taxes.

 62

Ÿ Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $2.0 billion from the comparable 2016 period. This increase in net cash used of $2.0 billion was due principally to cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets following the strengthening of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar, and higher capital expenditures. For further details on our derivatives designated as net investment hedges, see Item 8, Note 15. Financial Instruments.

Net cash used in investing activities of $968 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $260 million from the comparable 2015 period, due primarily to higher capital expenditures.

Our capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in 2017, $1.2 billion in 2016 and $1.0 billion in 2015. The 2017 expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in RRPs to support capacity expansion (notably for heated tobacco units). We expect total capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $1.7 billion (including additional capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in RRPs to support capacity expansion), to be funded by operating cash flows.

Ÿ Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

During 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $2.8 billion, compared with net cash used in financing activities of $5.4 billion during 2016 and $4.7 billion in 2015.

The 2017 change was due primarily to higher proceeds from long-term debt issuances (primarily the $6.9 billion proceeds in 2017 from our U.S. dollar and Euro debt issuances versus the $3.5 billion proceeds in 2016 from our U.S. dollar and Euro debt issuances).

The 2016 change was due primarily to lower net proceeds received from the sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by higher proceeds from long-term debt issuances. For further details on the proceeds from the sale of subsidiary shares in 2015, see Item 8, Note 6. Acquisitions and Other Business Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements.

Dividends paid in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $6.5 billion, $6.4 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.

Ÿ Debt and Liquidity

We define cash and cash equivalents as short-term, highly liquid investments, readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes. As a policy, we do not hold any investments in structured or equity-linked products. Our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in demand deposits with institutions that have investment-grade long-term credit rating. As part of our cash management strategy and in order to manage counterparty exposure, we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements. Such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and, at maturity, cash is paid back to PMI and the collateral is returned to the bank. While we entered into these agreements during the periods and had an average balance during 2017 and 2016 of $0.9 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, we had a zero balance both at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
We utilize long-term and short-term debt financing, including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements, as part of our overall cash management strategy. Our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs. We expect that the combination of our long-term and short-term debt financing, the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities, coupled with our operating cash flows, will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements.

Credit Ratings – The cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings. At February 9, 2018, our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows:

----------------- ---------- --------- --------

 Short-term Long-term Outlook
Moody’s P-1 A2 Stable
Standard & Poor’s A-1 A Negative
Fitch F1 A Negative

Credit Facilities – On January 29, 2018, we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility from February 6, 2018, to February 5, 2019. On August 29, 2017, we entered into an agreement, effective October 1, 2017, to

 63

extend the term of our $3.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period October 1, 2021 to October 1, 2022.

At February 9, 2018, our committed credit facilities were as follows:

------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ---

(in billions)
Type CommittedCreditFacilities
364-day revolving credit, expiring February 5, 2019 $ 2.0
Multi-year revolving credit, expiring February 28, 2021 2.5
Multi-year revolving credit, expiring October 1, 2022 3.5
Total facilities $ 8.0

At February 9, 2018, there were no borrowings under the committed credit facilities, and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing.

All banks participating in our committed credit facilities have an investment-grade long-term credit rating from the credit rating agencies. We continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group, and at this time we are not aware of any potential non-performing credit provider.

Each of these facilities requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“consolidated EBITDA”) to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1.0 on a rolling four-quarter basis. At December 31, 2017, our ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 10.6 to 1.0. These facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral. We expect to continue to meet our covenants. The terms “consolidated EBITDA” and “consolidated interest expense,” both of which include certain adjustments, are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above, certain of our subsidiaries maintain short-term credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs. These credit arrangements, which amounted to approximately $2.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2016, are for the sole use of our subsidiaries. Borrowings under these arrangements amounted to $499 million at December 31, 2017, and $643 million at December 31, 2016.

Commercial Paper Program – We continue to have access to liquidity in the commercial paper market through programs in place in the U.S. and in Europe having an aggregate issuance capacity of $8.0 billion. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had no commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper balance outstanding during 2017 and 2016 was $5.2 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.

Sale of Accounts Receivable – To mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions. These arrangements allow us to sell, on an ongoing basis, certain trade receivables without recourse. The trade receivables sold are generally short-term in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets. We sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements, servicing and nonservicing.

Our operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets, which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions. The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1,092 million, $729 million and $888 million, respectively. The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

For further details, see Item 8, Note 20. Sale of Accounts Receivable to our consolidated financial statements.

Debt – Our total debt was $34.3 billion at December 31, 2017, and $29.1 billion at December 31, 2016. Our total debt is primarily fixed rate in nature. For further details, see Item 8, Note 7. Indebtedness. The weighted-average all-in financing cost of our total debt was 2.6% in 2017, compared to 2.8% in 2016. See Item 8, Note 16. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our disclosures related to the fair value of debt. The amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.

• Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations discussed below.

Guarantees – At December 31, 2017, we were contingently liable for $0.9 billion of guarantees of our own performance, which were primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products. There is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees. At December 31, 2017, our third-party guarantees were insignificant.

 65

Aggregate Contractual Obligations – The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017:

------------------------------- ------ ------------ --------- --------- ------------------- ----- ------- ----- ------ -------

 Payments Due
(in millions) Total 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 2023 and Thereafter
Long-term debt (1) $34,120 $2,506 $8,221 $5,811 $17,582

 $53,838 $7,857 $11,999 $8,201 $25,781

(1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
(2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt. Interest on our fixed-rate debt is presented using the stated interest rate. Interest on our variable debt is estimated using the rate in effect at December 31, 2017. Amounts exclude the amortization of debt discounts, the amortization of loan fees and fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.
(3) Amounts represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(4) Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Amounts represent the minimum commitments under non-cancelable contracts. Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.
(5) Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of postretirement health care costs and accruals established for employment costs. The following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension and postemployment costs, tax contingencies, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to estimate the timing of payments (or contributions in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. Currently, we anticipate making pension contributions of approximately $53 million in 2018, based on current tax and benefit laws (as discussed in Item 8, Note 13. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements).

Ÿ Equity and Dividends

We discuss our stock awards as of December 31, 2017, in Item 8, Note 9. Stock Plans to our consolidated financial statements.

During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program and we do not presently intend to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2018.

Dividends paid in 2017 were $6.5 billion. During the third quarter of 2017, our Board of Directors approved a 2.9% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.07 per common share. As a result, the present annualized dividend rate is $4.28 per common share.

Market Risk

Ÿ Counterparty Risk - We predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short- and long-term credit ratings as assigned by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. These banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks. Non-investment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs. We have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments. As such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equity-linked products. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested in demand deposits maturing within less than 30 days.

We continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties.

Ÿ Derivative Financial Instruments - We operate in markets outside of the U.S., with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world. Consequently, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure. We use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign

 66

exchange rates by creating offsetting exposures. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

See Item 8, Note 15. Financial Instruments, Item 8, Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Item 8, Note 19. Balance Sheet Offsetting to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements.

Ÿ Value at Risk - We use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive financial instruments and to estimate the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our foreign currency price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. This computation includes our debt, short-term investments, and foreign currency forwards, swaps and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.

The computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval. We use a “variance/co-variance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average value at risk amounts during each year. The values of foreign currency options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency and were valued accordingly in the computation.

The estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, under normal market conditions and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from foreign currency instruments under normal market conditions, as calculated in the value at risk model, were as follows:

------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- ----

 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact
(in millions) At12/31/17 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Foreign currency rates $27 $49 $58 $27

 Fair Value Impact
(in millions) At12/31/17 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Interest rates $118 $150 $173 $118

 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact
(in millions) At12/31/16 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Foreign currency rates $63 $58 $87 $34

 Fair Value Impact
(in millions) At12/31/16 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Interest rates $143 $147 $217 $112

The value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions. The computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position.

Contingencies

See Item 3 and Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements
We may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as "strategy," "expects," "continues," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "will," "estimates," "intends," "projects," "goals," "targets" and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Business Environment of this section. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.

In connection with these elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we recognized a provisional expense of $1.6 billion, which was included as a component of income tax expense as follows:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A provisional charge of $1.4 billion, which represents the transition tax of $2.2 billion, net of a reversal of $0.7 billion of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities on part of the accumulated foreign earnings, and other items of $0.1 billion.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities using a rate of 21%, which, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is expected to be in place when such deferred assets and liabilities reverse in the future. In connection with this re-measurement, we recorded a provisional charge of $0.2 billion.

While the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced net earnings by $1.6 billion, there was no net impact on operating cash flows for the year, as the changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable offset the net earnings impact. At December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax payable of $1.7 billion representing the transition tax of $2.2 billion, partially offset by foreign tax credits related to foreign withholding taxes previously paid of $0.5 billion. The income tax payable is due over an 8-year period beginning in 2018. For further details, see Item 8, Note 11. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.

The change in the effective tax rate that decreased our diluted EPS by $0.03 per share in the table above was primarily due to earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.

Currency – The unfavorable currency impact during 2017 results from the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, especially against the Brazilian real, Egyptian pound, Euro, Japanese yen and Turkish lira, partially offset by the Russian ruble. This unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.

Interest – The favorable impact of interest was due primarily to higher interest income, partly offset by higher average debt levels.

Operations – The increase in diluted EPS of $0.47 from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Asia: Favorable volume/mix, higher pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Latin America & Canada: Higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix;

partially offset by

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• EEMA: Unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by higher pricing; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• European Union: Unfavorable volume/mix and higher marketing, administration and research costs, partially offset by higher pricing.

For further details, see the Consolidated Operating Results and Operating Results by Business Segment sections of the following Discussion and Analysis.

2018 Forecasted Results – On February 8, 2018, we announced our forecast for 2018 full-year reported diluted EPS to be in a range of $5.20 to $5.35, representing a projected increase of approximately 34% to 38% at prevailing exchange rates, versus $3.88 in 2017. Excluding a favorable currency impact, at then-prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.16 per share for the full-year 2018, the forecast range represents a projected increase of approximately 7% to 10% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.72 in 2017.

 18

This forecast assumes:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net revenue growth, excluding excise taxes, of over 8.0%, excluding currency;

- -----------------------------------------
• Operating cash flow of over $9.0 billion;

- -------------------------------------------------------
• Capital expenditures of approximately $1.7 billion; and

- ---------------------
• No share repurchases.

Following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our 2018 full-year diluted earnings per share forecast -- based on the current interpretation of the legislation -- assumes a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 28%, subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction. The difference between the 21% statutory rate under the new law and our effective rate reflects the fact that we operate in markets outside the United States and is driven by three main factors: foreign tax rate differences, non-deductibility of interest expense and a partial disallowance of foreign tax credits related to the application of the rules for global intangible low-taxed income.

We calculated 2017 adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS of $3.88, plus the $0.84 per share charge related to tax items. During 2017, we did not have an EPS impact related to asset impairment and exit costs.

Adjusted diluted EPS is not a measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("]:
NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Operations Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as a hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers ("VARs"), systems integrators ("SIs"), independent software vendors ("ISVs"), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") and Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). Basis of Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Com...

['s achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made. For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience. Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.

Employee Benefit Plans - As discussed in Item 8, Note 13. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements, we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries.

Weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows:

-------------------- ----- -----

 2017 2016
Pension plans 1.51% 1.52%
Postretirement plans 3.79% 3.68%

We anticipate that assumption changes will decrease 2018 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $164 million as compared with approximately $199 million in 2017, excluding amounts related to early retirement programs. The anticipated decrease is primarily due to higher expected return on assets of $21 million, coupled with lower amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for prior service cost of $12 million and unrecognized actuarial gains/losses of $10 million, partially offset by other movements of $8 million.

Weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans.  A fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2018 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $38 million, and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2018 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $54 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis-point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our 2018 pension expense by approximately $45 million. See Item 8, Note 13. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements for a sensitivity discussion of the assumed health care cost trend rates.

 20

Income Taxes - Income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the United States, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.

The extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes, we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.

The effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our full-year geographic earnings mix projections. Changes in currency exchange rates or earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the effective tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.

For further details, see Item 8, Note 11. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.

Hedging - As discussed below in “Market Risk,” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. For derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting, gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results. If we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions, gains (losses) deferred in stockholders’ (deficit) equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives.

Contingencies - As discussed in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. We and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the pending tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it: (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.

Net revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, net of sales and promotion incentives. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of our cigarettes and other tobacco products combined. Other tobacco products primarily include roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos and do not include reduced-risk products.

Net revenues related to reduced-risk products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, net of sales and promotion incentives. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of our heated tobacco units, IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, which primarily include our e-vapor products.

Net revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, increased by $3.1 billion. Excluding excise taxes, net revenues increased by $2.1 billion, due to:

- ----------------------------------
• price increases ($1.4 billion) and

- -----------------------------------------------------
• favorable volume/mix ($1.1 billion), partly offset by

• unfavorable currency ($437 million).

The unfavorable currency was due primarily to the Argentine peso, Egyptian pound, Japanese yen, Philippine peso and Turkish lira, partially offset by the Russian ruble.

Net revenues include $3.8 billion in 2017 and $739 million in 2016 related to the sale of RRPs, mainly driven by Japan. These net revenue amounts include excise taxes billed to customers. Excluding excise taxes, net revenues for RRPs were $3.6 billion in 2017 and $733 million in 2016. In some jurisdictions, including Japan, we are not responsible for collecting excise taxes. In 2017, approximately $0.9 billion of our $3.6 billion in RRP net revenues, excluding excise taxes, were from IQOS devices and accessories.

Excise taxes on products increased by $1.1 billion, due to:

Interest expense, net, of $914 million increased by $23 million, due primarily to unfavorably currency and higher average debt levels, partly offset by higher interest income.

Our effective tax rate increased by 12.8 percentage points to 40.7%. The 2017 effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by $1.6 billion due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For further details, see Item 8, Note 11. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements. We are continuing to evaluate the impact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have on our tax liability. Based upon our current interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we estimate that our 2018 effective tax rate will be approximately 28%, subject to future regulatory developments and earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction.

We are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world, and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties. An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.

Net earnings attributable to PMI of $6.0 billion decreased by $932 million (13.4%). This decrease was due primarily to a higher effective tax rate as discussed above, partly offset by higher operating income. Diluted and basic EPS of $3.88 decreased by 13.4%. Excluding

[") than found in cigarette smoke.

For smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke, we believe that RRPs offer a much better consumer choice. Accordingly, our key strategic priorities are: to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those products.

We recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to RRPs will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control, such as the willingness of governments, regulators and other policy groups to embrace RRPs as a desired alternative to continued cigarette smoking. We also recognize that our part in this transformation must be funded from our existing cigarette business. For as long as a significant number of adult smokers continues to smoke, it is critical that the industry be led by responsible and ethical manufacturers. Therefore, during the transformation, we intend to remain a leading international cigarette manufacturer.

We have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. We conduct rigorous scientific assessments of our RRP platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to HPHCs and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking. We draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our RRPs. Our efforts are guided by the following key objectives:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to develop RRPs that adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke find to be satisfying alternatives to smoking;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• for those adult smokers, our goal is to offer RRPs with a scientifically substantiated risk-reduction profile that approaches as closely as possible that associated with smoking cessation;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to substantiate the reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker and the reduction of harm to the population as a whole, based on scientific evidence of the highest standard that is made available for scrutiny and review by external independent scientists and relevant regulatory bodies; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs, including the communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices.

Our RRP Platforms: Our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation, which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke. We recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers. Therefore, we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences.

Four RRP platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness:

         Platform 1 uses a precisely controlled heating device that we are commercializing under the IQOS brand name, into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. We have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform, the results of which were included in our submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) described below. As anticipated, the results of the first six-month term of the 6+6 month exposure response study were received at the

 32

end of 2017, and the related report is under preparation. We expect to submit the final report for these results to the FDA in May of 2018. We expect to receive the results of the second six-month term of the study for analysis in the second quarter of 2018.

     Platform 2 uses a pressed carbon heat source which, when ignited, generates an aerosol by heating tobacco. The results of our pharmacokinetic study (that measured the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile and subjective effects) and of our five-day reduced exposure study with Platform 2 indicate that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who seek an alternative to cigarettes. Furthermore, the reduced exposure study showed a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs in those who switched to Platform 2 compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a five-day period. The sustainability of this reduction as well as changes in clinical risk markers were assessed in a 3-month reduced exposure study. As anticipated, the results of this study were received at the end of 2017, and the related report is under preparation. We expect the report to be finalized in the second quarter of 2018. Subsequently, in accordance with standard scientific practices, we intend to share the conclusions in scientific forums and to submit them for inclusion in peer-reviewed publications.

     Platform 3 provides an aerosol of nicotine salt formed by the chemical reaction of nicotine with a weak organic acid. We have explored two routes for this platform, one with electronics and one without, and have initiated a new nicotine pharmacokinetic study. We expect to receive the results for analysis in the second quarter of 2018.

     Platform 4 covers e-vapor products, which are battery-powered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a nicotine-containing liquid solution. Our e-vapor products comprise devices using current generation technology, and we are well advanced in the development and commercialization of our new e-vapor mesh technology that addresses certain challenges presented by some e-vapor products currently on the market. Our MESH products are designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol. We have initiated a nicotine pharmacokinetic study for which we expect to receive the results for analysis in the second quarter of 2018; the results of this study are expected to contribute to further developments of Platform 4 products.

Commercialization of RRPs: We are building a new product category and tailor our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market. We focus our commercialization efforts on retail experience, guided consumer trials and customer care, as well as digital communication programs.  In order to accelerate switching to IQOS, our initial market introductions typically entail one-on-one consumer engagement and introductory device discounts.  These initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment.

In 2014, we introduced the IQOS system in pilot city launches in Nagoya, Japan, and in Milan, Italy. Since then, we have expanded our commercialization activities to include all of Japan, as well as multiple cities in Italy. To date, IQOS is available for sale in key cities in 37 markets and nationwide in Japan.

On the basis of our experience in Japan and Italy, we estimate that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to IQOS switch back to cigarettes.

In the first quarter of 2016, we started the large scale commercial production of heated tobacco units. During 2017, we experienced supply shortages resulting from stronger-than-anticipated demand, primarily in Japan. Currently, we are no longer experiencing capacity limitations. We are integrating the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities and progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other RRP platforms.

In 2017, we secured a second supplier of IQOS devices. We are no longer experiencing supply constraints on the IQOS devices and, based on demand forecasts, we expect to be able to fully supply our current and planned launch markets with such devices.

The adequate supply chain for our RRP portfolio, including the supply of electronic devices, is important to our business. We work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our IQOS devices and a small number of other providers for other products in our RRP portfolio and related accessories. Although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health, the commercialization of our RRPs could be adversely affected if they are unable to meet their commitments. The production of our RRP portfolio requires various metals, and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements. However, some components and materials necessary for the production of our RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. Our inability to secure an adequate supply of such components and materials could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs.

Our IQOS devices are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law. We discuss product warranties in more detail in Note 5. Product Warranty. The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors including warranty policies and product failure rates and may increase with the number of devices sold.

 33

To further improve the consumer experience, we introduced a new version of the IQOS device in the first quarter of 2017 and continue to develop product improvements.

We are also progressing with our commercialization efforts for the other platforms:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We currently market our e-vapor products in several markets, including Ireland, Israel, Spain and the U.K. A city test of MESH, one of our Platform 4 products, is ongoing in Birmingham, U.K., and we expect to initiate a pilot launch of a next-generation version of this product in 2018.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In December 2017, we initiated a small-scale city test of TEEPS, our Platform 2 product, in Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we plan to conduct a consumer test of our Platform 3 product.

RRP Regulation and Taxation: RRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. We therefore support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs. Regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. Regulation should provide minimum standards for RRPs and specific rules for product assessment methodologies, ingredients, labelling and consumer communication, and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and non-combustible tobacco and nicotine-containing products. Regulation, as well as tobacco industry activities, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.

Some governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs. These regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke. We oppose such blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking. By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.

In the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing “Modified Risk Tobacco Products” and “New Tobacco Products” exists under the jurisdiction of the FDA. We submitted to the FDA a Modified Risk Tobacco Product Application (“MRTPA”) for IQOS in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (“PMTA”) for IQOS in March 2017. In May 2017, the FDA formally accepted and filed our MRTPA for substantive scientific review and, in June 2017, the FDA opened the period for the public to provide comments on our application. In August 2017, the FDA completed a preliminary review of our PMTA and accepted our application for substantive review. The FDA referred our MRTPA to the Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee (“TPSAC”). TPSAC held a meeting on January 24 and January 25, 2018 on our MRTPA. The recommendations and votes of TPSAC are not binding on the FDA. By regulation, the FDA’s decision on our MRTPA will take into account, in addition to the views of TPSAC, scientific evidence as well as comments, data and information submitted by interested persons.

Separately, on July 28, 2017, the FDA issued a policy announcement aiming to explore the potential of nicotine reduction in cigarettes in conjunction with less harmful products that deliver nicotine for adults who choose to use such products.

Future FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.

In the EU, all EU Member States and Norway have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated tobacco units, and e-cigarettes. Most of the EU Member States require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of a novel tobacco product, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products. To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of IQOS in 22 Member States.

On December 12, 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heated tobacco products relative to cigarette smoking. This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two heated tobacco products, one of which was IQOS. The assessment concluded that, while still harmful to health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heated tobacco products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, on February 6, 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heated tobacco products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.

 34

We make our scientific findings publicly available for scrutiny and peer review through several channels, including our websites. From time to time, adult consumers, competitors, members of the scientific community, and others inquire into our scientific methodologies, challenge our scientific conclusions or request further study of certain aspects of our RRPs and their health effects. We are committed to a robust and open scientific debate but believe that such debate should be based on accurate and reliable scientific information. We seek to provide accurate and reliable scientific information about our RRPs; nonetheless, we may not be able to prevent third-party dissemination of false, misleading or unsubstantiated information about these products.

To date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our RRPs are not cigarettes, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Although we believe that this is sensible from the public health perspective, we cannot guarantee that regulators will continue this approach.

There can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with RRPs or that regulation will allow us to commercialize RRPs in all markets, to communicate scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims, or to treat RRPs differently from cigarettes.

Our RRP Business Development Initiatives: In December 2013, we established a strategic framework with Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) under which Altria will make available its e-vapor products exclusively to us for commercialization outside the United States, and we will make available two of our RRPs exclusively to Altria for commercialization in the United States. In March 2015, we launched Solaris, a Platform 4 e-vapor product licensed from Altria, in Spain. In December 2015, we introduced Solaris in Israel.

In July 2015, we extended the strategic framework with Altria to include a Joint Research, Development and Technology Sharing Agreement. The additional agreement provides the framework under which PMI and Altria will collaborate to develop the next generation of e-vapor products for commercialization in the United States by Altria and in markets outside the United States by PMI. The collaboration between PMI and Altria in this endeavor is enabled by exclusive technology cross licenses and technical information sharing. The agreements also provide for cooperation on the scientific assessment of, and for the sharing of improvements to, the existing generation of licensed products.

Other Developments: On September 12, 2017, we announced our support of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. We agreed to contribute $80 million per year over the next 12 years, as specified in the agreement. We made an initial contribution of $4.5 million in 2017 and the first annual contribution of $80 million in the beginning of 2018. The Foundation is an independent body and is governed by its independent Board of Directors. The Foundation’s role, as set out in its corporate charter, includes funding research in the field of tobacco harm reduction, encouraging measures that reduce the harm caused by smoking, and assessing the effect of reduced cigarette consumption on the industry value chain.

Governmental Investigations

From time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters. We describe certain matters pending in Thailand and South Korea in Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies.

In November 2010, a WTO panel issued its decision in a dispute relating to facts that arose from August 2006 between the Philippines and Thailand concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by PM Thailand into Thailand (see Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies for additional information). The WTO panel decision, which was upheld by the WTO Appellate Body, concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand']:

Financial Review

Ÿ Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $8.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased by $0.8 billion from the comparable 2016 period. While the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced net earnings by $1.6 billion, there was no net impact on operating cash flows for the year, as the changes in deferred taxes and income taxes payable offset the net earnings impact. Excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as favorable currency movements of $0.4 billion, the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities can be attributed to higher net earnings offset by working capital and other movements.

At December 31, 2017, PMI recorded an income tax payable of $1.7 billion representing the transition tax of $2.2 billion, partially offset by foreign tax credits related to foreign withholding taxes previously paid of $0.5 billion. The income tax payable is due over an 8-year period beginning in 2018. For further details, see Item 8, Note 11. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $8.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $212 million from the comparable 2015 period. Excluding unfavorable currency movements of $409 million, the change was due primarily to net earnings growth and lower cash payments related to exit costs, partly offset by higher working capital requirements and 2016 installment payments of security into a court trust pertaining to the Létourneau and Blais cases as well as a 2016 payment to the South Korean tax authorities (see Item 8, Note 18. Contingencies for additional information).
Excluding currency, the unfavorable variance in working capital was due primarily to the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• more cash used for accounts receivable, primarily due to the timing of sales and cash collections (including unfavorable comparisons to the cash flows provided for accounts receivable in 2015 following the expansion of arrangements to sell accounts receivable to unaffiliated financial institutions as disclosed in Item 8, Note 20. Sale of Accounts Receivable), partly offset by

This increase in net cash used of $2.0 billion was due principally to cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets following the strengthening of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar, and higher capital expenditures. For further details on our derivatives designated as net investment hedges, see Item 8, Note 15. Financial Instruments.

Net cash used in investing activities of $968 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $260 million from the comparable 2015 period, due primarily to higher capital expenditures.

Our capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in 2017, $1.2 billion in 2016 and $1.0 billion in 2015. The 2017 expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in RRPs to support capacity expansion (notably for heated tobacco units). We expect total capital expenditures in 2018 of approximately $1.7 billion (including additional capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in RRPs to support capacity expansion), to be funded by operating cash flows.

Ÿ Net Cash Used in Financing Activities

During 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $2.8 billion, compared with net cash used in financing activities of $5.4 billion during 2016 and $4.7 billion in 2015.

The 2017 change was due primarily to higher proceeds from long-term debt issuances (primarily the $6.9 billion proceeds in 2017 from our U.S. dollar and Euro debt issuances versus the $3.5 billion proceeds in 2016 from our U.S. dollar and Euro debt issuances).

The 2016 change was due primarily to lower net proceeds received from the sale of subsidiary shares to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by higher proceeds from long-term debt issuances. For further details on the proceeds from the sale of subsidiary shares in 2015, see Item 8, Note 6. Acquisitions and Other Business Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements.

Dividends paid in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $6.5 billion, $6.4 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.

Ÿ Debt and Liquidity

We define cash and cash equivalents as short-term, highly liquid investments, readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes. As a policy, we do not hold any investments in structured or equity-linked products. Our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in demand deposits with institutions that have investment-grade long-term credit rating. As part of our cash management strategy and in order to manage counterparty exposure, we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements. Such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and, at maturity, cash is paid back to PMI and the collateral is returned to the bank. While we entered into these agreements during the periods and had an average balance during 2017 and 2016 of $0.9 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, we had a zero balance both at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
We utilize long-term and short-term debt financing, including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements, as part of our overall cash management strategy. Our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs. We expect that the combination of our long-term and short-term debt financing, the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities, coupled with our operating cash flows, will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements.

Credit Ratings – The cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings. At February 9, 2018, our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows:

----------------- ---------- --------- --------

 Short-term Long-term Outlook
Moody’s P-1 A2 Stable
Standard & Poor’s A-1 A Negative
Fitch F1 A Negative

Credit Facilities – On January 29, 2018, we entered into an agreement to extend the term of our $2.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility from February 6, 2018, to February 5, 2019. On August 29, 2017, we entered into an agreement, effective October 1, 2017, to

 63

extend the term of our $3.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period October 1, 2021 to October 1, 2022.

At February 9, 2018, our committed credit facilities were as follows:

------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ---

(in billions)
Type CommittedCreditFacilities
364-day revolving credit, expiring February 5, 2019 $ 2.0
Multi-year revolving credit, expiring February 28, 2021 2.5
Multi-year revolving credit, expiring October 1, 2022 3.5
Total facilities $ 8.0

At February 9, 2018, there were no borrowings under the committed credit facilities, and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing.

All banks participating in our committed credit facilities have an investment-grade long-term credit rating from the credit rating agencies. We continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group, and at this time we are not aware of any potential non-performing credit provider.

Each of these facilities requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“consolidated EBITDA”) to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1.0 on a rolling four-quarter basis. At December 31, 2017, our ratio calculated in accordance with the agreements was 10.6 to 1.0. These facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral. We expect to continue to meet our covenants. The terms “consolidated EBITDA” and “consolidated interest expense,” both of which include certain adjustments, are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above, certain of our subsidiaries maintain short-term credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs. These credit arrangements, which amounted to approximately $2.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2016, are for the sole use of our subsidiaries. Borrowings under these arrangements amounted to $499 million at December 31, 2017, and $643 million at December 31, 2016.

Commercial Paper Program – We continue to have access to liquidity in the commercial paper market through programs in place in the U.S. and in Europe having an aggregate issuance capacity of $8.0 billion. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had no commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper balance outstanding during 2017 and 2016 was $5.2 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.

Sale of Accounts Receivable – To mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions. These arrangements allow us to sell, on an ongoing basis, certain trade receivables without recourse. The trade receivables sold are generally short-term in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets. We sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements, servicing and nonservicing.

Our operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets, which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions. The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $1,092 million, $729 million and $888 million, respectively. The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

For further details, see Item 8, Note 20. Sale of Accounts Receivable to our consolidated financial statements.

Debt – Our total debt was $34.3 billion at December 31, 2017, and $29.1 billion at December 31, 2016. Our total debt is primarily fixed rate in nature. For further details, see Item 8, Note 7. Indebtedness. The weighted-average all-in financing cost of our total debt was 2.6% in 2017, compared to 2.8% in 2016. See Item 8, Note 16. Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our disclosures related to the fair value of debt. The amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.

On February 14, 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we may from time to time sell debt securities and/or warrants to purchase debt securities over a three-year period.
Our debt issuances in 2017 were as follows:

The net proceeds from the sale of the securities listed in the table above were used for general corporate purposes.

The weighted-average time to maturity of our long-term debt was 9.4 years at the end of 2017 and 10.6 years at the end of 2016.

• Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations discussed below.

Guarantees – At December 31, 2017, we were contingently liable for $0.9 billion of guarantees of our own performance, which were primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products. There is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees. At December 31, 2017, our third-party guarantees were insignificant.

 65

Aggregate Contractual Obligations – The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017:

------------------------------- ------ ------------ --------- --------- ------------------- ----- ------- ----- ------ -------

 Payments Due
(in millions) Total 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 2023 and Thereafter
Long-term debt (1) $34,120 $2,506 $8,221 $5,811 $17,582
Interest on borrowings (2) 11,131 981 1,656 1,372 7,122

Other long-term liabilities (5) 468 58 60 42 308
 $53,838 $7,857 $11,999 $8,201 $25,781

(1) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and capital lease obligations.
(2) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt. Interest on our fixed-rate debt is presented using the stated interest rate. Interest on our variable debt is estimated using the rate in effect at December 31, 2017. Amounts exclude the amortization of debt discounts, the amortization of loan fees and fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.
(3) Amounts represent the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases.
(4) Purchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services. Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Amounts represent the minimum commitments under non-cancelable contracts. Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.
(5) Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of postretirement health care costs and accruals established for employment costs. The following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension and postemployment costs, tax contingencies, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to estimate the timing of payments (or contributions in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. Currently, we anticipate making pension contributions of approximately $53 million in 2018, based on current tax and benefit laws (as discussed in Item 8, Note 13. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements).

Ÿ Equity and Dividends

We discuss our stock awards as of December 31, 2017, in Item 8, Note 9. Stock Plans to our consolidated financial statements.

During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program and we do not presently intend to repurchase shares of our common stock in 2018.

Dividends paid in 2017 were $6.5 billion. During the third quarter of 2017, our Board of Directors approved a 2.9% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.07 per common share. As a result, the present annualized dividend rate is $4.28 per common share.

Market Risk

Ÿ Counterparty Risk - We predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short- and long-term credit ratings as assigned by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. These banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks. Non-investment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs. We have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments. As such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equity-linked products. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested in demand deposits maturing within less than 30 days.

We continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties.

Ÿ Derivative Financial Instruments - We operate in markets outside of the U.S., with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world. Consequently, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure. We use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign

 66

exchange rates by creating offsetting exposures. We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

See Item 8, Note 15. Financial Instruments, Item 8, Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Item 8, Note 19. Balance Sheet Offsetting to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements.

Ÿ Value at Risk - We use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive financial instruments and to estimate the potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings of our foreign currency price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. This computation includes our debt, short-term investments, and foreign currency forwards, swaps and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.

The computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval. We use a “variance/co-variance” model to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies. These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at December 31, 2017 and 2016, and over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average value at risk amounts during each year. The values of foreign currency options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying currency and were valued accordingly in the computation.

The estimated potential one-day loss in fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive instruments, primarily debt, under normal market conditions and the estimated potential one-day loss in pre-tax earnings from foreign currency instruments under normal market conditions, as calculated in the value at risk model, were as follows:

------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- ----

 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact
(in millions) At12/31/17 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Foreign currency rates $27 $49 $58 $27

 Fair Value Impact
(in millions) At12/31/17 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Interest rates $118 $150 $173 $118

 Pre-Tax Earnings Impact
(in millions) At12/31/16 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Foreign currency rates $63 $58 $87 $34

 Fair Value Impact
(in millions) At12/31/16 Average High Low
Instruments sensitive to:
Interest rates $143 $147 $217 $112

The value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions. The computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position.
