Overview
We are a global provider of domain name registry services and internet security, enabling internet navigation for many of the world’s most recognized domain names and providing protection for websites and enterprises around the world. Our Registry Services ensure the security, stability and resiliency of key internet infrastructure and services, including the .com and .net domains, two of the internet’s root servers, and the operation of the root zone maintainer function for the core of the internet’s DNS. Our product suite also includes Security Services, consisting of DDoS Protection Services, and Managed DNS Services. Revenues from Security Services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues. On April 1, 2017, we completed the sale of our iDefense business.
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 146.4 million .com and .net registrations in the domain name base. The number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, which is partially driven by greater availability of internet access, as well as marketing activities carried out by us and third-party registrars. Growth in the number of domain name registrations under our management may be hindered by certain factors, including overall economic conditions, competition from ccTLDs, the introduction of new gTLDs, and ongoing changes in the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses. Factors such as the evolving practices and preferences of internet users, and how they navigate the internet, as well as the motivation of domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names, can negatively impact our business and the demand for new domain name registrations and renewals.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Management Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates those estimates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

 An accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. We believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements:

Revenue recognition
We generate revenues by providing services over a period of time. Fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs. The majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions. However, at times, we enter into non-standard arrangements including multiple-element arrangements. As a result, we must evaluate (1) whether an arrangement exists; (2) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables; (3) when to recognize revenue on the deliverables; and (4) whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. Our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured, which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers. As discussed in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K, the adoption of the new revenue guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue recognition when it becomes effective in 2018.
 Income taxes
Accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, the likelihood we would realize the benefits of carryforwards from net operating losses (“NOLs”), capital losses, domestic and/or foreign tax credits, the adequacy of valuation allowances, and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
Our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. The final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from U.S. federal, state, and international tax audits. We only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. We adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.
Due to the enactment of the Tax Act, we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. For further discussion of this change, see Note 10, “Income taxes” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
Earnings per Share
We use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our Subordinated Convertible Debentures on diluted earnings per share. Under this method, only a positive conversion spread related to the Subordinated Convertible Debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations. This is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the Subordinated Convertible Debentures in cash. A change in our intent and ability would require us to use the if-converted method, which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share.

Revenues
Revenues related to our Registry Services are primarily derived from registrations for domain names in the .com and .net domain name registries. We also derive revenues from operating domain name registries for several other TLDs and from providing back-end registry services to a number of TLD registry operators, all of which are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenues. For domain names registered with the .com and .net registries we receive a fee from registrars per annual registration that is fixed pursuant to our agreements with ICANN. Individual customers, called registrants, contract directly with registrars or their resellers, and the registrars in turn register the domain names with Verisign. Changes in revenues are driven largely by changes in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases, to the extent permitted by ICANN and the DOC. New registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising, e-commerce, and the number of internet users, as well as marketing activities carried out by us and our registrar customers. We increased the annual fee for a .net domain name registration from $6.79 to $7.46 on February 1, 2016, from $7.46 to $8.20 on February 1, 2017, and from $8.20 to $9.02 on February 1, 2018. We have the contractual right to increase the fees for .net domain name registrations by up to 10% each year during the term of our agreement with ICANN, through June 30, 2023. The annual fee for a .com domain name registration is $7.85 for the duration of the current .com Registry Agreement through November 30, 2024, except that prices may be raised by up to 7% each year due to the imposition of any new Consensus Policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the Security and Stability (each as defined in the .com Registry Agreement) of the DNS, subject to approval of the DOC. We offer promotional marketing programs for our registrars based upon market conditions and the business environment in which the registrars operate. All fees paid to us for .com and .net registrations are in U.S. dollars. Revenues from Security Services are not significant in relation to our total consolidated revenues.

The following table compares the domain name base for .com and .net managed by our Registry Services business:

---------------------------------- ------------------ ------------- ------- - ---- ------------- ------- - ---- -------------

 As of December 31,
 2017 %Change 2016 %Change 2015
Domain name base for .com and .net 146.4 million 3 % 142.2 million 2 % 139.8 million

2017 compared to 2016: Revenues increased by $22.9 million, primarily due to a 4% increase in the domain name base for .com and increases in the .net domain name registration fees in February 2016 and 2017, partially offset by a 5% decline in the domain name base for .net. Additionally, 2016 revenue was elevated due to an increased volume of new domain name registrations primarily from our registrars in China during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. The volume of these new registrations was inconsistent and episodic compared to prior periods, and by the end of the first quarter of 2016, reverted back to a more normalized registration pace. A significant portion of these registrations did not renew upon expiration.
2016 compared to 2015: Revenues increased by $82.8 million, primarily due to an increase in the average number of domain names ending in .com and .net and increases in the .net domain name registration fees in February 2015 and 2016. The increase in the average number of domain names ending in .com and .net was significantly impacted by the elevated volume of registrations from our registrars in China discussed above.
Growth in the domain name base has been primarily driven by continued internet growth and marketing activities carried out by us and our registrars. Competitive pressure from ccTLDs, the introduction of new gTLDs, ongoing changes in internet practices and behaviors of consumers and business, as well as the motivation of existing domain name registrants and how they will manage their investment in domain names, and historical global economic uncertainty, have limited the rate of growth of the domain name base in recent years and may continue to do so in 2018 and beyond. We expect revenues will continue to grow in 2018, as a result of the increased volume of domain registrations in 2017, continued growth in the domain name base in 2018, and increases in the .net domain name registration fees in February 2017 and 2018.
Geographic revenues
We generate revenue in the U.S.; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); China; and certain other countries, including Canada, Australia and Japan.
 The following table presents a comparison of the Company’s geographic revenues:

-------------- ----------------------- --------- ------- --- ---- - ------- - --------- -- -- - ------- - ---------

Total revenues $ 1,165,095 2 % $ 1,142,167 8 % $ 1,059,366

Revenues for our Registry Services business are attributed to the country of domicile and the respective regions in which our registrars are located, however, this may differ from the regions where the registrars operate or where registrants are located. Revenue growth for each region may be impacted by registrars reincorporating, relocating, or from acquisitions or changes in affiliations of resellers. Revenue growth for each region may also be impacted by registrars domiciled in one region, registering domain names in another region. These factors impacted revenues in China and the Other region during 2017. Additionally, while revenues grew in the U.S., EMEA and Other regions during 2017, revenues from China decreased. Revenues from China in 2016 benefited from the increased volume of registrations in the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, as discussed earlier. However, a significant portion of those registrations did not renew, resulting in the decline in revenues from China in 2017.

Cost of revenues

Cost of revenues consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits expenses for our personnel who manage the operational systems, depreciation expenses, operational costs associated with the delivery of our services, fees paid to ICANN, customer support and training, consulting and development services, costs of facilities and computer equipment used in these activities, telecommunications expense and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.
A comparison of cost of revenues is presented below:

---------------- ----------------------- ------- ------- ---- -- ------- - ------- - - - -------

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 %Change 2016 %Change 2015
 (Dollars in thousands)
Cost of revenues $ 193,326 (2 )% $ 198,242 3 % $ 192,788

2017 compared to 2016: Cost of revenues decreased by $4.9 million, primarily due to decreases in depreciation expenses and salary and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by an increase in telecommunications expenses. Depreciation expenses decreased by $5.3 million as a result of lower average hardware purchases over the last several years. Salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by $3.1 million, primarily due to a reduction in average headcount related to the sale of the iDefense business in April 2017, partially offset by increases in salary and employee benefits expenses for the remaining employee base. Telecommunications expenses increased by $3.2 million as a result of an increase in network costs supporting our operations.

2016 compared to 2015: Cost of revenues increased by $5.5 million, primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses, and allocated overhead expenses, partially offset by a decrease in telecommunications expenses. Salary and employee benefits expenses increased by $6.0 million, primarily due to an increase in average headcount and an increase in bonus expenses. Allocated overhead expenses increased by $1.5 million as a result of an increase in average headcount compared to other cost types. Telecommunications expenses decreased by $1.9 million, primarily due to savings on renewals of colocation agreements.
We expect cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to decrease slightly in 2018 as compared to 2017 as revenue is expected to grow faster than direct costs.
Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, sales commissions, sales operations and other personnel-related expenses, travel and related expenses, trade shows, costs of lead generation, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services, facilities costs, consulting fees, costs of marketing programs, such as online, television, radio, print and direct mail advertising costs, and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.

Sales and marketing $ 81,951 2 % $ 80,250 (11 )% $ 90,184

2017 compared to 2016: Sales and marketing expenses increased by $1.7 million, primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by a decrease in salary and employee benefits expenses. Advertising and marketing expenses increased by $7.0 million, primarily due to increases in costs related to certain marketing campaigns supporting our Registry Services business. Salary and employee benefits expenses decreased by $4.2 million due to a reduction in average headcount.

2016 compared to 2015: Sales and marketing expenses decreased by $9.9 million, primarily due to decreases in advertising and consulting expenses, salary and employee benefits expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, and allocated overhead expenses. Advertising and consulting expenses decreased by $3.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in marketing activities and advertising agency costs. Salary and employee benefits expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, decreased by $2.9 million due to a reduction in average headcount. Allocated overhead expenses decreased by $1.4 million due to the decrease in average headcount relative to other cost types.

32

We expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2018 as compared to 2017.
Research and development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel-related expenses, consulting fees, facilities costs, computer and communications equipment, support services used in our service and technology development, and allocations of indirect costs such as corporate overhead.
A comparison of research and development expenses is presented below:

------------------------ ----------------------- ------ ------- ---- -- ------- - ------ -- -- - ------

Research and development $ 52,342 (11 )% $ 59,100 (7 )% $ 63,718

2017 compared to 2016: Research and development expenses decreased by $6.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in salary and employee benefits expenses as a result of a reduction in average headcount.

2016 compared to 2015: Research and development expenses decreased by $4.6 million, primarily due to decreases in salary and employee benefits expenses, and allocated overhead costs, partially offset by a decrease in capitalized labor. Salary and employee benefits expenses, allocated overhead expenses, and capitalized labor decreased by $2.4 million, $1.7 million, and $1.5 million, respectively, due to a reduction in average headcount.

We expect research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2018 as compared to 2017.
General and administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance, information technology and human resources personnel, costs of facilities, computer and communications equipment, management information systems, support services, professional services fees, certain tax and license fees, and bad debt expense, offset by allocations of indirect costs such as facilities and shared services expenses to other cost types.

General and administrative $ 129,754 10 % $ 118,003 11 % $ 106,730

2017 compared to 2016: General and administrative expenses increased by $11.8 million, primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, legal expenses, and a decrease in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses. Salary and employee benefits expenses, including stock-based compensation expenses, increased by $4.9 million due to an increase in average headcount and higher projected achievement levels on certain performance-based restricted stock units (“RSU”) grants. Legal expenses increased by $4.5 million primarily due to higher external legal fees. Overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by $2.5 million due to an increase in the average headcount relative other cost types. Depreciation expenses decreased by $2.8 million as a result of a decrease in capital expenditures in recent years.

33

2016 compared to 2015: General and administrative expenses increased by $11.3 million, primarily due to increases in salary and employee benefits expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, legal expenses, and a decrease in overhead expenses allocated to other cost types, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expenses and certain non-income related taxes. Salary and employee benefits expenses increased by $8.0 million due to increases in bonus expenses and average headcount. Stock based compensation expenses increased by $4.5 million due to increases in the total value of RSUs granted in 2015 and 2016 and higher projected achievement levels on certain performance-based RSU grants. Legal expenses increased by $2.6 million primarily due to an increase in services performed by external legal counsel. Overhead expenses allocated to other cost types decreased by $1.6 million due to lower average headcount for other cost types. Depreciation expenses decreased by $2.6 million as a result of a decrease in capital expenditures in recent years. We incurred $2.1 million of certain non-income taxes in 2015, which did not recur in 2016.
We expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues to remain consistent in 2018 as compared to 2017.
Interest expense
See Note 4, “Debt and interest expense” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K. We expect interest expense to decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to a decrease in interest expense related to the Subordinated Convertible Debentures as we notified holders that the Subordinated Convertible Debentures will be redeemed on May 1, 2018, partially offset by an increase related to the senior notes issued in July 2017.
Non-operating income (loss), net
See Note 9, “Non-operating income (loss), net” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
Income tax expense

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
 (Dollars in thousands)
Income tax expense $ 141,764 $ 140,528 $ 112,414
Effective tax rate 24 % 24 % 23 %

Our effective tax rate for each year presented was lower than the statutory federal rate of 35% primarily due to benefits from foreign income taxed at lower rates, partially offset by state income taxes. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was also impacted by the changes arising out of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017.
Due to the change in tax law, we will owe U.S. federal taxes on our accumulated and future foreign earnings and as a result we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings. Our 2017 income tax expense includes a provisional $162.4 million of expense related to the U.S. tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a provisional $33.6 million deferred tax expense for foreign withholding tax on unremitted foreign earnings, both net of related, previously unrecognized foreign tax credits. These tax expenses are offset by a tax benefit of $186.8 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at the new U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 21% which became effective on January 1, 2018. We expect our effective tax rate to decrease slightly in 2018 as a result of the impact of the Tax Act. For further discussion of the Tax Act, see Note 10, “Income taxes” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2017, we had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $202.6 million, net of valuation allowances, but before the offset of certain deferred tax liabilities. With the exception of deferred tax assets related to capital loss and certain state NOL carryforwards, we believe it is more likely than not that the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, together with future taxable income, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets related to NOL carryforwards increased in 2017 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and the resulting recognition of $35.4 million of previously unrecognized excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Total deferred tax assets decreased in 2017 due to the usage of tax credit carryforwards to offset 2017 taxable income and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate.
We qualify for a tax holiday in Switzerland which does not expire, unless the required non-Swiss income and expense thresholds are no longer met, or there is a law change which eliminates the holiday. The tax holiday provides reduced rates of taxation on certain types of income and also requires certain thresholds of foreign source income. The tax holiday increased the Company’s earnings per share by $0.10, $0.16, and $0.14 in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Marketable securities 1,948,900 1,565,962
Total $ 2,414,751 $ 1,797,907

As of December 31, 2017, our principal source of liquidity was $465.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.9 billion of marketable securities. The marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital through investment in investment grade securities. The cash equivalents consist mainly of amounts invested in money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days. As of December 31, 2017, all of our debt securities have contractual maturities of less than one year. Our cash and cash equivalents are readily accessible. For additional information on our investment portfolio, see Note 2, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2017, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $1.7 billion. As a result of the recent changes in U.S. tax laws, we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and accordingly, we recognized a provisional income tax expense of $162.4 million related to the U.S. tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and a provisional $33.6 million related to withholding taxes on unremitted foreign earnings. By early second quarter of 2018, we intend to repatriate approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries, net of withholding taxes, based on current exchange rates.
In 2017, we repurchased 6.3 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $94.59 for an aggregate cost of $592.7 million under our share repurchase program. In 2016, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $81.73 for an aggregate cost of $636.5 million. In 2015, we repurchased 9.3 million shares of our common stock at an average stock price of $66.59 for an aggregate cost of $621.9 million. On February 8, 2018, our Board authorized the repurchase of approximately $585.8 million of our common stock, in addition to the $414.2 million of our common stock remaining available for repurchase under the previous share repurchase program, for a total repurchase authorization of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock.
On July 5, 2017, we issued $550.0 million of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2027. The proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repurchase of shares under our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2017, we also had $500.0 million principal amount outstanding of the 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2025 and $750.0 million principal amount outstanding of the 4.625% senior unsecured notes due 2023.
As of December 31, 2017, we have a $200.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with no borrowings outstanding. This facility will expire in 2020.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $1.25 billion principal amount outstanding of our Subordinated Convertible Debentures. The price of our common stock exceeded the conversion price threshold trigger during the fourth quarter of 2017. Accordingly, the Subordinated Convertible Debentures are convertible at the option of each holder through March 31, 2018.

We have historically derived significant tax savings from the Subordinated Convertible Debentures as the interest deduction for tax purposes has exceeded the cash interest paid due to the structure of the debentures and the related tax laws.  During 2017 and 2016, the interest deduction, for income tax purposes, related to our Subordinated Convertible Debentures, was $191.5 million and $183.7 million, respectively, compared to cash interest paid, including contingent interest, of $55.9 million and $54.0 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The size of the interest deduction for tax purposes resulted in a tax benefit that exceeded the cash interest paid for the debentures in each of these years. However, as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act, which includes limits on interest deductibility and a lower U.S. federal income tax rate, these tax savings are expected to diminish in the future. Due to the diminished tax savings and several other factors, on February 15, 2018 we called for the redemption of all the outstanding Subordinated Convertible Debentures, with a redemption date of May 1, 2018. If holders elect to convert their debentures, we will settle the $1.25 billion principal amount in cash and settle the remaining value through the issuance of shares of Verisign’s common stock. Based on the if-converted value of the Subordinated Convertible Debentures as of December 31, 2017, the conversion spread would have required us to issue up to 25.4 million shares of common stock.

We believe existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and funds generated from operations, together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure requirements, and to service our debt for the next 12 months. We regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs.
In summary, our cash flows for 2017, 2016, and 2015 were as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ------- ---- -------- ---- ------- -------- - - -------

 Year Ended December 31,
 2017 2016 2015
 (In thousands)
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 702,761 $ 693,007 $ 669,946
Net cash used in investing activities (405,076 ) (40,399 ) (496,899 )
Net cash used in financing activities (65,073 ) (648,821 ) (136,242 )
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1,294 (501 ) 246
Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 233,906 $ 3,286 $ 37,051

Net cash provided by operating activities

Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures, and other general operating expenses, as well as payments related to taxes, interest and facilities.

2017 compared to 2016: Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increases in cash received from customers and an increase in interest income, partially offset by increases in cash paid to suppliers and employees, cash paid for income taxes, and cash paid for interest on our debt obligations. Cash received from customers increased primarily due to higher .com domain name registrations and renewals and the increase in .net domain name registration fees in February 2017. Cash received from interest income increased due to increases in interest rates and our investments in debt securities. Cash paid to suppliers and employees increased primarily due to timing of certain vendor payments. Cash paid for income taxes increased due to higher non-U.S. income tax payments. Cash paid for interest increased due to higher contingent interest related to the Subordinated Convertible Debentures.

2016 compared to 2015: Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers and a decrease in cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest. Cash received from customers increased primarily due to an increase in the number of domain name registration renewals and the increase in .net domain name registration fees in February 2016. Cash paid for income taxes decreased primarily due to income tax payments in 2015 related to the reorganization of certain international operations. Cash paid for interest increased due to the interest paid on the $500.0 million senior notes issued on March 2015, and higher contingent interest related to the Subordinated Convertible Debentures.

Net cash used in investing activities

The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to purchases, maturities and sales of marketable securities, and purchases of property and equipment and rights to intangible assets.

2017 compared to 2016: The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, and an increase in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by the payments made in 2016 for the future assignment of the rights to the .web gTLD, and an increase in other investing activities including the proceeds received from the sale of our iDefense business.

2016 compared to 2015: The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities, net of purchases, and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment and other investing activities, partially offset by the payments made for the future assignment of the rights to the .web gTLD.

Net cash used in financing activities

The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases, proceeds from and repayment of borrowings, and our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”).

36

2017 compared to 2016: The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the proceeds received from the issuance of the 4.75% senior notes due 2027 in the third quarter of 2017, net of issuance costs, and a decrease in share repurchases.

2016 compared to 2015: The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases, and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in March 2015.

Impact of Inflation

We do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our operations in any of the periods presented.

Income taxes
As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, we will owe U.S. income tax on our foreign earnings and as a result, we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings. We expect the amount of cash paid for income taxes in 2018 to increase due to the foreign withholding taxes that will be paid related to funds repatriated to the U.S. and other impacts of the Tax Act.
Property and Equipment Expenditures

Our planned property and equipment expenditures for 2018 are anticipated to be between $45.0 million and $55.0 million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio.

Contractual Obligations

See Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies,” Purchase Obligations and Contractual Agreements, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

It is not our business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements. See Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies,” Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements.

Dilution from RSUs
Grants of stock-based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. We recognize that these stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages. As of December 31, 2017, there are a total of 1.6 million unvested RSUs which represent potential dilution of 1.6%. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding RSUs vest and are settled. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of RSU grants to employees; however, we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes.
