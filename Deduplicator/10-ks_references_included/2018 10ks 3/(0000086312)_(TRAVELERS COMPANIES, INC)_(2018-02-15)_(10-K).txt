Realignment of Reportable Business Segments

        Effective April 1, 2017, the Company's results are reported in the following three business segments—Business Insurance,
Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, reflecting a change in the manner in which the Company's businesses were being managed as of that date, as well as the aggregation of products
and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten. While the segmentation of the Company's domestic businesses was unchanged, the
Company's international businesses, which were previously managed and reported in total within the Business and International Insurance segment, were disaggregated by product type among the three
newly aligned reportable business segments. All prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. In connection with these changes, the Company revised the names and
descriptions of certain businesses comprising the Company's segments and has reflected other related changes. The following discussion of segment results is based on the realigned reportable business
segment structure effective April 1, 2017.

    The
following discussions of the Company's net income and segment income are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income and segment income are presented
on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.

Overview

        Diluted net income per share of $7.33 in 2017 decreased by 29% from diluted net income per share of $10.28 in 2016. Net income of
$2.06 billion in 2017 decreased by 32% from net income of $3.01 billion in 2016. The lower rate of decrease in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in
recent periods. The decrease in net income primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower net favorable prior year reserve
development, (iii) lower underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development ("underlying underwriting margins") and (iv) lower other income in 2017 due
to a favorable settlement of a reinsurance dispute in 2016, partially offset by (v) higher net realized investment gains and (vi) higher net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2017
and 2016 were $1.95 billion and $877 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 was $592 million and $771 million, respectively.
The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i) loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in

Business
Insurance, (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Personal Insurance, partially offset
by (iv) increased business volumes. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in income was a related decrease in income tax expense. Income tax expense also included a net charge of
$129 million to reflect the change in tax laws and tax rates enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), resulting primarily from
revaluing the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities and the tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings. In addition, income tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $39 million as a result
of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

    Diluted
net income per share of $10.28 in 2016 decreased by 6% from diluted net income per share of $10.88 in 2015. Net income of $3.01 billion in 2016 decreased by 12% from net
income of $3.44 billion in 2015. The lower rate of decrease in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The decrease in net income primarily
reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins, (iii) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and
(iv) lower net investment income, partially offset by (v) higher other revenues and (vi) higher net realized investment gains. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 were
$877 million and $514 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 was $771 million and $941 million, respectively. The lower
underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from (i) higher loss estimates in the personal automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages, (ii) the impact of loss
cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business Insurance and (iii) higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by (iv) lower non-catastrophe fire-related
losses and other loss activity in Business Insurance. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in income was a related decrease in income tax expense. Income tax expense in 2015 was also reduced
by $32 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

    The
Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd's, as well as in Brazil
and Colombia, primarily through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The
impact of these changes was not material to the Company's net income or segment income for the periods reported.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

        Earned premiums in 2017 were $25.68 billion, $1.15 billion or 5% higher than in 2016. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in
2017 increased by 2% over 2016. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in 2017 increased by 2% over 2016. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2017 increased by 10% over 2016.
Earned premiums in 2016 were $24.53 billion, $660 million or 3% higher than in 2015. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in 2016 increased by 1% over 2015. In Bond & Specialty
Insurance, earned premiums in 2016 were comparable to 2015. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2016 increased by 6% over 2015. Factors contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each
segment in 2017 and 2016 compared with the respective prior year are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

Net Investment Income

    The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's investments.

--------------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- - ------ - - ------ -

(1)Excludes
net unrealized investment gains and losses and reflects cash, receivables for investment sales, payables on investment purchases and accrued investment
income.

(2)Excludes
net realized and net unrealized investment gains and losses.

    Net
investment income in 2017 was $2.40 billion, $95 million or 4% higher than in 2016. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2017 was
$1.89 billion, $86 million lower than in 2016. The decrease primarily resulted from lower long-term reinvestment rates available in the market, partially offset by the impact of a
slightly higher average level of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2017 was $62 million, $33 million higher than in 2016, primarily due to
higher short-term interest rates and a higher average level of short-term investments. Net investment
income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2017 was $478 million, $148 million higher than in 2016, primarily due to higher returns from private equity limited partnerships.

    Net
investment income in 2016 was $2.30 billion, $77 million or 3% lower than in 2015. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2016 was
$1.98 billion, $110 million lower than in 2015. The decrease in net investment income from fixed maturity investments primarily resulted from lower long-term reinvestment rates available
in the market and a modestly lower amount of fixed income investments that were impacted by the Company's $524 million payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc.
litigation in the second quarter of 2016. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2016 was $29 million, $17 million higher than in 2015, primarily due to higher short-term
interest rates. Net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2016 was $330 million, $13 million higher than in 2015, primarily due to higher returns from private
equity limited partnerships, partially offset by lower returns from real estate partnerships.

Fee Income

    The National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business. Fee income is described in more
detail in the Business Insurance discussion that follows.

Net Realized Investment Gains

    The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's net pre-tax realized investment gains.

Other Net Realized Investment Gains

        Other net realized investment gains in 2017 included $236 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities,
$10 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales, $4 million of net realized gains related to fixed maturity investments and $20 million of net realized
investment losses related to other investments.

    Other
net realized investment gains in 2016 included $59 million of net realized gains related to fixed maturity investments, $14 million of net realized investment gains
related to equity securities, $7 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales and $17 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments.

related to equity securities, $2 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales and $34 million of net realized investment losses related to other investments. The net
realized investment losses related to other investments included $26 million of realized foreign exchange translation losses incurred in connection with the Company's increased ownership of
Travelers Participações em Seguros Brasil S.A.

Other Revenues

        Other revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges. Other revenues in 2017 also included revenues from Simply Business,
which was acquired in August 2017. Other revenues in 2017 and 2016 also included gains related to the settlement of reinsurance disputes (discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements). Other revenues in 2016 also included proceeds from the favorable settlement of a claims-related legal matter.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

        Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $17.47 billion, $2.40 billion or 16% higher than in 2016, primarily reflecting
the impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures, (iii) loss cost trends, (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve
development, (v) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and (vi) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Personal Insurance. Catastrophe losses in 2017
primarily
resulted from wildfires in California, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and several winter, wind and hail storms throughout the United States.

    Claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were $15.07 billion, $1.35 billion or 10% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher volumes of
insured exposures, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher catastrophe losses, (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (v) higher loss estimates in the
personal automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages, partially offset by (vi) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity in Business Insurance.
Catastrophe losses in 2016 primarily resulted from Hurricane Matthew, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States, flooding in the Southeast region of the United States, wildfires in
Canada and Tennessee, and winter storms in the eastern United States. Catastrophe losses in 2015 primarily resulted from wildfires in California, and several winter, wind and hail storms throughout
the United States.

    Factors
contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes
to the consolidated financial statements.

Significant Catastrophe Losses

    The Company defines a "catastrophe" as an event that:

• is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic
events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada; and

• the Company's estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold.

    The
Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the
other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an
aggregate threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2017 ranged from approximately $17 million to $30 million of losses before
reinsurance and taxes.

    The
following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2017, 2016 and 2015, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable)
prior year reserve development recognized in 2017 and 2016 for catastrophes that occurred in 2016 and 2015, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at December 31, 2017, 2016
and 2015. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

        Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $4.17 billion, $181 million or 5% higher than in 2016. Amortization of
deferred acquisition costs in 2016 was $3.99 billion,
$100 million or 3% higher than in 2015. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

General and Administrative Expenses

        General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $4.17 billion, comparable with 2016. General and administrative expenses in 2016 were
$4.15 billion, $60 million or 1% higher than in 2015. General and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

Interest Expense

        Interest expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $369 million, $363 million and $373 million, respectively.

Income Tax Expense

        Income tax expense in 2017 was $674 million, $365 million or 35% lower than in 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the
$1.32 billion decrease in income before income taxes in 2017 and the $39 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters, partially offset
by the net charge of $129 million as part of the TCJA described above. Income tax expense in 2016 was $1.04 billion, $262 million or 20% lower than in 2015, primarily reflecting
the impact of the $687 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2016.

    The
Company's effective tax rate was 25%, 26% and 27% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rates in all years were lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due
to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's income tax provision. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2017 was increased by the net charge related to TCJA
described above and was reduced by the impact of the resolution of prior year tax matters discussed above.

Combined Ratio

        The combined ratio of 97.9% in 2017 was 5.9 points higher than the combined ratio of 92.0% in 2016.

    The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.2% in 2017 was 6.7 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.5% in 2016. Catastrophe losses accounted for 7.6
points and 3.6 points of the 2017 and 2016 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 provided 2.3 points and 3.2 points of
benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding
catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development ("underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio") in 2017 was 1.8 points higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting
(i) loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business Insurance, (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and (iii) higher
non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Personal Insurance.

    The
underwriting expense ratio of 30.7% in 2017 was 0.8 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 31.5% in 2016.

    The
combined ratio of 92.0% in 2016 was 3.7 points higher than the combined ratio of 88.3% in 2015.

    The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.5% in 2016 was 3.9 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 56.6% in the same period of 2015. Catastrophe losses
accounted for 3.6 points and 2.1 points of the 2016 and 2015 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 provided 3.2 points
and 3.9 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2016 was 1.7 points higher than the 2015 ratio on the
same basis, primarily reflecting (i) higher loss estimates in the personal automobile product line for bodily injury liability

and (ii) the impact of loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business Insurance, partially offset by (iii) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and
other loss activity in Business Insurance.

    The
underwriting expense ratio of 31.5% was 0.2 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 31.7% in 2015.

Overview

        Segment income in 2017 was $1.61 billion, $369 million or 19% lower than segment income of $1.98 billion in 2016, primarily
reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower other income due to a favorable settlement of a reinsurance dispute in 2016 and
(iii) lower underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by (iv) higher net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 were $858 million and $463 million,
respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 was $439 million and $424 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted
from the impacts of (i) loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing and (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in
segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense. In addition, income tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $15 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

    Segment
income in 2016 was $1.98 billion, $95 million or 5% lower than segment income of $2.08 billion in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impacts of
(i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins and (iii) lower net investment income, partially offset by (iv) higher other revenues and
(v) higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 were $463 million and $245 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve
development in 2016 and 2015 was $424 million and $332 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from (i) the impact of loss cost trends
that modestly exceeded earned pricing and (ii) higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by (iii) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity.
Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

        Earned premiums of $14.15 billion in 2017 were $291 million or 2% higher than in 2016. Earned premiums of $13.86 billion in
2016 were $157 million or 1% higher than in 2015. The increase in earned premiums in both 2017 and 2016 reflected increases in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.

Net Investment Income

        Net investment income in 2017 was $1.79 billion, $85 million or 5% higher than in 2016. Net investment income in 2016 was

contributing to the changes in the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2017 and 2016 compared with the respective prior years. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology.

Fee Income

    National Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services to large
companies that choose to self-insure a portion of their insurance risks, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2017 was
$430 million, $12 million or 3% lower than in 2016, primarily reflecting lower serviced premium volume due to the depopulation of
workers' compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2016 was $442 million, $3 million or 1% lower than in 2015.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

        Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $9.52 billion, $768 million or 9% higher than in 2016, primarily reflecting the
impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher volumes of insured exposures and (iv) higher non-catastrophe fire-related
losses. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were $8.75 billion, $344 million or 4% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) loss cost trends and
(ii) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (iii) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity.

development
in 2017 and 2016 was $140 million and $350 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in both 2017 and 2016 were $6 million. The lower underlying underwriting margins
primarily reflected a higher level of international surety losses. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense. In addition, income
tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $17 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

    Segment
income in 2016 was $712 million, $29 million or 4% higher than segment income of $683 million in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impact of
(i) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (ii) lower net investment income. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 was
$350 million and $281 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 were $6 million and $3 million, respectively. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax
increase in segment income was a related increase in income tax expense.

Overview

        Segment income in 2017 was $128 million, $389 million or 75% lower than segment income of $517 million in 2016, primarily
reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (ii) higher net investment income, (iii) higher underlying underwriting margins
and (iv) net favorable prior year reserve development as compared to net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 were $1.09 billion and
$408 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 was $13 million, compared with net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $3 million in
2016. The higher underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i) increased business volumes and (ii) earned pricing that modestly exceeded loss cost trends,
partially offset by (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense. In
addition, income tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $7 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

    Segment
income in 2016 was $517 million, $415 million or 45% lower than segment income of $932 million in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impacts of
(i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development as compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015, (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins and (iii) higher
catastrophe losses. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016 was $3 million, compared with net favorable prior year reserve development of $328 million in 2015. Catastrophe
losses in 2016 and 2015 were $408 million and $266 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from higher loss estimates in the Automobile
product line for bodily injury liability coverages. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

        Earned premiums in 2017 were $9.23 billion, $811 million or 10% higher than in 2016. Earned premiums in 2016 were

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

        Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $7.05 billion, $1.36 billion or 24% higher than in 2016, primarily reflecting
the impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures, (iii) loss cost trends and (iv) higher non-catastrophe weather-related
losses, partially offset by (v) net favorable prior year reserve development as compared with net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in
2016 were $5.68 billion, $1.09 billion or 24% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting (i) higher volumes of insured exposures, (ii) net unfavorable prior year reserve
development as compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015, (iii) higher catastrophe losses, (iv) higher loss estimates in the Automobile product line for bodily
injury liability coverages and (v) the impact of loss cost trends.

    Net
prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 was not significant. Factors contributing to prior year reserve development during the year ended December 31, 2015 are
discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

        Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $1.45 billion, $105 million or 8% higher than in 2016. Amortization of
deferred acquisition costs in 2016 was $1.34 billion, $58 million or 5% higher than in 2015. The increases in both 2017 and 2016 were generally consistent with the increases in earned
premiums.

General and Administrative Expenses

        General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $1.11 billion, $13 million or 1% lower than in 2016. General and administrative
expenses of $1.12 billion in 2016 were comparable with 2015.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

        The income tax benefit in 2017 was $(44) million, compared with income tax expense of $192 million in 2016, primarily reflecting the
impact of the $625 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2017, and the $7 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters.
Income tax expense in 2016 was $192 million, $224 million or 54% lower than in 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of the $639 million decrease in income before income taxes in
2016. The level of income tax expense (benefit) in all years reflected the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's tax provision.

Combined Ratio

        The combined ratio of 103.1% in 2017 was 7.3 points higher than the combined ratio of 95.8% in 2016.

    The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 76.3% in 2017 was 8.8 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.5% in 2016. Catastrophe losses accounted for 11.7
points and 4.9 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 provided 0.1 points of benefit to the loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016 had no impact on the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
in 2017 was 2.1 points higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (ii) the tenure impact of
higher levels of new business in recent years in the Automobile product line and (iii) a higher level of automobile business relative to homeowners and other business, partially offset by
(iv) earned pricing that modestly exceeded loss cost trends.

    The
underwriting expense ratio of 26.8% in 2017 was 1.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 28.3% in 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of higher levels of earned
premiums.

    The
combined ratio of 95.8% in 2016 was 8.4 points higher than the combined ratio of 87.4% in 2015.

    The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.5% in 2016 was 9.4 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 58.1% in 2015. Net unfavorable prior year reserve
development in 2016 had no impact on the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 4.2 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio in 2015. Catastrophe losses accounted for 4.9 points and 3.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio in 2016 was 3.7 points higher than the 2015 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting (i) higher loss estimates in the Automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages,
(ii) the tenure impact of higher levels of new business in recent years in the Automobile product line and (iii) a higher level of automobile business relative to homeowners and other
business.

    The
underwriting expense ratio of 28.3% in 2016 was 1.0 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.3% in 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of higher levels of earned
premiums.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

    The Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded
insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the
Company's policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy). Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants
and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of
traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. In addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility
of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the Company. The bankruptcy of many
traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who
allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease
manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not
traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company's asbestos-related claims and
claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or
through the insolvency of other participating insurers.

    The
Company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or
a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. In these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated
as a separate occurrence under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. To the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor
and other Company defenses are not successful, the Company's coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and
the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the
ultimate cost of these claims.

    Many
coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of
settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than
originally anticipated. There also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed

95

Table of Contents

settlement,
which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the Company. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.

    In
addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to
the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) had previously entered into
settlement agreements in connection with a number of these direct action claims (Direct Action Settlements). The Company had been involved in litigation concerning whether all of the conditions of the
Direct Action Settlements had been satisfied. On July 22, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that all of the conditions of the Direct Action Settlements had
been satisfied. On January 15, 2015, the bankruptcy court entered an order directing the Company to pay $579 million to the plaintiffs, comprised of the $502 million settlement
amounts, plus pre- and post-judgment interest of $77 million, which the Company paid in 2015. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company,
could be made in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal
theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.

    On
January 29, 2009, the Company and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), along with approximately 30 other insurers of PPG, agreed in principle to settle asbestos-related coverage
litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG (the "Agreement"). The Agreement was incorporated into the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization ("Amended Plan") proposed as part of the
Pittsburgh Corning Corp. (PCC, which is 50% owned by PPG) bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to the Amended Plan, which was filed on January 30, 2009, PCC, along with enumerated other companies
(including PPG as well as the Company as a participating insurer), receive protections afforded by Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code from certain asbestos-related bodily injury claims.
Under the Agreement, the Company had the option to make a series of payments over 20 years totaling approximately $620 million to the trust created under the Amended Plan, or it could
elect to make a discounted payment. On January 7, 2016, the remaining objections to the Amended Plan were dismissed. On April 27, 2016, the Amended Plan became effective and all the
remaining conditions to the Agreement were satisfied. The Company fully satisfied its obligation under the Agreement by making a discounted payment in the second quarter of 2016. The Company's payment
totaled $524 million, of which $518 million was related to asbestos reserves. The Company's obligations under the Agreement were included in its claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves at December 31, 2015.

    Because
each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors
which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits
and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future
claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of
non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos
claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.

96

Table of Contents

    In
the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and
"non-product" liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:

• a high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness, primarily
involving mesothelioma claims;

• while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to a high level
of litigation activity; and

• a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.

    In
the Home Office and Field Office category, which accounts for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, the number of policyholders tendering asbestos
claims for the first time and the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims declined slightly when compared to 2016 while gross asbestos-related payments were higher. Payments on behalf of
policyholders in this category continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury,
primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.

    The
Company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the Home Office and Field Office, and Assumed Reinsurance and Other
categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any
emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves and the Company's evaluations
have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.

    The
completion of these reviews and analyses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted in $225 million, $225 million and $224 million increases, respectively, in the Company's
net asbestos reserves. In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of
policyholders in the Home Office category due to a higher than previously anticipated level of litigation activity surrounding mesothelioma claims. This increase in the estimate of projected
settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. Over the past
decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes
that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by
exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained
in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company's overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment
is essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.

    The
Policyholders with Settlement Agreements category includes structured settlements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to TPC, Wellington accounts (as discussed below).
Reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Structured
settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times. Coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with
policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. Payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. Wellington accounts refer to the
35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. Many of the aspects of the Wellington agreement are similar to
those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. In 2016, the Company paid the
$518 million settlement related to asbestos-related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG, as described above.

    The
Home Office and Field Office category relates to all other policyholders and also includes IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation.
IBNR reserves in the Home Office and Field Office category include amounts for new claims and adverse development on existing Home Office and Field Office policyholders, as well as reserves for claims
from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. Policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based
upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims,
products/completed operations and potential "non-product" exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. The Assumed Reinsurance and
Other category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.

    Net
asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $271 million, $708 million and $770 million, respectively. Net payments in 2016 included the
$458 million payment related to the PPG settlement, as described above. Net payments in 2015 included the $502 million payment related to the Direct Action Settlements as described
above. Approximately 4%, 69% and 69% of total net paid losses in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the
Company's liability.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

    The Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of
their alleged disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of
hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA
may be joint and several with other responsible parties.

    The
Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions
have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company
prior to the mid-1980s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought
by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.

    The
resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any

99

Table of Contents

obligations
it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder.
This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a "buy-back" of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation
which the Company may have for other claims, including, but not limited to, asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which
extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. Where appropriate, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company's
general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related
costs.

    In
establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis,
the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature
of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the
corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between
the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other
available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential
non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. The evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that
policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. Conventional actuarial methods are not used to estimate these reserves.

    In
its review of environmental reserves, the Company considers: past settlement payments; changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental
coverage matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for both on-and off-site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse development;
the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements.

    The
duration of the Company's investigation and review of these claims and the time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the Company vary
significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying
litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the Company and the willingness of the policyholder and the Company to negotiate, if appropriate, a
resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. Because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the Company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration
of an environmental claim. However, based upon the Company's experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years.

    The
Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These policyholders continue to
present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based
site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental
claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less
than anticipated. In addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims has been greater than anticipated,

driven
by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these factors, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by
$65 million, $82 million and $72 million, respectively.

    Net
environmental paid loss and loss expenses were $88 million, $61 million and $55 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017,
approximately 94% of the net environmental reserve
(approximately $340 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage
litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the Company's
experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 6% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $20 million), consists of case reserves.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

    As a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims
are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult
to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims
develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various
asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the
emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than

101

Table of Contents

anticipated
as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the Company has issued, the resolution or
adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the Company's previous assessment of these claims, the
number and outcome of direct actions against the Company, future developments pertaining to the Company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of
other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. In addition, uncertainties arise
from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future
development of asbestos and environmental claims. This environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the
outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex
coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case
with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of
asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.

    Because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company's current insurance reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of
claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement
charges that could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

        The Company's invested assets at December 31, 2017 were $72.50 billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term
investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 5% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company
employs a conservative investment philosophy. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government,
tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.

    The
carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2017 was $62.69 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity
investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company's insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit
quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was "Aa2" at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. Below investment grade securities
represented 2.7% and 2.9% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and
short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2017 and 4.2 (4.5 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2016.

Obligations of States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions

        The Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $30.92 billion and $31.91 billion,
respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is
diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar
issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $3.90 billion and $5.16 billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for
which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities.
These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the
underwriter, issuer or trustee. All of the Company's holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have been pre-refunded and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities.

have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated "A-1+" and/or "P-1," are included as "Aaa"
rated securities.

    In
addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling $153 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships
(both of which are included in other investments in the Company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling
$134 million to these partnerships. The Company has no non-redeemable preferred stock issued by companies in the Eurozone.

Mortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities

        The Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $2.41 billion and $1.71 billion,
respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either
shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company's
investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA
or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments
from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of
bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees,

107

Table of Contents

from
credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company's investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable
return given the Company's assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests
in CMOs. For more information regarding the Company's investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Alternative Documentation Mortgages and Sub-Prime Mortgages

        At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio included CMOs backed by alternative documentation
mortgages and asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $111 million and $142 million, respectively (comprising less than 1% of the
Company's total fixed maturity investments at both dates). The Company defines sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the
following characteristics: low FICO scores, above-prime interest rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. Alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the
underlying loans primarily meet the government-sponsored entities' requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities' guidelines for documentation, property type, debt
and loan-to-value ratios. The weighted average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the Company was "B1" and "Ba3" at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company
does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans

        At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of
$1.17 billion and $938 million, respectively. The Company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or
liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities. For more information regarding the Company's investments in commercial mortgage-backed
securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Equity Securities Available for Sale, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments

    See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes.

Other Investments

    The Company also invests in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. Also included in other investments
are non-public common and preferred equities and derivatives. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $3.53 billion and $3.45 billion, respectively.

Securities Lending

        The Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of
its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $304 million and $286 million of securities on loan, respectively,
as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2017 and 2016 was $318 million and $346 million, respectively. Borrowers of these
securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities

108

plus
accrued interest. The Company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Lloyd's Trust Deposits

    The Company meets its capital requirements to support its underwriting at Lloyd's using a combination of trust deposits and uncollateralized
letters of credit. Securities with a fair value of approximately $37 million and $97 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively, and $33 million held by TRV at December 31, 2017, were pledged into Lloyd's trust accounts to provide a portion of the Lloyd's capital requirements. For more
information regarding the Company's utilization of uncollateralized letters of credit, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" herein.

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

    Net
unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 increased from the prior year-end, primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in market
interest rates in 2017 and the tax effect of the TCJA. Net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity at December 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year-end, primarily
reflecting the impact of an increase in market interest rates in 2016.

    At
December 31, 2017, the amount of gross unrealized losses for all fixed maturity and equity investments reported at fair value for which fair value was less than 80% of
amortized cost for fixed maturity investments and cost for equity investments was not significant.

    For
fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability
to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity.

    At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, below investment grade securities comprised 2.7% and 2.9%, respectively, of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below
investment grade securities at December 31, 2017 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $313 million and a fair value of
$305 million, resulting in a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $8 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented approximately 0.5% of the total amortized
cost and 0.5% of the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2017 and accounted for 4.5% of the total gross pre-tax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio
at December 31, 2017.

    Purchases
and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to
be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company's ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations.

CATASTROPHE MODELING

        The Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to make underwriting and
reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe
estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.

    The
Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling
processes. The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors including non-modeled
losses, to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. These proprietary models are continually updated as new information and techniques emerge.

Table of Contents

    The tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim
adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars, net of tax at the newly enacted federal tax rate of
21%, and as a percentage of the Company's common equity), based on the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the Company at December 31, 2017. For example, on the basis
described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company's loss from a single U.S. and Canadian hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed
$1.6 billion, or 7% of the Company's common equity at December 31, 2017.

--------------------------- ---------------------------------- --- ----------------------------------- - ---
 Dollars (in billions)
Likelihood of Exceedance(1) Single U.S. and Canadian Hurricane Single U.S. and Canadian Earthquake
2.0% (1-in-50) $ 1.2 $ 0.5
1.0% (1-in-100) $ 1.6 $ 0.8
0.4% (1-in-250) $ 2.2 $ 1.2
0.1% (1-in-1,000) $ 4.6 $ 1.9

------------------------ ---------------------------------- -- ----------------------------------- - -
 Percentage of Common Equity(2)
Likelihood of Exceedance Single U.S. and Canadian Hurricane Single U.S. and Canadian Earthquake
2.0% (1-in-50) 5 % 2 %
1.0% (1-in-100) 7 % 3 %
0.4% (1-in-250) 10 % 5 %
0.1% (1-in-1,000) 21 % 9 %

(1)An
event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a "1-in-50 year event." As noted above, however, the probabilities in
the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the
probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential
aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe.

(2)The
percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized
investment gains and losses, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors
and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact
of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.

    The
threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company's in-force portfolio at December 31, 2017 and catastrophe reinsurance program at January 1,
2018, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. For further information regarding the Company's
reinsurance, see "Item 1—Reinsurance." The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an
adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company's catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm
surge. The amounts for earthquakes

111

Table of Contents

reflect
U.S. and Canadian property and workers' compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other
exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.

    Catastrophe
modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may
result in volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe
modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe
modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of
exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an
event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.

    Moreover,
the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed
to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other
naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events.

    For
more information about the Company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see "Item 1A—Risk
Factors—Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and
could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "Item 1A—Risk Factors—We may be adversely affected if
our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results."

CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS

    Severe weather events over the last two decades have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding
insurers' exposures to
financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather-related events. For example, hurricane and storm surge activity have impacted areas further inland than previously experienced, and
demographic changes have resulted in larger populations in coastal areas which historically have been subject to severe storms, thus expanding the Company's potential for losses from hurricanes.
Additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the United States have been more volatile during the last decade. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased
losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events. Demographic changes in areas prone to wildfires have also expanded the Company's potential for losses from wildfires. Additionally, the
Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability in frequency and severity of severe weather events or other emerging trends in climate conditions.

    The
Company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under "Item 1A—Risk Factors" and "Outlook." For example,
among other things:

• Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by
the Company. See "Risk Factors—Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our
ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "—Outlook—Underwriting Gain/Loss."

• Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests. For example, water
supply adequacy could impact the

112

Table of Contents

creditworthiness
of bond issuers in the Southwestern United States, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the Southeastern United States, among
other areas. See "Risk Factors—Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses."

• Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers. For example,
state insurance regulation could impact the Company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. If the Company is unable to implement risk based
pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its
business may be adversely affected. See "Risk Factors—Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could
adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance." In addition, climate change regulation could increase the Company's customers' costs of doing
business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time,
increase loss exposures. Increased regulation may also result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses.

• The full range of potential liability exposures related to changing climate conditions continues to evolve. Through the Company's Emerging
Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate
change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. The Company regularly reviews emerging issues, including changing climate conditions, to consider
potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products. See "Risk
Factors—The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain."

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

    The Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. For additional discussion regarding the
Company's reinsurance coverage, see "Part I—Item 1—Reinsurance."

    The
following table summarizes the composition of the Company's reinsurance recoverables:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---- ----- ---- - ----- -
(at December 31, in millions) 2017 2016
Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses $ 3,303 $ 3,181
Allowance for uncollectible reinsurance (111 ) (116 )
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Net reinsurance recoverables 3,192 3,065
Mandatory pools and associations 2,011 2,054
Structured settlements 3,106 3,168
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Total reinsurance recoverables $ 8,309 $ 8,287
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

    The
$127 million increase in net reinsurance recoverables over December 31, 2016 primarily reflected the impacts of catastrophe losses and the asbestos reserve increase in
2017, partially offset by cash collections in 2017, including the settlement of certain disputes as discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents

    The
following table presents the Company's top five reinsurer groups by reinsurance recoverable at December 31, 2017 (in millions). Also included is the A.M. Best rating of
each reinsurer group at February 15, 2018:

--------------------------- ----------------------- --- ------------------------------------------------- --- ----------------------------
Reinsurer Group Reinsurance Recoverable A.M. Best Rating of Group's Predominant Reinsurer
Swiss Re Group $ 429 A+ second highest of 16 ratings
Berkshire Hathaway 271 A++ highest of 16 ratings
Munich Re Group 256 A+ second highest of 16 ratings
Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Group 199 A+ second highest of 16 ratings
XL Capital Group 164 A third highest of 16 ratings

    At
December 31, 2017, the Company held $972 million of collateral in the form of letters of credit, funds and trust agreements held to fully or partially collateralize
certain reinsurance recoverables.

    Included
in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal
physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life
insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would
recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance
company fails to make the required annuity
payments, the Company would be required to make such payments. The following table presents the Company's top five groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2017 (in millions).
Also included is the A.M. Best rating of the Company's predominant insurer from each insurer group at February 15, 2018:

    The
Company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of
its allowance for uncollectible amounts.

OUTLOOK

    The following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company's results of operations and capital position.

         Premiums.    The Company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal
business and new
business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease
(renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles
or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions,
which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected
to remain competitive. Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

    Overall,
the Company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during
2018. In Business Insurance, the Company expects that domestic renewal premium changes during 2018 will remain positive and will be higher than the levels attained in 2017. In Bond & Specialty
Insurance, the Company expects that renewal premium changes with respect to domestic management liability business during 2018 will remain positive and will be broadly consistent with the levels
attained in 2017. With respect to domestic surety business within Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that net written premium volume during 2018 will be slightly higher than in
2017. In Personal Insurance, the Company expects that domestic Agency Auto renewal premium changes will be positive and broadly consistent with the levels attained in 2017. The Company expects
domestic Agency Auto renewal premium changes will be higher in the first half of 2018 and lower in the second half of 2018 compared with the same periods of 2017. The Company expects that domestic
Agency Homeowners and Other renewal premium changes during 2018 will remain positive and will be slightly higher than the levels attained in 2017. The need for state regulatory approval for changes to
personal property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes. Given the relatively smaller amount of premium
that the Company generates from outside the United States and the transactional nature of some of those markets, particularly Lloyd's, international renewal premium changes in each segment during 2018
could be somewhat higher, broadly consistent with or somewhat lower than the levels attained in 2017.

    Property
and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2018 for new business. In each of the Company's business segments, new business generally has
less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business,
despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time.

    Economic
conditions in the United States and elsewhere could change, due to a variety of factors, including the political and regulatory environment, the U.S. Federal budget and further
potential changes in tax laws in the United States, the repeal, replacement or modification of the Affordable Care Act, the imposition of tariffs or other barriers to international trade, the United
Kingdom's

115

Table of Contents

withdrawal
from the European Union, rapid changes in commodity prices and fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The resulting changes in levels of economic activity could
positively or negatively impact exposure changes at renewal and the Company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. Additionally, changes in levels of economic activity could positively or
negatively impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. All of the foregoing, in turn, could positively or negatively impact net written
premiums during 2018, and because earned premiums are a function of net written premiums, earned premiums could be impacted on a lagging basis.

        Underwriting Gain/Loss.    The Company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or
unfavorable
prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins.

    Catastrophe
losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if
significant catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur.

    For
a number of years, the Company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However,
given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year
reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.

    It
is possible that changes in economic conditions could lead to higher inflation than the Company had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase in the Company's loss costs
and the need to strengthen claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those
lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. For a further
discussion, see "Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated
level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the
legal, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected."

    In
Business Insurance, the Company expects underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017,
assuming lower (and more normalized) levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other loss activity.

    In
Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2018 will be broadly
consistent with the same period of 2017, and in the last quarter of 2018, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins will be higher and the underlying combined ratio will be lower than
in the same period of 2017.

    In
Personal Insurance, the Company expects underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017. In
Agency Automobile, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio will improve during 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting actions taken to improve
profitability. In Agency Homeowners and Other, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio in 2018 will be broadly consistent with 2017, assuming lower
(and more normalized) levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other loss activity.

         Income Taxes.    As a result of the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act
(TCJA) in December 2017, the Company's effective tax rate will decline in 2018. The Company expects its 2018 results of operations will benefit from the impact of that rate change. Under current GAAP
reporting guidance, there is potential variability in the Company's effective tax rate due to the manner in which changes in corporate tax rates are reported on items reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI), particularly the tax related to unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities. In February 2018, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to address the effects
of the change in tax rates in the TCJA on items reported in AOCI; however, the new guidance is only applicable to changes resulting from the enactment of the TCJA and does not apply to future changes
in tax laws and rates.

         Investment Portfolio.    The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment
portfolio and a
relatively short average effective duration. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31,
2017. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At December 31, 2017, the Company had
$400 million notional value of open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company's investments
are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.

    The
Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. These
investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.

    Net
investment income is a material contributor to the Company's results of operations. Based on the impacts of (i) the lower federal corporate income tax rate in 2018,
(ii) slightly higher levels of fixed maturities and (iii) higher short-term investment yields, partially offset by the impact of (iv) expected lower reinvestment yields on fixed
maturity investments, the Company expects that during 2018, after-tax net investment income from those portfolios will be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher on a quarterly
basis as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2017. The impact of future market conditions on net investment income from the non-fixed maturity investment portfolio during 2018 is hard to
predict. If general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions change during 2018, the Company could experience an increase or decrease in net investment income and/or significant
realized investment gains or losses (including impairments).

    The
Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $1.38 billion ($1.09 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017.
While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce
shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. The Company's investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related
to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in
these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company's investment portfolio. See "Changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact
us" included in "Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors."

    In
2017, the Company had net pre-tax realized investment gains of $216 million, which were primarily driven by gains on sales of equity securities. Pursuant to updated FASB
guidance and beginning January 1, 2018, the Company's equity securities, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, that have readily determinable fair value will be
measured at fair value

117

Table of Contents

with
changes in fair value recognized as part of net realized investment gains in net income. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the Company's equity securities was
$453 million, which included $13 million of net pre-tax unrealized investment gains. The Company currently expects that net pre-tax realized investment gains related to equity securities
in 2018, if any, will be lower than in 2017.

disruption and risks to the Company's investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled "During or following a period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, our business could be
materially and adversely affected" and "Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses" included in
"Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors." For a discussion of the risks to the Company's investments from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see the risk factor
entitled "We are also subject to a number of additional risks associated with our business outside the United States" included in "Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors"
and see "Part II—Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk."

        Capital Position.    The Company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value,
expects to
continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders. The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and
common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income. In addition, the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of additional factors,
including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies,
funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including
mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors. For information regarding the Company's common share repurchases in 2017, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

    As
a result of the Company's business outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom (including Lloyd's), the Republic of Ireland and Brazil, the Company's capital
is also subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in a reduction of
shareholders' equity. For additional discussion of the Company's foreign exchange market risk exposure, see "Part II—Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk."

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    Liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations and to
satisfy general corporate purposes when needed.

        Operating Company Liquidity.    The liquidity requirements of the Company's insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated
from premiums,
fees, income received on investments and investment maturities. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. The
insurance subsidiaries' liquidity requirements can be impacted by, among other factors, the timing and amount of catastrophe claims, which are inherently
unpredictable, as well as the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries, which may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. Additionally, the variability of
asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. It is the opinion of
the Company's management that the insurance subsidiaries' future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the sources described above. Subject to restrictions imposed by states in which the
Company's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the Company's principal insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to their respective parent companies, which, in turn, pay dividends to the corporate
holding (parent) company (TRV). For further information regarding restrictions on dividends paid by the Company's insurance subsidiaries, see
"Part I—Item 1—Regulation."

        Holding Company Liquidity.    TRV's liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt servicing, common share
repurchases and, from
time to time, contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. At December 31, 2017, TRV held total cash and short-term invested assets in the United States aggregating
$1.27 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 71 days. TRV has established a holding company liquidity target equal to its estimated annual pre-tax interest expense and common
shareholder dividends (currently approximately $1.1 billion). TRV's holding company liquidity of $1.27 billion at December 31, 2017 exceeded this target and it is the opinion of
the Company's management that these assets are sufficient to meet TRV's current liquidity requirements.

    TRV
is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign
operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company's financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2017.

    TRV
has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires on June 17, 2019 which permits it to issue securities from time to time. TRV
also has a $1.0 billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 7, 2018. This line of credit also supports TRV's $800 million
commercial paper program. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding. TRV is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating
cash flow needs.

    The
Company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately $347 million to provide a portion of the capital needed to
support its obligations at Lloyd's at December 31, 2017. If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize
these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand.

    On
August 4, 2017, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings Ltd (Simply Business), a
leading provider of small business insurance policies in the United Kingdom, for a purchase price of approximately $464 million,
which included the repayment of debt and other obligations of Simply Business. In addition, the Company issued 95,953 shares of restricted common stock valued at approximately $12 million to

119

Table of Contents

certain
employees of Simply Business who were equity holders of Simply Business. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in May 2017 (described in more detail
in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements) and internal resources to fund this transaction.

Operating Activities

        Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.76 billion, $4.20 billion and $3.43 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The decrease in cash flows in 2017 reflected higher levels of payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses, the inclusion in 2016 of proceeds from the settlement of a reinsurance
dispute as discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements, higher commission expenses and a higher discretionary contribution to the Company's U.S.
qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, partially offset by higher levels of collected premiums and lower income tax payments. The higher level of payments for claims and claim
adjustment expenses in 2017 included the impact of increased business volumes and a higher level of catastrophe losses, partially offset by the inclusion in 2016 of the Company's $524 million
payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc. litigation as described in more detail in the "Asbestos Claims and Litigation" section. The increase in cash flows in 2016
reflected higher levels of collected premiums, proceeds from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute discussed above and lower income tax payments, partially offset by higher levels of payments for
claims and claim adjustment expenses, general and administrative expenses and commission expenses. The higher level of payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 included the Company's
$524 million payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc. litigation discussed above. Cash flows in 2015 included the Company's $579 million payment related to
the Direct Action Settlements and a lower level of net investment income, partially offset by a higher level of collected premiums and a lower contribution to the Company's qualified domestic pension
plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company voluntarily made contributions totaling $300 million, $200 million and $100 million, respectively, to its qualified domestic pension
plan. The qualified domestic pension plan was 108% and 101% funded at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Investing Activities

        Net cash used in investing activities was $1.82 billion and $1.46 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, compared with net cash
provided by investing activities of $317 million in 2015. The Company's consolidated total investments at December 31, 2017 increased by $2.01 billion, or 3% over year-end 2016,
primarily reflecting the impacts of net cash flows provided by operating activities and an increase in the unrealized appreciation of investments, partially offset by common share repurchases,
dividends paid to shareholders and the cost of acquiring Simply Business. The Company's consolidated total investments at December 31, 2016 increased by $18 million, or less than 1% from
year-end 2015, primarily reflecting net cash flows provided by operating activities, largely offset by common share repurchases, a decrease in the unrealized appreciation of investments and dividends
paid to shareholders.

    The
Company's investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. As such, the primary
goals of the Company's asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally,
the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company's insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact
cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow
from newly sold

120

Table of Contents

policies
and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.

Financing Activities

        Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1.92 billion, $2.81 billion and $3.73 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The totals in each year primarily reflected common
share repurchases, dividends paid to shareholders and the payment of debt, partially offset by the issuance of debt and proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Common share repurchases in 2017,
2016 and 2015 were $1.44 billion, $2.47 billion and $3.22 billion, respectively.

Debt Transactions.

         2017.    On May 22, 2017, the Company issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes that will mature on
May 30, 2047. The net proceeds of the issuance, after the deduction of the underwriting discount and expenses payable by the Company, totaled approximately $689 million. Interest on the
senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 30 and November 30. Prior to November 30, 2046, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's
option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present
values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to November 30, 2046 on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted
to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate (as defined in the senior notes), plus 15 basis points.
On or after November 30, 2046, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

    On
June 2, 2017, the Company redeemed the remaining $107 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 at a
price per debenture of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. On December 15, 2017, the Company's $450 million, 5.75% senior notes
matured and were fully paid.

         2016.    On May 11, 2016, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes that will mature on
May 15, 2046. The net proceeds of the issuance, after the deduction of underwriting and other expenses, totaled approximately $491 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15. Prior to November 15, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from
time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of principal and interest on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis
(assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate (as defined in the senior notes),
plus 20 basis points. On or after November 15, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

    On
June 20, 2016, the Company's $400 million, 6.25% senior notes matured and were fully paid.

         2015.    On August 25, 2015, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.30% senior notes that will mature
on
August 25, 2045. The net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, totaled approximately
$392 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on

February 25
and August 25. Prior to February 25, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from time to time, at a
redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of
principal and interest on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate (as defined in the senior notes), plus 25 basis points. On or after February 25, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in
whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed.

    On
December 1, 2015, the Company's $400 million, 5.50% senior notes matured and were fully paid.

        Dividends.    Dividends paid to shareholders were $785 million, $757 million and $739 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's common stock will be at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the
Company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the Board of Directors deems
relevant. Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. On
January 23, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share, payable March 30, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 9, 2018.

         Share Repurchases.    The Company's Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be
made from time
to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The
authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial
position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the Company's qualified
pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related
financings), market conditions and other factors. In April 2017, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization that added an additional $5.0 billion of repurchase capacity.
The following table summarizes repurchase activity in 2017 and remaining repurchase capacity at December 31, 2017.

--------------------------------------------------------------- - ---------------------------- ---- -------------------------- - ---------------------------- - ------------------------------------------------------- ------ - - ----- -

    From
the inception of the first authorization on May 2, 2006 through December 31, 2017, the Company has repurchased a cumulative total of 487.7 million shares for a
total cost of $31.44 billion, or an average of $64.48 per share.

122

Table of Contents

    In
2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company acquired 0.5 million, 0.6 million and 0.7 million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock
primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and shares used by employees to cover the price of certain
stock options that were exercised.

Capital Resources

    Capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new
capital to meet its needs. The following table summarizes the components of the Company's capital structure at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

-------------------------------------------------------------- - ---- ------ ---- - ------ -
(at December 31, in millions) 2017 2016
Debt:
Short-term $ 600 $ 550
Long-term 6,004 5,911
Net unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs (33 ) (24 )
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Total debt 6,571 6,437
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Shareholders' equity:
Common stock and retained earnings, less treasury stock 24,074 23,976
Accumulated other comprehensive loss (343 ) (755 )
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Total shareholders' equity 23,731 23,221
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Total capitalization $ 30,302 $ 29,658
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

    Total
capitalization at December 31, 2017 was $30.30 billion, $644 million higher than at December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of net income of
$2.06 billion, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $412 million due to changes in unrealized appreciation on investments and unrealized foreign currency translation,
proceeds from the exercise of employee share options of $173 million and an increase in debt outstanding of $134 million, partially offset by common share repurchases totaling
$1.38 billion under the Company's share repurchase authorization and shareholder dividends of $789 million.

    The
following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization to total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders'
equity:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---- ------ ---- - ------ -
(at December 31, dollars in millions) 2017 2016
Total capitalization $ 30,302 $ 29,658
Less: net unrealized gain on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity 1,112 730
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity $ 29,190 $ 28,928
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Debt-to-total capital ratio 21.7 % 21.7 %
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity 22.5 % 22.3 %
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

    The
debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity, is calculated by dividing (a) debt by
(b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be
significantly impacted by both interest rate

movements
and other economic factors. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to
understand the Company's financial leverage position. The Company's ratio of debt-to-total capital excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity of 22.5% at
December 31, 2017 was within the Company's target range of 15% to 25%.

        Credit Agreement.    The Company is a party to a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial
institutions
that expires on June 7, 2018. Terms of the credit agreement are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

         Shelf Registration.    The Company has filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that
expires on
June 17, 2019 for the potential offering and sale of securities. The Company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering.

        Share Repurchase Authorization.    At December 31, 2017, the Company had $4.56 billion of capacity remaining under its share
repurchase
authorization approved by the Board of Directors.

Contractual Obligations

        The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2017, the Company's future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims
and claim-related payments. The table excludes short-term obligations and includes only liabilities at December 31, 2017 that are expected to be settled in cash.

    The
table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments. The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates,
generally utilizing actuarial projection techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on
the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors.
Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and
legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the
policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity
considerations) and timing. Amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim-related payments has
unavoidable estimation uncertainty.

claim
adjustment expenses, gross of reinsurance recoverables, excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies.

The
Company has entered into reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to losses and protect its capital as described in note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In
order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. Since the
timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are
recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. The presence of any feature
that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance. The assumptions used in estimating the amount
and
timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities.

The
estimated future cash inflows from the Company's reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows:

 ------------------------ ----- ----- ---------------- - ----------- ----------- --- ------------- - --- - -----
 (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years After 5 Years
 Reinsurance recoverables $ 5,106 $ 838 $ 913 $ 526 $ 2,829

The
Company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses on a net of reinsurance basis. The estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as
follows:

 ----------------------------------------- ----- ------ ---------------- - ----------- ----------- ------ ------------- - ----- - ------
 (in millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years After 5 Years
 Claims and claim adjustment expenses, net $ 42,540 $ 9,522 $ 10,446 $ 5,152 $ 17,420

For
business underwritten by non-U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on
December 31, 2017.

The
amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly,
the amounts above will differ from the Company's balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted
in the balance sheet. See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

(7)Workers'
compensation large deductible policies provide third-party coverage in which the Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such
policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. "Claims from large deductible policies" represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses
below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as
"contractholder payables" and "contractholder receivables," respectively. Most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder's escrow, which is periodically replenished by the
policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within "Claims and claim adjustment expenses" in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the deductible
(contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table.

(8)The
amounts in "Loss-based assessments" relate to estimated future payments of second-injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim
liabilities. Second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. For loss-based assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry and
self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. Amounts relating to second-injury fund assessments are included in "other liabilities" in the
consolidated balance sheet.

(9)The
amounts in "Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits" represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as
deposits. Amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in "other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet.

(10)The
amounts in "Payout from ceded funds withheld" represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements
whereby the Company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held.

(11)The
Company's current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are $230 million. Offsetting these liabilities are
deferred tax assets of $207 million associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized.

    The
above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event
of default by the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. In addition, the Company is not currently
subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. Accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table.

Dividend Availability

    The Company's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the State of Connecticut. The insurance holding company laws of Connecticut
applicable to the Company's subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions
made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer's statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurer's net income for the
twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or payment is further
limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. The insurance holding company laws of other states in which the Company's subsidiaries are
domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. A maximum of $2.66 billion is available by the end of 2018
for such dividends to the holding company, TRV, without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. The Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2018 and/or increase the amount
of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2018, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the Connecticut Insurance Department.

    In
addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be
paid to the Company's shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the Company to
maintain a

consolidated net worth as described in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

    TRV
is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign
operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company's financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2017.

    TRV
and its two non-insurance holding company subsidiaries received dividends of $2.33 billion, $3.05 billion and $3.75 billion from their U.S. insurance
subsidiaries in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

    The Company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the Qualified Plan), which covers substantially all U.S.
domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula. In addition, the Company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly-compensated
employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for
certain retirees.

    The
Qualified Plan is subject to regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and
requires such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The Company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the Qualified Plan
for 2018 and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2019. The Company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding
requirements. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, there was no minimum funding requirement for the Qualified Plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company voluntarily made contributions totaling $300 million,
$200 million and $100 million, respectively, to the Qualified Plan. Based on its funded status at December 31, 2017, the Company does not currently anticipate making a voluntary
contribution to the Qualified Plan in 2018. In determining future contributions, the Company will consider the performance of the plan's investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the
projected benefit obligation of the plan and the Company's other capital requirements.

    In
2016, the Company began using a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and
nonqualified domestic pension plans and its domestic postretirement benefit plans. For a full discussion of the rationale and impact of this change in approach, see note 14 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

    The
Qualified Plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. The Company's overall strategy is to achieve a mix of
approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target
allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. For 2018, the Company plans to apply an
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00%, the same rate that was applied in 2017. The expected rate of return reflects the Company's current expectations with regard to long-term
returns in the capital markets, taking into account the pension plan's asset allocation targets, the historical performance and current valuation of U.S. and international equities, and the level of
long term interest rate and inflation expectations. The Company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets also contemplates a return to more normal levels of long-term interest rates in the
future.

Risk-Based Capital

    The NAIC has an RBC requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which determines minimum capital requirements and is
intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. The Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws that have been adopted by
individual states. These requirements subject insurers having policyholders' surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of
capital inadequacy. Each of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders' surplus at December 31, 2017 significantly above the level at which any RBC regulatory action would
occur. Regulators in the
jurisdictions in which the Company's foreign insurance subsidiaries are located require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount
of insurance policies in force. Each of the Company's foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at December 31, 2017.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

        The Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to selling businesses to third parties, certain investments,
third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. See note 16 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these arrangements will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

    The Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related
reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and impairments, and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments.

    The
$1.70 billion increase in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2016 primarily reflected the impacts of (i) catastrophe losses
incurred in the second half of 2017 and (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures and loss cost trends for the current accident year, partially offset by the impacts of (iii) payments
related to operations in runoff and (iv) net favorable prior year reserve development.

    Asbestos
and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril and International and other lines in the foregoing summary table. Asbestos and
environmental reserves are discussed separately; see "Asbestos Claims and Litigation", "Environmental Claims and Litigation" and "Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental
Reserves."

    Claims
and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported
and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) as of the balance sheet date. Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but
instead represent management estimates, primarily utilizing actuarial expertise and projection methods. These estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims
will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity
and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, the Company also considers salvage and
subrogation. Estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in "Reinsurance Recoverables" as an asset on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company.

    The
process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both
internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative
changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Estimation difficulties also differ significantly by
product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time
between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual
experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. The Company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as
historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the
estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses,
as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different than the amount currently recorded—favorable or unfavorable.

    Because
establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.

    There
are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes and other
catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas,

130

Table of Contents

the
complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the interpretation of policy terms and conditions, and the nature of the information available
to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures;
estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance
collectibility. The timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting
period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.

    A
portion of the Company's gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $1.91 billion at December 31, 2017) are for asbestos and environmental claims and
related litigation. While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded
theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties
regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current insurance reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company's future operating results. See the
preceding discussion of "Asbestos Claims and Litigation" and "Environmental Claims and Litigation."

General Discussion

    The process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data
on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by
actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a
component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information.

    Multiple
estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and
disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative
strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change
with each evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated.

    In
most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable
estimates for any particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves by reporting segments are reasonable, given
available information. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of
management's recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate.

    The
exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for
an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In
addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process.

131

Table of Contents

    Property-casualty
insurance policies are either written on a "claims-made" or on an "occurrence" basis. Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual
policies, claims reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured
reports the loss many years later.

    Most
general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years
following the policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction
general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of loss trends, which can be influenced by a number
of factors, including future inflation, judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends (e.g., size of jury awards and propensity of individuals to pursue litigation), among others.

    A
basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors
discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is estimated to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if
available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant
structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process. In addition, the introduction of new products creates a unique risk as
historical company data would typically not be available.

    Informed
judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In
addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. Therefore, management may have to
consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger,
consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult.

    The
variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the
reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line.

    Product
lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final
resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time to final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to
estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty.

    A
major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes
estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with
material reporting lags can result in adding several years' worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with
estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses for such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims.

    For
some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being "low frequency/high severity," while lines without
this "large claim"

132

Table of Contents

sensitivity
are referred to as "high frequency/low severity." Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large
claims. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the
range of reasonable reserve estimates is likely narrower and more stable.

    Claim
complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and
claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater
estimation uncertainty.

    Actuaries
have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial
judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional
experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other.

    Lastly,
significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. Events such as mergers increase the
inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization.

Risk Factors

    The major causes of material uncertainty ("risk factors") generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed
component of the product line. In a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume
that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary
from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently.

    Some
risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions,
court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line.
Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components.

    The
effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the
risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors.

    The
evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one
geographic region may be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region.

    While
some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more
evolutionary. Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. The final
impact is not known until all steps have occurred.

133

Table of Contents

    Sudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact.
Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable.

Actuarial Methods for Analyzing and Estimating Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense
Reserves

    The principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the Company's actuaries to evaluate management's existing estimates for prior accident
periods are the paid loss development method, the case incurred development method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development
method. The BF method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. These
estimation and analysis methods
are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods. (See note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of these methods).

    While
the Company utilizes these conventional actuarial methods to estimate the claims liability for its various businesses, Company actuaries evaluating a particular component for a
product line may select from the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession. The Company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession
for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates.

    Some
components of a product line may be susceptible to infrequent large claims or not be subject to conventional methods. In such cases, the Company's actuarial analysis will isolate
such components for review. The reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described above. The reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed
utilizing various methods, such as:

• Estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods, adjusted for the current
environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available.

• Utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim
adjuster estimates. (This monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates).

• Utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims
from conventional analysis.

• Ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental).

    The
results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including implied incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios, non-zero claim severity trends
and paid-to-incurred loss ratios. An actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development embedded within management's best estimate. Additional
analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods.

    The
methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management's estimate for prior accident periods. For the initial estimate of the current accident year, however, the
available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. As a result, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on an exposure-based method using either the
loss ratio projection method or the expected loss method. The loss ratio projection method, which is typically used for guaranteed-cost business, develops an initial estimate for an accident year by
multiplying earned premiums for the accident year by a projected loss ratio. The projected loss ratio is determined by analyzing prior period

134

Table of Contents

experience,
and adjusting for loss cost trends, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident
years. The exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the stability and consistency of the individual accident year estimates. The expected loss method,
which is typically used for loss sensitive business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year by analyzing exposures by account.

Management's Estimates

    At least once per quarter, certain members of Company management meet with the Company's actuaries to review the latest claims and claim
adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data
provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one
geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern
represents a change in ultimate claim liability.

    Such
an assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change
is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several
months to perform as the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews
with experts involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Company's
estimated claim liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable
information.

    The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the process by which the Company establishes reserves for the purpose of the Company's financial statements.

Discussion of Product Lines

    The following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. There are many additional risk factors that may
impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For
example, in workers' compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in
almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation.

    In
order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one-year
period are provided for the U.S. product lines. This information is provided for both the Company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available
data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. These changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in
Schedule P of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years
combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. Data presented for the Company includes history for the entire Travelers group (U.S. companies only), as required by the statutory
reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for Schedule P. Comparable data for non-U.S. companies is not available.

General Liability

    General liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a
given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the characteristics of claims, including specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy
provisions such as self-insured retentions, among others. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with
most of the claims for a given accident year closed within five to seven years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade or
more for "construction defect" claims).

    While
the majority of general liability coverages are written on an "occurrence" basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering management and professional liability,
including cyber coverages) are typically insured on a "claims-made" basis.

    General
liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property
damage. Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder's legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as
negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical
treatment costs. Property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant's private property arising from the policyholder's legal obligation for non-intentional acts. In most cases,
property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter.

    In
addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. These exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect and large unique accounts that
would otherwise distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods.

    Defense
costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this
risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs is included in the policy limit available to pay the claim. Such "defense within the limits" policies are most
common for "claims-made" products. When defense costs are outside of the policy limits, the full amount of the policy limit is available to pay claims and the amounts paid for defense costs have no
contractual limit.

    This
line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to
this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties
involved in the underlying tort action, whether the "event" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the
individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the
potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater estimation uncertainty. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where
courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential
dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain
market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure).

Table of Contents

    The
amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency,
longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity
issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect and other mass tort actions. Many components of general liability are not subject to material
latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, components with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in
settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential
result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than components without those characteristics.

    In
addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development and S-curve methods for the
construction defect components of this product line. The Construction Defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for IBNR claim counts. For
components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the company relies more heavily on the BF method than on the paid and case incurred
development methods.

    Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:

General liability risk factors

• Changes in claim handling philosophies

• Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions

• New or expanded theories of liability

• Trends in jury awards

• Changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues

• Changes in the propensity to litigate rather than settle a claim

• Changes in statutes of limitations

• Changes in the underlying court system

• Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues

• Changes in tort law

• Shifts in lawsuit mix between federal and state courts

• Changes in claim adjuster processes or reporting which may cause distortions in the data being analyzed

    Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability
(excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.

    Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from
–8% to –3% (averaging –4%) for the Company, and from –5% to 0% (averaging –3%) for the industry overall. The Company's
year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year
changes in reserve estimates for this product line. General liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 20% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment
expense reserves.

    The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, was –4% for 2017, –4% for 2016 and
–3% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2009 through 2016. The 2016
change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2015 and prior. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss
experience for excess coverages for accident years 2005 through 2013.

Commercial Property

    Commercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability
coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line,
except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the
insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims.

    Commercial
property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk
factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:

Commercial property risk factors

• Physical concentration of policyholders

• Availability and cost of local contractors

• For the more severe catastrophic events, "demand surge" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and
labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services

• Local building codes

• Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims)

• Frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed

• Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)

138

Table of Contents

• Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment
on roofs)

• Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations

Commercial property book of business risk factors

• Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)

• Changes in underwriting standards

    Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1%
increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from –25% to –5% (averaging
–15%) for the Company, and from –14% to –5% (averaging –8%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by,
and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this
product line. Commercial property reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    Since
commercial property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for commercial property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due
to the fact that the majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year
uncertainty is relevant to commercial property because of weather-related events which, notwithstanding 2013 through 2016 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and
generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. The reserve estimates for this product line are
also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as the events of September 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina and Storm
Sandy.

    The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was –9% for 2017, –9% for 2016 and –21% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily
reflected better than expected loss experience related to non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2015 and 2016. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to
non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2014 and 2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to catastrophe losses for accident years 2011, 2012 and 2014,
and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2013 and 2014.

Commercial Multi-Peril

        Commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both
short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it
takes a longer period of time to close claims.

    The
reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or other large single loss events. The
reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. Commercial multi-peril is generally sold to small-
to mid-sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers.

139

Table of Contents

    See
"Commercial property risk factors" and "General liability risk factors," discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril.

    Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial
multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves.

    Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from
–9% to 5% (averaging 0%) for the Company, and from –6% to 1% (averaging –2%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by,
and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this
product line. Commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 8% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    As
discussed above, this line combines general liability and commercial property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines.

    The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was –5% for 2017, 1% for 2016 and –1% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected better
than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2016 and prior. The 2016 change primarily reflected worse than expected loss experience for property coverages related to
non-catastrophe losses for accident year 2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for property coverages related to non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2012
and 2014.

Commercial Automobile

        The commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages.
The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult
to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are generally short, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate
severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.

    Commercial
automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. These last two
components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented.

    The
Company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. This is supplemented with detailed custom
analyses where needed.

    Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:

Bodily injury and property damage liability risk factors

• Trends in jury awards

• Changes in the underlying court system

• Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.)

• Changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non-fleets)

• Changes in underwriting standards

    Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial
automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from –6% to 7% (averaging 1%) for the Company, and
from –3% to 7% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that
its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the
Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 4% for 2017, –1% for 2016 and 0% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected worse than expected loss
experience for liability coverages for accident years 2013 through 2016. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2011 and prior.

Workers' Compensation

    Workers' compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given
accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several
years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability

141

Table of Contents

benefits
and on-going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, payment obligations are generally not complex, and most of the liability can
be considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from
a worker's injury, as such claims are subject to greater inflation risk. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk.

    Workers'
compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses.

    Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers' compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:

Indemnity risk factors

• Time required to recover from the injury

• Degree of available transitional jobs

• Degree of legal involvement

• Changes in the interpretations and processes of the administrative bodies that oversee workers' compensation claims

• Future wage inflation for states that index benefits

• Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds

Medical risk factors

• Changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules ("inflation")

• Frequency of visits to health providers

• Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers

• Types of health providers used

• Type of medical treatments received

• Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices

• Availability of new medical processes and equipment

• Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs, including drugs for pain management

• Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment

General workers' compensation risk factors

• Frequency of reopening claims previously closed

• Mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment

• Changes in statutory benefits

• Degree of cost shifting between workers' compensation and health insurance, including Medicare, and the impact, if any, of the Affordable Care
Act

    Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers'
compensation, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from –3% to 0% (averaging –1%)
for the Company, and from –2% to 1% (averaging –1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events
during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Workers' compensation
reserves represent approximately 39% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was –3% for 2017, –2% for 2016 and –1% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily
reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2016 and prior. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2006 and prior as well as
accident years 2009, 2013 and 2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2006 and prior.

Fidelity and Surety

    Fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle most fidelity claims.
The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured's business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment
point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. The high frequency, low
severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates, whereas the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of
ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity claims.

    Surety
has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can
result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project(s) or commercial transaction being insured. The frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with
economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured to fulfill its contractual obligations. The Company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through
disciplined risk selection, adherence to underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring of contractor progress in significant construction projects. The volatility of surety losses is generally related
to the type of business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as
unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an insured's assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in
nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting
reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured.

    Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from –36% to –6%
(averaging –18%) for the Company, and from –17% to –2% (averaging –10%) for the industry overall. The Company's
year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year
changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 1% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    In
general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line.

    The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was –10% for 2017, –36% for 2016 and –30% for 2015. The 2017 change
primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in

the
fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2014 and 2015. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident
years 2009 through 2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2008 through 2014, which was partially
driven by a reduction in outstanding exposures related to the financial crisis that commenced in 2007.

Personal Automobile

    Personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage
(property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively
short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity
product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.

    Personal
automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims.
These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented.

    Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve

expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident year 2015. The change for 2015 primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2012
through 2014.

Homeowners and Personal Lines Other

    Homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim
reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of
several months are not unusual. The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist.

    The
liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags.
Personal Lines Other products include personal umbrella policies, among others. See "general liability reserving risk factors," discussed above, for reserving risk factors related to umbrella
coverages.

    Overall,
the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity.

    Homeowners
reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments.

    Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section)
include:

Non-catastrophe risk factors

• Salvage opportunities

• Amount of time to return property to residential use

• Changes in weather patterns

• Local building codes

• Construction and building material costs

• Litigation trends

• Trends in jury awards

• Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)

• Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment
on roofs)

• Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations

Catastrophe risk factors

• Physical concentration of policyholders

• Availability and cost of local contractors

• Local building codes

• Quality of construction of damaged homes

• Amount of time to return property to residential use

• For the more severe catastrophic events, "demand surge" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and
labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services

    Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for homeowners and
personal lines other, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment
expense reserves.

    Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business, which for statutory reporting purposes is included with the
general liability line of business) over the last nine years has varied from –17% to 3% (averaging –8%) for the Company, and from –7% to
–1% (averaging –4%) for the industry overall. The Company's
year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year
changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    This
line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. While property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year
change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year,
which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the
second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes, including California wildfires in 2017, may take even
longer to resolve.

    The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business) was 1% for 2017, 3% for 2016 and –16% for 2015. The 2017 change
primarily reflected modestly worse than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2014 and 2015. The 2016 change primarily reflected modestly worse than expected loss
experience for liability coverages for accident years 2012 through 2014. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2011
through 2014, and for non-catastrophe weather-related losses and non-weather-related losses for accident year 2014.

International and Other

    International and other includes products written by the Company's international operations, as well as all other products not explicitly
discussed above. The principal component of "other" claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-U.S. exposures, and is runoff
business.

    International
and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the
individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the U.S. statutory reporting framework.

    Due
to changes in the business mix for this line over time, including the 2013 acquisition of Dominion, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively shorter tail (due to both
the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., Canada, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely
long tail (e.g., U.S. excess liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the
specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured
and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity,
due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes.

    International
reserves are generally analyzed by country and general coverage category (e.g., General Liability in Canada, Commercial Property in the United Kingdom, etc.). The
business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage. Where the underlying insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally
similar to those described under the Homeowners, Personal Automobile, Commercial Automobile, General Liability, Commercial Property and Surety discussions above, taking into account differences in the
legal environment and differences in terms and conditions. However, statutory coverage differences exist amongst various jurisdictions. For example, in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy
limits on certain liability coverages.

    Other
reserves, primarily assumed reinsurance in runoff, are generally analyzed by program/pool, treaty type, and general coverage category (e.g., General
Liability—excess of loss reinsurance). Excess exposure requires the insured to "prove" not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess
policy's attachment point.

    Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general
discussion section, and in the Personal Automobile, Homeowners, General Liability, Commercial Property, Commercial Automobile and Surety discussions above) include:

International and other risk factors

• Changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers

148

Table of Contents

• Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision

• Economic trends

• New theories of liability

• Trends in jury awards

• Changes in the propensity to sue

• Changes in statutes of limitations

• Changes in the underlying court system

• Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues

• Changes in tort law

• Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data)

• Changes in foreign currency exchange rates

International and other book of business risk factors

• Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, "claims-made" language)

• Changes in underwriting standards

• Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix)

    Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for International and
other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves. International and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 8% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

    International
and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. Comparative historical information is not available for international product
lines as insurers domiciled outside of the United States do not file U.S. statutory reports. Comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible
one-year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. Accordingly, the Company has not included comparative analyses for International and other.

Reinsurance Recoverables

    Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. The Company evaluates and monitors
the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of
business, the Company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the
Company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and comprehensive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.

    The
Company has entered into a reinsurance contract in connection with a catastrophe bond issued by Long Point Re III. This contract meets the requirements to be accounted for as
reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. The catastrophe bond is described in more detail in "Item 1—Business—Catastrophe
Reinsurance."

149

Table of Contents

    The Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the
Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. Accordingly, the
establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. From time to time, as a
result of the long-tailed nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the Company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts. Changes in estimated
reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges.

    Recoverables
attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the
Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. Recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate
primarily to workers' compensation service business. These recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies' obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company's voluntary
market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. In the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool's or association's
obligations, the other members' share of such obligation increases proportionally.

Investment Valuation and Impairments

Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements

    The Company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value
accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations
when available.

    The
fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties,
i.e., not in a forced transaction. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale,
e.g., a forced transaction. Additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential
that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.

    See
note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the determination of fair value of investments.

Investment Impairments

    See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of investment impairments.

    Due
to the subjective nature of the Company's analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the Company
could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. Additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to
meet contractual obligations may be different than what the Company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods.

We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. We occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers. In March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase.

On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid an additional $4.2 million in connection with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the financial statements).

['s estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value
accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations
when available.

    The
fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties,
i.e., not in a forced transaction. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale,
e.g., a forced transaction. Additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential
that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.

note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the determination of fair value of investments.
