Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," as well as the information contained in "Risk Factors."
Unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Executive Summary
We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories. On December 12, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Pacific Foods of Oregon, LLC (Pacific Foods). The purchase price was $688 million. On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance) for total consideration of $6.112 billion. For additional information on our recent acquisitions, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Commencing in the third quarter of 2018, we formed a new U.S. snacking unit, which combines Snyder's-Lance and Pepperidge Farm, and is an operating segment. As of the third quarter of 2018, we have four operating segments based primarily on product type, and three reportable segments. The U.S. snacking operating segment is aggregated with the international biscuits and snacks operating segment to form the Global Biscuits and Snacks reportable segment. The reportable segments are: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages; Global Biscuits and Snacks; and Campbell Fresh. Through the fourth quarter of 2017, our business in Latin America was managed as part of the Americas Simple Meals and Beverages segment. Beginning in 2018, our business in Latin America is managed as part of the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment. See "Business - Reportable Segments" for a description of the products included in each segment.

Strategy
Based on a recent Board-led strategy and portfolio review, we announced our vision to be a leading snacks and simple meals company, with a portfolio of best-in-class products and brands in our core North American market that we believe will generate sustainable value for our shareholders, customers and consumers. Guided by our purpose - Real food that matters for life’s moments, each of our brands will be driven within a framework of two differentiated portfolio roles:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Drive Profitable Growth. These brands primarily include Cape Cod, Goldfish, Kettle Brand, Lance, Late July, Pace, Pacific, Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse and Milano cookies, Prego and Snyder’s of Hanover, and will be managed to grow disproportionately relative to the categories in which they compete. We believe investments in innovation and consumer engagement will enable these brands to leverage evolving consumer tastes and trends; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maximize Margin and Cash Flow. These brands primarily include Campbell’s soups, Pepperidge Farm fresh bakery, SpaghettiOs and V8, and will be managed with a disciplined focus and aligned investments to support their strong market positions and optimize operating margins and cash flow.

In support of this strategy, we will continue to focus on the integration of Snyder’s-Lance. We also announced plans to pursue the divestiture of businesses within two operating segments: our international biscuits and snacks operating segment, which includes Arnott’s, Kelsen and our operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan; and the Campbell Fresh operating segment, which includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business. The international biscuits and snacks operating segment and the Campbell Fresh operating segment combined represent approximately $2.1 billion in net sales in 2018. We expect to use the proceeds from these divestitures to reduce debt.
As a result of a more focused portfolio, we are pursuing increased multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $945 million by the end of 2022, which includes $295 million in synergies and run-rate cost savings from our acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. We expect to achieve these additional savings by streamlining our organization, expanding our zero-based budgeting efforts and continuing to optimize our manufacturing network. See "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information on these initiatives.
Business Trends
Our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including: changing consumer preferences; a changing retail environment; and significant cost inflation.
Our strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience. For example, consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume. We also expect consumers to continue to seek products that they associate with health and well-being, including naturally functional and organic foods.
Retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms. In 2018, U.S. soup sales declined primarily due to a key customer's different promotional approach for soup. We expect consolidations among retailers will continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. At the same time, new and existing retailers continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products. In addition, although e-commerce represents only a small percentage of total food sales, we anticipate it will continue to grow rapidly.
The cost of distribution has increased due to a significant rise in transportation and logistics costs, driven by excess demand, reduced availability and higher fuel costs. In addition, certain ingredients and packaging required for the manufacture of our products, including steel, have been or may be impacted by new or recently proposed tariffs. We expect these cost pressures to continue in 2019. In connection with our transition to our new U.S. warehouse optimization model, we are also experiencing significantly higher than expected cost increases and shipment delays associated with the startup of our Findlay, Ohio distribution facility. The Findlay facility, operated by a third-party logistics service provider, serves as the Midwest hub for distribution of Campbell’s soups, Swanson broth, V8 beverages and Pace, Prego and Plum products. Additionally, in September, our Maxton, North Carolina manufacturing and distribution capabilities were negatively impacted by flooding associated with Hurricane Florence. We expect the collective impact of these cost increases, shipment delays and weather-related issues to have a negative impact on our results of operations for the first quarter ending October 28, 2018.
Summary of Results
In 2018, we adopted new accounting guidance that changes the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost. Certain amounts in the prior year were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
This Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net sales increased 10% in 2018 to $8.685 billion, primarily due to an 11-point benefit from the acquisitions of Snyder's-Lance and Pacific Foods.

17

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 32.4% from 37.1% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, the dilutive impact of acquisitions, partially offset by productivity improvements.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Administrative expenses increased 19% to $654 million from $550 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher expenses related to cost savings initiatives, the impact of acquisitions, including integration costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Other expenses / (income) increased to expense of $619 million in 2018 from income of $9 million in 2017. The current year included non-cash impairment charges of $737 million on the intangible assets of Campbell Fresh and the Plum trademark, transaction costs of $53 million related to the Snyder's-Lance acquisition, expense of $22 million related to a settlement of a legal claim, and gains of $136 million on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market and curtailment adjustments. The prior year included non-cash impairment charges of $212 million on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and the Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting unit and gains of $178 million on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments. For additional information on the impairment charges, see "Significant Accounting Estimates."

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest expense increased to $201 million from $112 million primarily due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The effective tax rate was 4.0% in 2018, compared to 31.4% in 2017. The current year included a $126 million net tax benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act). See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In 2017, the effective rate reflected a tax benefit of $52 million primarily related to the sale of intercompany notes receivable to a financial institution, which resulted in the recognition of foreign exchange losses on the notes for tax purposes. After adjusting for these items, the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the ongoing lower U.S. federal tax rate as a result of the Act.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Earnings per share were $.86 in 2018, compared to $2.89 a year ago. The current and prior year included expenses of $2.01 and $.15 per share, respectively, from items impacting comparability as discussed below.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Cash flows from operations were $1.305 billion in 2018, compared to $1.291 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower working capital requirements, partially offset by lower cash earnings.

Net Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2018 Compared with 2017
The following items impacted the comparability of earnings and earnings per share:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we recognized gains of $136 million in Other expenses / (income) ($103 million after tax, or $.34 per share) associated with mark-to-market and curtailment adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. In 2017, we recognized gains of $178 million in Other expenses / (income) ($116 million after tax, or $.38 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. In 2017, we expanded these cost savings initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain network, primarily in North America, continuing to evolve our operating model to drive efficiencies, and more fully integrating our recent acquisitions. In January 2018, as part of the expanded initiatives, we authorized additional costs to improve the operational efficiency of our thermal supply chain network in North America by closing our manufacturing facility in Toronto, Ontario, and to optimize our information technology infrastructure by migrating certain applications to the latest cloud technology platform. In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $49 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $88 million in Administrative expenses, $45 million in Cost of products sold, and $3 million in Marketing and selling expenses (aggregate impact of $136 million after tax, or $.45 per share) related to these initiatives. In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $18 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $36 million in Administrative expenses and $4 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $37 million after tax, or $.12 per share) related to these initiatives. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the second quarter of 2018, we announced our intent to acquire Snyder's-Lance and on March 26, 2018, the acquisition closed. In 2018, we incurred $120 million of transaction and integration costs, of which $13 million was recorded in Restructuring charges, $12 million in Administrative expenses, $53 million in Other expenses / (income), and $42 million in Cost of products sold associated with an acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory. We also recorded a gain in Interest expense of $18 million on treasury rate lock contracts used to hedge the planned financing of the acquisition. The aggregate impact was $102 million, $73 million after tax, or $.24 per share;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the fourth quarter of 2018, we performed an impairment assessment on the Plum trademark. In 2018, sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance, we lowered

18

our long-term outlook for future sales. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $54 million ($41 million after tax, or $.14 per share) in Other expenses / (income).
In the third quarter of 2018, we performed interim impairment assessments within Campbell Fresh on the deli reporting unit, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business, and the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. Within the deli unit, we revised our long-term outlook due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with certain private label customers, as well as the recent performance of the business. In addition, the operating performance of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit was below expectations. We revised our long-term outlook for future earnings and cash flows for each of these reporting units. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $11 million on the tangible assets and $94 million on the intangible assets ($80 million after tax, or $.27 per share) of the deli reporting unit, and a non-cash impairment charge of $514 million ($417 million after tax, or $1.39 per share) related to the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit. The aggregate impact of the impairment charges was $619 million, of which $11 million was recorded in Cost of products sold and $608 million in Other expenses / (income), ($497 million after tax, or $1.65 per share).
In the second quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations. We revised our outlook for future earnings and cash flows and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $75 million in Other expenses / (income) ($74 million after tax, or $.25 per share).
In 2018, the total non-cash impairment charges recorded were $748 million, of which $11 million was recorded in Cost of products sold and $737 million in Other expenses / (income), ($612 million after tax, or $2.03 per share).
In the second quarter of 2017, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and the Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting unit as operating performance was well below expectations and a new leadership team of the Campbell Fresh division initiated a strategic review which led to a revised outlook for future sales, earnings, and cash flow. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $147 million ($139 million after tax, or $.45 per share) related to intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and a non-cash impairment charge of $65 million ($41 million after tax, or $.13 per share) related to the intangible assets of the Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting unit (aggregate pre-tax impact of $212 million, $180 million after tax, or $.59 per share). The charges were included in Other expenses / (income). See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we recorded expense of $22 million in Other expenses / (income) ($15 million after tax, or $.05 per share) from a settlement of a legal claim;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we reflected the impact on taxes of the enactment of the Act that was signed into law in December 2017. We recorded a tax benefit of $179 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a tax charge of $53 million related to a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings. The net impact was a tax benefit of $126 million ($.42 per share). See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Taxes on Earnings" for additional information; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2017, we recorded a tax benefit of $52 million in Taxes on earnings primarily related to the sale of intercompany notes receivable to a financial institution, which resulted in the recognition of foreign exchange losses on the notes for tax purposes. In addition, we recorded a $6 million reduction to interest expense ($4 million after tax) related to premiums and fees received on the sale of the notes. The aggregate impact was $56 million after tax, or $.18 per share. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Net earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company were $261 million ($0.86 per share) in 2018, compared to $887 million ($2.89 per share) in 2017. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, earnings decreased primarily due to declines on the base business reflecting a lower gross profit performance, and the dilutive impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, reflecting share repurchases. We suspended our share repurchases as of the second quarter of 2018.
Net Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2017 Compared with 2016
In addition to the 2017 items that impacted comparability of Net earnings discussed above, the following items impacted the comparability of earnings and earnings per share:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2016, we recognized losses of $313 million in Other expenses / (income) ($200 million after tax, or $.64 per share) associated with mark-to-market adjustments for defined benefit pension and postretirement plans;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $35 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $47 million in Administrative expenses related to the 2015 initiatives. In 2016, we also recorded a reduction to pre-tax restructuring charges of $4 million related to the 2014 initiatives. The aggregate after-tax impact in 2016 of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs was $49 million, or $.16 per share. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of the annual review of intangible assets, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $141 million ($127 million after tax, or $.41 per share) related to the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit. The charges are included in Other expenses / (income); and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2016, we recorded a gain of $25 million ($.08 per share) in Other expenses / (income) from a settlement of a claim related to the Kelsen acquisition. The claim was for a warranty breach and has no meaningful ongoing impact on Kelsen.

In 2018, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages sales decreased 1% primarily due to declines in U.S. soup and V8 beverages, partially offset by the benefit of the acquisition of Pacific Foods, and an increase in the retail business in Canada driven by the favorable impact of currency translation. Excluding Pacific Foods, sales of U.S. soup declined 8%, driven by declines in condensed soups, ready-to-serve soups and broth. The decline in U.S. soup was primarily due to a key customer’s different promotional approach for soup in 2018.
In 2017, Americas Simple Meals and Beverages sales decreased 1% primarily due to declines in V8 beverages and soup, partly offset by gains in Prego pasta sauces and SpaghettiOs pasta. U.S. soup sales decreased 1% due to declines in condensed soups and broth, partly offset by gains in ready-to-serve soups. Gains in ready-to-serve soups were primarily driven by Chunky soups due to improved execution, including merchandising and dedicated advertising, as well as new items, and the launch of Well Yes! soups. Promotional spending had a negative impact of 1% on sales, with increases on broth, in Canada and on V8 beverages. We increased promotional spending on broth and V8 beverages to remain competitive, and in Canada to hold certain promoted prices following list price increases.

21

In 2018, Global Biscuits and Snacks sales increased 31% primarily due to the 29-point benefit of the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance. Excluding Snyder’s-Lance and the favorable impact of currency translation, sales increased primarily due to gains in Pepperidge Farm, reflecting growth in Goldfish crackers and in cookies, as well as gains of Kelsen cookies in China, partially offset by declines in Arnott’s biscuits, primarily in Indonesia.
In 2017, Global Biscuits and Snacks sales increased 1% reflecting a 1% favorable impact from currency translation. Excluding the favorable impact of currency translation, segment sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in Pepperidge Farm were offset by declines in Kelsen, mostly in the U.S., and in Arnott's in Indonesia. Pepperidge Farm sales increased due to gains in Goldfish crackers and in cookies, benefiting from new items, partly offset by declines in fresh bakery and frozen products.
In 2018, Campbell Fresh sales were comparable to the prior year as gains in carrot ingredients and Garden Fresh Gourmet were offset by declines in Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages.
In 2017, Campbell Fresh sales decreased 5% primarily due to lower sales of refrigerated beverages and carrots, partly offset by gains in refrigerated soup. The decrease in refrigerated beverages reflects the adverse impact of supply constraints related to enhanced quality processes following the voluntary recall of Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks in June 2016. The carrot sales performance reflects the market share impact of quality and execution issues experienced in 2016, as well as the adverse impact of weather conditions in the second quarter of 2017.
Gross Profit
Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, decreased by $109 million in 2018 from 2017 and decreased by $3 million in 2017 from 2016. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 32.4% in 2018, 37.1% in 2017 and 36.8% in 2016.
The 4.7 percentage-point decrease in gross profit percentage in 2018 and 0.3 percentage-point increase in gross profit percentage in 2017 were due to the following factors:

(1) 2018 includes a positive margin impact of 0.9 from cost savings initiatives, which was more than offset by cost inflation and other factors, including higher transportation and logistics costs and higher costs in Campbell Fresh. 2017 includes a positive margin impact of 1 from cost savings initiatives.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) 2018 includes a negative margin impact of 0.5 from a Snyder's-Lance acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory.

Marketing and Selling Expenses
Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 10.4% in 2018, 10.8% in 2017 and 10.7% in 2016. Marketing and selling expenses increased 5% in 2018 from 2017. The increase was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions (approximately 9 percentage points) and investments in e-commerce (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 2 percentage points); lower marketing overhead expenses (approximately 1 percentage point); lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 1 percentage point) and lower incentive compensation costs (approximately 1 percentage point).
Marketing and selling expenses were comparable in 2017 and 2016 as increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 2 percentage points); and lower incentive compensation costs (approximately 1 percentage point) were offset by higher selling expenses (approximately 1 percentage point) and inflation (approximately 1 percentage point).
Administrative Expenses
Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.5% in 2018, 7.0% in 2017 and 7.2% in 2016. Administrative expenses increased 19% in 2018 from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher costs related to cost savings initiatives (approximately 9 percentage points); the impact of acquisitions (approximately 7 percentage points); acquisition integration costs (approximately 2 percentage points); consulting costs incurred in connection with the strategic review (approximately 1 percentage point);

22

investments in long-term innovation (approximately 1 percentage point); the impact of currency translation (approximately 1 percentage point) and inflation and other factors (approximately 4 percentage points), partially offset by lower incentive compensation (approximately 5 percentage points) and increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 1 percentage point).
Administrative expenses decreased 4% in 2017 from 2016. The decrease was primarily due to increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points); lower incentive compensation costs (approximately 3 percentage points); and lower costs related to cost savings initiatives (approximately 2 percentage points), partially offset by inflation (approximately 2 percentage points) and investments in long-term innovation (approximately 1 percentage point).
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses decreased $1 million, or 1%, in 2018 from 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower investments in long-term innovation (approximately 3 percentage points); and lower incentive compensation costs (approximately 2 percentage points), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions (approximately 3 percentage points) and inflation and other factors (approximately 1 percentage point).
Research and development expenses increased $6 million, or 6%, in 2017 from 2016. The increase was primarily due to inflation and other factors (approximately 8 percentage points) and investments in long-term innovation (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 2 percentage points) and lower incentive compensation costs (approximately 2 percentage points).

Operating earnings from Americas Simple Meals and Beverages decreased 12% in 2018 versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage and lower sales volume, partly offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit performance was impacted by cost inflation, including higher transportation and logistics costs, and the dilutive impact from the acquisition of Pacific Foods.
Operating earnings from Americas Simple Meals and Beverages increased 5% in 2017 versus 2016. The increase was primarily due to a higher gross profit percentage, benefiting from productivity improvements, and lower administrative expenses, partly offset by volume declines.
Operating earnings from Global Biscuits and Snacks increased 17% in 2018 versus 2017. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance, higher organic sales volume and lower marketing and selling expenses, partly offset by a lower gross profit percentage. Gross profit performance was impacted by higher levels of cost inflation, particularly on butter, higher transportation and logistics costs and costs associated with the voluntary product recall of flavor-blasted Goldfish crackers in July 2018.
Operating earnings from Global Biscuits and Snacks increased 7% in 2017 versus 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses, lower marketing and selling expenses and higher sales voume.
Operating earnings from Campbell Fresh decreased from a loss of $9 million in 2017 to a loss of $43 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage, reflecting higher supply chain costs including lower manufacturing efficiencies and cost inflation, as well as higher carrot costs attributable to the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields.
Operating earnings from Campbell Fresh decreased from $60 million in 2016 to a loss of $9 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable mix; higher carrot costs, which were partly associated with the adverse impact on crop yields of heavy rains in December and January of fiscal 2017, as well as excess organic carrots; the cost impact of both lower beverage operating efficiencies and enhanced quality processes; and higher administrative expenses.
Corporate in 2018 included the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• non-cash impairment charges of $748 million related to the assets of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit, the deli reporting unit, the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrots ingredients reporting unit and the Plum trademark;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• transaction and integration costs of $107 million associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance;

- --------------------------------------------------------------
• costs of $136 million related to the cost savings initiatives;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• $22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $136 million of gains on pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market and curtailment adjustments.

Corporate in 2017 included non-cash impairment charges of $212 million on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and the Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting unit, costs of $40 million related to cost savings initiatives and a $178 million gain associated with pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments. Excluding these amounts, the remaining decrease in costs was primarily due to higher pension and postretirement benefit income in 2018, and lower incentive compensation costs, partially offset by higher administrative expenses and losses on open commodity contracts in the current year.
Corporate in 2016 included a $313 million loss associated with pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market adjustments, a non-cash impairment charge of $141 million on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting

24

unit, costs of $47 million related to cost savings initiatives, and a $25 million gain from a settlement of a claim related to the Kelsen acquisition. The remaining decrease in 2017 was primarily due to lower postretirement benefit costs as a result of amortization of prior service credit, partially offset by investments in long-term innovation.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased to $201 million in 2018 from $112 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense was due to higher levels of debt associated with funding the acquisitions and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio, partially offset by a gain of $18 million on treasury rate lock contracts used to hedge the planned financing of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition.
Interest expense decreased to $112 million in 2017 from $115 million in 2016. In 2017, we recorded a $6 million reduction to interest expense related to premiums and fees received from the sale of intercompany notes receivable to a financial institution. Excluding the premium and fees, interest expense increased reflecting higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio, partially offset by lower average levels of debt.
Taxes on Earnings
The effective tax rate was 4.0% in 2018, 31.4% in 2017 and 33.7% in 2016.
On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation. As a result, the following items are reflected in 2018:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The corporate rate reduction as of January 1, 2018, resulted in a blended U.S. statutory tax rate of approximately 27%;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a tax benefit of $179 million; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Imposition of a transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings resulted in a tax charge of $53 million.

The amounts recorded represent provisional amounts based on our best estimates and current interpretation of the provisions of the Act and may change as additional guidance is issued. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Tax expense decreased from $406 million in 2017 to $11 million in 2018.
The following items impacted 2018 and 2017:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we recognized tax expense of $33 million on $136 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market and curtailment gains. In 2017, we recognized a tax expense of $62 million on $178 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market gains;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we recognized a $49 million tax benefit on $185 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs. In 2017, we recognized a $21 million tax benefit on $58 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we recognized a $29 million tax benefit on $102 million of transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we recognized a $136 million tax benefit on the $748 million impairment charges on the assets of the deli reporting unit, the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit, the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and the Plum trademark. In 2017, we recognized a $32 million tax benefit on the $212 million impairment charges on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit and the Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting unit;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we recognized a $7 million tax benefit on the $22 million of expense related to the settlement of a legal claim;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $126 million related to the enactment of the Act on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings described above; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2017, we recognized a tax benefit of $52 million primarily related to the sale of intercompany notes receivable to a financial institution, which resulted in the recognition of foreign exchange losses on the notes for tax purposes.

After adjusting for the items above, the remaining decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the ongoing benefit of the lower U.S. federal tax rate as a result of the Act.
The following items impacted the tax rate in 2016:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2016, we recognized a tax benefit of $113 million on $313 million of pension and postretirement benefit mark-to-market losses;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2016, we recognized a $14 million tax benefit on the $141 million impairment charge on the intangible assets associated with the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit;

25

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2016, we recognized a $29 million tax benefit on $78 million of restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In 2016, the $25 million gain from a settlement of a claim related to the Kelsen acquisition was not subject to tax.

In addition, in 2017 the effective rate was favorably impacted by the recognition of $6 million of excess tax benefits in connection with the adoption of new accounting guidance on stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2017.
Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives
2015 Initiatives
In fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. As part of these initiatives, we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain U.S.-based salaried employees nearing retirement who met age, length-of-service and business unit/function criteria.
In February 2017, we announced that we were expanding these initiatives by further optimizing our supply chain network, primarily in North America, continuing to evolve our operating model to drive efficiencies, and more fully integrating our recent acquisitions. In January 2018, as part of the expanded initiatives, we authorized additional pre-tax costs to improve the operational efficiency of our thermal supply chain network in North America by closing our manufacturing facility in Toronto, Ontario, and to optimize our information technology infrastructure by migrating certain applications to the latest cloud technology platform. In August 2018, we announced that we will continue to streamline our organization, expand our zero-based budgeting efforts and optimize our manufacturing network. We extended the time horizon for the initiatives to 2022. Cost estimates for these expanded initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.
A summary of the restructuring charges and charges recorded in Administrative expenses, Cost of products sold, and Marketing and selling expenses related to the initiatives is as follows:

------------------------------------ ---- --- ---- -- ---- --- ---- - --- - ---

(Millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 2016 2015
Restructuring charges $ 49 $ 18 $ 35 $ 102
Administrative expenses 88 36 47 22
Cost of products sold 45 4 — —
Marketing and selling expenses 3 — — —
Total pre-tax charges $ 185 $ 58 $ 82 $ 124

Aggregate after-tax impact $ 136 $ 37 $ 52 $ 78
Per share impact $ .45 $ .12 $ .17 $ .25

A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the initiatives is as follows:

-------------------------------------------- ------------------------------ ---

(Millions) Recognized as of July 29, 2018
Severance pay and benefits $ 180
Asset impairment/accelerated depreciation 45
Implementation costs and other related costs 224
Total $ 449

The total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified are approximately $570 million to $605 million. This estimate will be updated as costs for the expanded initiatives are developed.
We expect the costs for actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $195 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $95 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $280 million to $315 million in implementation costs and other related costs.We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages - approximately 45%; Global Biscuits and Snacks - approximately 30%; Campbell Fresh - approximately 3%; and Corporate - approximately 22%.
Of the aggregate $570 million to $605 million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect approximately $465 million to $500 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $250 million in capital expenditures through 2020 primarily related to the U.S. warehouse optimization project, transition of production of the Toronto manufacturing facility to our U.S. thermal plants, insourcing of manufacturing for certain simple meal products and optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications, of which we invested approximately $114 million as of July 29, 2018.

26

We expect to incur the costs for the actions that have been identified to date through 2020 and to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.
We expect the initiatives for actions that have been identified to date to generate pre-tax savings of $470 million in 2019, and once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $650 million by the end of 2022. The annual pre-tax savings generated by the initiatives were as follows:

--------------------- ---- --- ---- ---- --- ---- - --- - --

(Millions) 2018 2017 2016 2015
Total pre-tax savings $ 420 $ 325 $ 215 $ 85

Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. A summary of the pre-tax costs incurred to date associated with segments is as follows:

----------------------------------- ---- --- ---------------------- --- - ---

(Millions) 2018 Costs Incurred to Date
Americas Simple Meals and Beverages $ 86 $ 178
Global Biscuits and Snacks 73 151
Campbell Fresh 5 11
Corporate 21 109
Total $ 185 $ 449

Snyder's-Lance Cost Transformation Program and Integration
On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, in April 2017, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We expect to continue to implement this program and to achieve a majority of the program's targeted savings. In addition, we have identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrate Snyder's-Lance.
We are developing the detailed plans to implement the Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and to achieve the cost synergies and therefore we cannot reasonably estimate the total expected pre-tax costs and timing of when we expect to incur those costs, as well as the expected future cash expenditures. We expect the pre-tax costs to be associated primarily with Global Biscuits and Snacks.
In 2018, we recorded a restructuring charge of $13 million and incurred $12 million in Administrative expenses related to the integration of Snyder's-Lance.
We expect the Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration to generate pre-tax annual savings of $105 million in 2019, and once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $295 million beginning in 2022. In 2018, pre-tax savings were $35 million.
Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges, nor implementation and integration costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. The pre-tax costs of $25 million incurred in 2018 were associated with the Global Biscuits and Snacks segment.
2015 Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance Cost Transformation Program and Integration
We generated annual pre-tax savings of $455 million in 2018 for both programs and expect once all phases of these programs are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $945 million by the end of 2022.
2014 Initiatives
In 2014, we implemented initiatives to reduce overhead across the organization, restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for our soup and broth business in China and improve supply chain efficiency in Australia.
 In 2016, we recorded a reduction to restructuring charges of $4 million ($3 million after tax, or $.01 per share) related to the 2014 initiatives. As of July 31, 2016, we incurred substantially all of the costs related to the 2014 initiatives.

27

A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the 2014 initiatives is as follows:

-------------------------- ---------------- -- ------------------ - ------------------------------ -- -- - --

(Millions) Total Program(1) Change in Estimate Recognized as of July 31, 2016
Severance pay and benefits $ 41 $ (4 ) $ 37

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, including commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.
We generated cash flows from operations of $1.305 billion in 2018, compared to $1.291 billion in 2017. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to lower working capital requirements, partially offset by lower cash earnings.
We generated cash flows from operations of $1.291 billion in 2017, compared to $1.491 billion in 2016. The decline in 2017 was primarily due to lapping significant reductions in working capital in 2016, as well as lower cash earnings and lower receipts from hedging activities in 2017.
Current assets are less than current liabilities as a result of our level of current maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings and our focus to lower core working capital requirements by reducing trade receivables and inventories while extending payment terms for accounts payables. We had negative working capital of $1.298 billion as of July 29, 2018, and $495 million as of July 30, 2017. Debt maturing within one year was $1.896 billion as of July 29, 2018, and $1.037 billion as of July 30, 2017.
Capital expenditures were $407 million in 2018, $338 million in 2017 and $341 million in 2016. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $400 million in 2019. Capital expenditures in 2018 included a U.S. warehouse optimization project (approximately $50 million); transition of production of the Toronto manufacturing facility to our U.S. thermal plants (approximately $23 million); insourcing manufacturing for certain simple meal products (approximately $18 million); replacement of a Pepperidge Farm refrigeration system (approximately $9 million); and an Australian multi-pack biscuit capacity expansion project (approximately $2 million). Capital expenditures in 2017 included projects to expand: Australian multi-pack biscuit capacity (approximately $15 million); beverage and salad dressing capacity at Bolthouse Farms (approximately $8 million); and capacity at Garden Fresh (approximately $3 million); as well as the continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters (approximately $11 million); replacement of a Pepperidge Farm refrigeration system (approximately $12 million); and a U.S. warehouse optimization project (approximately $10 million). Capital expenditures in 2016 included projects to expand: beverage and salad dressing capacity at Bolthouse Farms (approximately $22 million); biscuit capacity in Indonesia (approximately $11 million); warehouse capacity in North America (approximately $11 million); cracker capacity at Pepperidge Farm (approximately $9 million); and capacity in Malaysia (approximately $6 million); as well as the continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters (approximately $15 million) and the ongoing initiative to simplify the soup-making process in North America (approximately $5 million).
On December 12, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Pacific Foods. The purchase price was $688 million and was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.
On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance. Total consideration was $6.112 billion, which included the payoff of approximately $1.1 billion of Snyder's-Lance indebtedness. We borrowed $900 million under a single draw 3-year senior unsecured term loan facility on March 26, 2018, and issued $5.3 billion senior notes on March 16, 2018, to finance the acquisition. The interest rate on the senior unsecured term loan facility resets in one, two, three, or six-month periods dependent upon our election. Interest on the senior unsecured term loan facility is due upon the earlier of an interest reset or quarterly and the first interest payment is due in June 2018. The senior unsecured term loan facility may be prepaid at par at any time. The senior unsecured term loan facility contains customary covenants and events of default for credit facilities of this type.
The $5.3 billion senior notes were issued in various tenors in both fixed and floating rate formats. We issued 2 and 3-year floating rate senior notes in the amount of $500 million and $400 million, respectively. We issued 3, 5, 7, 10, and 30-year fixed rate senior notes in the amount of $650 million, $1.2 billion, $850 million, $1 billion, and $700 million, respectively. Interest on the 2-year floating rate senior notes is due quarterly on March 16, June 16, September 16, and December 16, commencing on

28

June 16, 2018. Interest on the 3-year floating rate senior notes is due quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15, commencing on June 15, 2018. Interest on the fixed rate senior notes is due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, commencing on September 15, 2018. The fixed rate senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at our option at any time at the applicable redemption price. If change of control triggering events occur, we will be required to offer to purchase the senior notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. The senior notes were issued under a shelf registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July 2017. We registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement, we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions.
In June 2017, we sold intercompany notes to a financial institution, including an AUD $280 million, or $224 million, note with an interest rate of 4.88% that matures on September 18, 2018, and an AUD $190 million, or $152 million, note with an interest rate of 6.98% that matures on March 29, 2021, but is payable upon demand. Interest on both notes is due semi-annually on January 23 and July 23. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. On September 18, 2018, we repaid a portion of both Australian notes and refinanced the remainder with a new AUD $400 million, or $296 million, single-draw syndicated facility that matures on September 11, 2019. The interest rate on the new facility is floating based on an Australian dollar rate for the applicable interest period plus a margin. The interest period resets in one, two, three or six-month periods, based on our election. The facility contains customary covenants and events of default for credit facilities of this type.
Dividend payments were $426 million in 2018, $420 million in 2017 and $390 million in 2016. Annual dividends declared were $1.40 per share in 2018 and 2017, and $1.248 per share in 2016. The 2018 fourth quarter dividend was $.35 per share.
We repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a cost of $86 million in 2018, approximately 8 million shares at a cost of $437 million in 2017, and approximately 3 million shares at a cost of $143 million in 2016. As a result of the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, we suspended our share repurchases as of the second quarter of 2018. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
As of July 29, 2018, we had $1.896 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $1.14 billion was comprised of commercial paper borrowings, $348 million of Australian notes and $300 million of 4.5% notes. On September 18, 2018, we repaid a portion of the Australian notes and refinanced the remainder with a new AUD $400 million single-draw syndicated facility that matures on September 18, 2019. As of July 29, 2018, we issued $59 million of standby letters of credit. We have a committed revolving credit facility totaling $1.85 billion that matures in December 2021. This U.S. facility remained unused at July 29, 2018, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. The U.S. facility supports our commercial paper programs and other general corporate purposes. As of July 29, 2018, the total commitment under a Canadian committed revolving credit facility was CAD $125 million, or $96 million, and we had borrowings of CAD $117 million, or $90 million, at a rate of 3.17% under this facility. The Canadian facility supports general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements.
Our credit ratings were recently downgraded by Standard & Poor's and reaffirmed with a negative outlook by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. If our credit ratings are further downgraded, we may have difficulty selling additional debt securities or borrowing money in the amounts and on the terms that might be available if our credit ratings were maintained.
We are in compliance with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facilities and debt securities.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments
We guarantee approximately 2,000 bank loans made to Pepperidge Farm independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $210 million. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.
With the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance, we guarantee approximately 2,400 bank loans made to independent business owners by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The outstanding aggregate balance on these loans was $187 million as of July 29, 2018. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.
 See also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements.

INFLATION
We are exposed to the impact of inflation on our cost of products sold. We use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY
The principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for 19% of 2018 net sales, are concentrated principally in Australia and Canada. We manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. We enter into cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments.
We principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of soybean oil, wheat, diesel fuel, aluminum, natural gas, soybean meal, corn, cocoa, butter, and cheese, which impact the cost of raw materials.
The information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of July 29, 2018. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 12, 13 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of July 30, 2017, fixed-rate debt of approximately $2.534 billion with an average interest rate of 4.37% and variable-rate debt of approximately $1.014 billion with an average interest rate of 1.44% were outstanding. As of July 30, 2017, forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $300 million were outstanding. The average rate to be received on these swaps was 2.27%, and the average rate to be paid was estimated to be 3.09% over the remaining life of the swaps. For the swaps, variable rates are the weighted-average forward rates for the term of each contract.
We are exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiary debt. We utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The following table summarizes the foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding and the related weighted-average contract exchange rates as of July 29, 2018.

We had an additional number of smaller contracts to purchase or sell various other currencies with a notional value of $14 million as of July 29, 2018. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a gain of $2 million as of July 29, 2018. The total notional value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding was $420 million, and the aggregate fair value was a loss of $18 million as of July 30, 2017.
We enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. As of July 29, 2018, the notional value of these contracts was $118 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $1 million. As of July 30, 2017, the notional value of these contracts was $90 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $5 million.
We enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index, and the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. Under these contracts, we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either: the total return on our capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index; or the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was $8 million at July 29, 2018, and $9 million at July 30, 2017. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in April 2019, was 2.97% at July 29, 2018. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was $23 million at July 29, 2018, and $26 million at July 30, 2017. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in March 2019, was 2.97% at July 29, 2018. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index was $10 million at July 29, 2018, and $8 million at July 30, 2017. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in March 2019, was 2.60% at July 29, 2018. As of July 29, 2018 and July 30, 2017, the fair value of these contracts was a gain of $1 million.

Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:
Trade and consumer promotion programs — We offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. The mix between promotion programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates.
Valuation of long-lived assets — Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. In January 2017, the FASB issued revised guidance that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2017. Under the revised guidance, if a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the reporting unit to fair value. Prior to the revised guidance, the amount of the impairment was the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the "implied" fair value, which was calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value.
2016 Assessments
In the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $106 million on goodwill and $35 million on a trademark within the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit, which is included in the Campbell Fresh segment. In 2016, carrot performance primarily reflected the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields, and execution issues in response to those conditions, which led to customer dissatisfaction, a loss of business, and higher carrot costs in the second half of the year. The impairment was attributable to a decline in profitability in the second half of 2016 and a revised outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for sales, operating margins, and discounted cash flows.
2017 Assessments
During the second quarter of 2017, sales and operating profit performance for Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients were well below our expectations due to difficulty with regaining market share lost during 2016 and higher carrot costs from the adverse impact of heavy rains on crop yields. During the quarter, we also lowered our forecast for sales and earnings for the reporting unit for the second half of 2017 based on revised market share recovery expectations and the continuing effect of unusual

32

weather conditions on carrot costs. In addition, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of Campbell Fresh during the second quarter, we decided to reduce emphasis on growing sales of carrot ingredients, which are a by-product of the manufacturing process, and to manage carrots sold at retail for modest sales growth consistent with the category while improving profitability. Accordingly, we reduced our expectations for recovery of retail carrot market share. As a consequence of the business performance and the strategic review, we lowered our sales outlook for future fiscal years.We also lowered our average margin expectations due in part to cost volatility, which has been higher than expected. Based upon the business performance in the second quarter of 2017, our reduced near-term outlook, and reduced expectations for sales, operating margins and discounted cash flows, we performed an interim impairment assessment in the second quarter, which resulted in a $127 million impairment charge on goodwill and $20 million on a trademark in the reporting unit.
We acquired Garden Fresh Gourmet on June 29, 2015. During 2017, sales and operating profit performance for Garden Fresh Gourmet, a reporting unit within the Campbell Fresh segment, were well below expectations, and we lowered our outlook for the second half of 2017 due to customer losses and failure to meet product distribution goals. We expected to expand distribution of salsa beyond our concentration in the Midwest region, however this proved to be challenging as differentiated recipes are required to meet taste profiles in other parts of the country. In addition, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team of Campbell Fresh during the second quarter, we lowered our distribution and category growth expectations and, therefore, future sales outlook. Based upon the business performance in 2017, our reduced near-term outlook, and reduced expectations for sales, operating margins and discounted cash flows, we performed an interim impairment assessment in the second quarter, which resulted in a $64 million impairment charge on goodwill and $1 million on a trademark in the reporting unit.
2018 Assessments
During the second quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit as operating performance was below expectations. The business was impacted by adverse weather conditions and the implementation of enhanced quality protocols, which impacted crop yields and resulted in higher costs. This cost volatility continued to be higher than expected and caused us to reassess our short- and long-term margin expectations for this business. Based on this performance, we reduced our outlook for future operating margins and discounted cash flows, which resulted in a $75 million impairment charge, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit. The fair value of the trademark exceeded the carrying value, which was $48 million.
During the third quarter of 2018, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the deli reporting unit, which includes Garden Fresh Gourmet and the U.S. refrigerated soup business within Campbell Fresh. During the third quarter of 2018, certain of our private label refrigerated soup customers, which represent a majority of the business, informed us of their intention to in-source production beginning in 2019, and the sales and operating profit outlook of the Garden Fresh Gourmet business was reduced. Due to the anticipated loss of refrigerated soup business with these customers, as well as the recent performance of the Garden Fresh Gourmet business, we revised the long-term outlook for future sales, operating margins and discounted cash flows for this reporting unit, which resulted in an $81 million impairment charge on goodwill, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit, $13 million on a trademark, and $11 million on plant assets in the reporting unit.
In addition, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the intangible assets of the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit within the Campbell Fresh segment as the operating performance in the third quarter was below expectations. We assessed sales performance of refrigerated beverages and key drivers impacting gross profit for the unit. We revised our long-term outlook for future earnings and discounted cash flows to reflect reduced sales expectations to modest growth and decreased our gross profit outlook to reflect the inflation and manufacturing efficiency pressures that remain with the unit. This revised outlook resulted in a $384 million impairment charge on goodwill, representing a write-down of the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit, and $130 million on a trademark in the reporting unit.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $54 million on the Plum trademark. In 2018, sales and operating performance were well below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2018, as part of a strategic review initiated by a new leadership team and based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook for future sales.
As of July 29, 2018, the carrying value of goodwill was $4.58 billion. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2018 fair value measurement constant, a 1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital assumption would not reduce fair value of any of the reporting units below carrying value and would not result any impairment charges.
As of July 29, 2018, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $3.123 billion, of which $48 million related to the Bolthouse Farms carrot and carrot ingredients reporting unit, $150 million related to the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and salad dressings reporting unit, $23 million related to the Garden Fresh Gourmet trademark, and $61 million related to the Plum trademark. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2018 fair value measurement constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately:

33

--------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------- - ---------------------------------------------------------- -------------------- --- ---- - -- - - --- -

(Millions) Bolthouse Farms Carrot and Carrot Ingredients Bolthouse Farms Refrigerated Beverages and Salad Dressings Garden Fresh Gourmet Plum
1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital $ — $ (30 ) $ (5 ) $ (10 )
1% reduction in revenue growth $ — $ (20 ) $ — $ (5 )

The carrying value of the Pace trademark was $292 million as of July 29, 2018, and the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by less than 10%. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2018 fair value measurement of the Pace trademark constant, a 1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital assumption would result in an impairment charge of approximately $30 million, and a 1% reduction in the revenue growth assumption would result in an impairment charge of approximately $10 million.
The carrying value of trademarks of $280 million associated with the Pacific Foods acquisition and $2.131 billion associated with the Snyder's-Lance acquisition represents fair value. Holding all other assumptions used in the acquisition valuation measurement constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of the these trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately:

--------------------------------------------------- ------------- --- ---------------------- - ---- -

(Millions) Pacific Foods Various Snyder's-Lance
1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital $ (40 ) $ (270 )
1% reduction in revenue growth $ (20 ) $ (135 )

For the remaining balance of our other trademarks, holding all other assumptions used in the 2018 fair value measurement constant, neither a 1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital assumption nor a 1% reduction in the revenue growth assumption would result in any material impairment.
The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.
If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential additional impairment charges could result. We will continue to monitor the valuation of our long-lived assets.
See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.
Pension and postretirement benefits — We provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense.
The discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. Beginning in 2018, we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense (income). We elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change did not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations. We accounted for this change prospectively in 2018 as a change in accounting estimate. As a result of this change, net periodic benefit income increased by approximately $17 million in 2018, compared to what the net periodic benefit income would have been under the previous method.
The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date.

34

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense (income) was $(185) million in 2018, $(258) million in 2017 and $317 million in 2016.
Significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:

------------------------------------- ----- ----- -----

 2018 2017 2016
Pension
Discount rate for benefit obligations 4.15% 3.74% 3.39%
Expected return on plan assets 6.86% 6.84% 7.09%
Postretirement
Discount rate for obligations 4.06% 3.45% 3.20%
Initial health care trend rate 6.75% 7.25% 7.25%
Ultimate health care trend rate 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%

Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately $6 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately $122 million. A 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $10 million. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would not result in an immediate loss.
No contributions were made to U.S. pension plans in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Contributions to non-U.S. plans were $5 million in 2018 and 2017, and $2 million in 2016. We do not expect to contribute to the U.S. pension plans in 2019. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $4 million in 2019.
See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits.
Income taxes — The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and transitioning to a territorial system for taxation on foreign earnings along with the imposition of a transition tax in 2018 on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings.
See also Notes 1 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements. Future minimum lease payments due to Conrail under the shared asset area agreements are shown in the table below. --------------------- --------------- --- (Dollars in Millions) Conrail Shared Years Asset Agreement 2018 $ 27 2019 27 2020 27 2021 27 2022 27 Thereafter 48 Total $ 183 Also, included in equity earnings of affiliates are CSX's 42 percent share of Conrail's income and its amortization of the fair value write-up arising from the acquisition of Conrail and certain other adjustments. The amortization primarily represents the additional after-tax depreciation expense related to the write-up of Conrail's fixed assets when the original purchase price, from the 1997 acquisition of Conrail, was allocated based on fair value. This write-up of fixed assets resulted in a difference between CSX's investment in Conrail and its share of Conrail's underlying net equity, which is $347 million as of December 2017.

Operating earnings from Americas Simple Meals and Beverages decreased 12% in 2018 versus 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage and lower sales volume, partly offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit performance was impacted by cost inflation, including higher transportation and logistics costs, and the dilutive impact from the acquisition of Pacific Foods.
Operating earnings from Americas Simple Meals and Beverages increased 5% in 2017 versus 2016. The increase was primarily due to a higher gross profit percentage, benefiting from productivity improvements, and lower administrative expenses, partly offset by volume declines.
Operating earnings from Global Biscuits and Snacks increased 17% in 2018 versus 2017. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance, higher organic sales volume and lower marketing and selling expenses, partly offset by a lower gross profit percentage. Gross profit performance was impacted by higher levels of cost inflation, particularly on butter, higher transportation and logistics costs and costs associated with the voluntary product recall of flavor-blasted Goldfish crackers in July 2018.
Operating earnings from Global Biscuits and Snacks increased 7% in 2017 versus 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses, lower marketing and selling expenses and higher sales voume.
Operating earnings from Campbell Fresh decreased from a loss of $9 million in 2017 to a loss of $43 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross profit percentage, reflecting higher supply chain costs including lower manufacturing efficiencies and cost inflation, as well as higher carrot costs attributable to the adverse impact of weather conditions on crop yields.
Operating earnings from Campbell Fresh decreased from $60 million in 2016 to a loss of $9 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable mix; higher carrot costs, which were partly associated with the adverse impact on crop yields of heavy rains in December and January of fiscal 2017, as well as excess organic carrots; the cost impact of both lower beverage operating efficiencies and enhanced quality processes; and higher administrative expenses.

1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital $ (40 ) $ (270 )
1% reduction in revenue growth $ (20 ) $ (135 )

For the remaining balance of our other trademarks, holding all other assumptions used in the 2018 fair value measurement constant, neither a 1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital assumption nor a 1% reduction in the revenue growth assumption would result in any material impairment.
The estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions.
If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential additional impairment charges could result. We will continue to monitor the valuation of our long-lived assets.
See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.
Pension and postretirement benefits — We provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense.
The discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. Beginning in 2018, we changed the method we used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense (income). We elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. This change did not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations. We accounted for this change prospectively in 2018 as a change in accounting estimate. As a result of this change, net periodic benefit income increased by approximately $17 million in 2018, compared to what the net periodic benefit income would have been under the previous method.
The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date.

Net periodic pension and postretirement expense (income) was $(185) million in 2018, $(258) million in 2017 and $317 million in 2016.

Expected return on plan assets 6.86% 6.84% 7.09%
Postretirement
Discount rate for obligations 4.06% 3.45% 3.20%
Initial health care trend rate 6.75% 7.25% 7.25%
Ultimate health care trend rate 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%

Estimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would decrease expense by approximately $6 million and would result in an immediate loss recognition of approximately $122 million. A 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $10 million. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would have no impact on postretirement service and interest cost and would not result in an immediate loss.
No contributions were made to U.S. pension plans in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Contributions to non-U.S. plans were $5 million in 2018 and 2017, and $2 million in 2016. We do not expect to contribute to the U.S. pension plans in 2019. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $4 million in 2019.

Income taxes — The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted into law and made significant changes to corporate taxation, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and transitioning to a territorial system for taxation on foreign earnings along with the imposition of a transition tax in 2018 on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings.
