and manage complex cloud environments.
We market and license our solutions through multiple channels worldwide, including selling through resellers and direct over the Web. Our partner community comprises thousands of value-added resellers, or VARs known as Citrix Solution Advisors, value-added distributors, or VADs, systems integrators, or SIs, independent software vendors, or ISVs, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs and Citrix Service Providers, or CSPs.
We are a Delaware corporation incorporated on April 17, 1989.

Executive Summary
Our solutions mobilize desktops, apps and data to help our customers drive value. We continue driving innovation in the datacenter with our solutions across both physical and software defined networking platforms while powering some of the world’s largest clouds and giving enterprises the capabilities to combine best-in-class application networking services on a single, consolidated footprint.
On January 31, 2017, we completed the spin-off of our GoTo Business (the “Spin-off”) and subsequent merger of that business with LogMeIn. In connection with the Spin-off, we distributed approximately 26.9 million shares of GetGo common stock to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 20, 2017. We delivered the shares of GetGo common stock to our transfer agent, who held such shares for the benefit of our stockholders. Immediately thereafter, Merger Sub was merged with and into GetGo, with GetGo continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of LogMeIn (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, each share of GetGo common stock was converted into the right to receive one share of LogMeIn common stock. As a result of these transactions, our stockholders received approximately 26.9 million shares of LogMeIn common stock in the aggregate, or 0.171844291 of a share of LogMeIn common stock for each share of Citrix common stock held of record by our stockholders as of the close of business on January 20, 2017. No fractional shares of LogMeIn were issued, and our stockholders instead received cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and related financial information reflect the GoTo Business operations, assets and liabilities, and cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
The distribution of the shares of GetGo common stock to our stockholders also resulted in an adjustment to the conversion rate for our 0.500% Convertible Notes due 2019 (the “Convertible Notes”) under the terms of the related indenture. As a result of this adjustment, the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes in effect as of the opening of business on February 1, 2017 was 13.9061 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes.
On July 7, 2017, our Board of Directors appointed David J. Henshall as President and Chief Executive Officer of Citrix, effective as of July 10, 2017. Mr. Henshall succeeded Kirill Tatarinov who stepped down from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer and director of Citrix on July 7, 2017. Mr. Henshall was also elected to our Board of Directors, effective as of July 10, 2017. In connection with Mr. Henshall’s appointment, Mark M. Coyle, Senior Vice President, Finance, was appointed interim Chief Financial Officer. Further, we recently announced the appointment of Andrew Del Matto as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, effective February 19, 2018. In July 2017, our Board also formed an Operations and Capital Committee that has worked with our management team and advises our Board of Directors on opportunities to drive margin expansion and return capital to stockholders.
On October 4, 2017, we announced a restructuring program to support our initiatives intended to accelerate our transformation to a cloud-based subscription business, increase strategic focus, and improve operational efficiency. The program includes, among other things, the elimination of full-time positions and facilities consolidation. We currently expect to record in the aggregate approximately $60.0 million to $100.0 million in pre-tax restructuring charges associated with this program. Included in these pre-tax charges are approximately $55.0 million to $70.0 million related to employee severance arrangements and approximately $5.0 million to $30.0 million related to the consolidation of leased facilities and other charges associated with the program.
On November 13, 2017, we announced that our Board approved an increase of an additional $1.7 billion to our existing share repurchase program. Additionally, on November 15, 2017, we issued $750.0 million of unsecured senior notes due

 31

December 1, 2027 (the "2027 Notes"). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $741.0 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repurchase $750.0 million of shares of our common stock through an ASR program.
On February 2, 2018, we entered into an ASR transaction with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“Dealer”) to pay an aggregate of $750.0 million in exchange for the delivery of approximately 6.5 million shares of our common stock based on current market prices. The purchase price per share under the ASR is subject to adjustment and is expected to equal the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the ASR, less a discount. The exact number of shares repurchased pursuant to the ASR will be determined based on such purchase price. The ASR transaction is expected to be completed by the end of April 2018. The ASR was entered into pursuant to our existing share repurchase program. After taking into account the additional $750.0 million shares repurchased pursuant to this ASR, we will have approximately $500.0 million of remaining share repurchase authorization available.
On February 6, 2018, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of Cedexis, Inc. (“Cedexis”) whose solution is a real-time data driven service for dynamically optimizing the flow of traffic across public clouds, data centers that provides a dynamic and reliable way to route and manage Internet performance for customers moving towards hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. The total preliminary cash consideration for this transaction was approximately $66.5 million, net of $6.2 million cash acquired.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we accelerated our innovation in the cloud, with the introduction of new services, features and capabilities in our cloud solution to build out a comprehensive secure digital workspace. We are seeing an increasing shift in the way customers are purchasing our solutions, evolving towards a more subscription-based business model. We expect our transition to a subscription-based business model to provide financial and operational benefits to Citrix, including by increasing customer life-time-value, expanding our customer use-cases and innovation opportunities, and extending the use of Citrix services to securely deliver a broader array of applications, including Web, SaaS apps and services.
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we continued to report our revenues in four groupings: (1) product and license; (2) license updates and maintenance; (3) professional services; and (4) software as a service. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we plan to adjust our groupings for reporting revenue to align with our subscription-based business model transition as follows: (1) product and license revenue from perpetual product offerings; (2) support and services revenue for perpetual product and license offerings; and (3) subscription revenue, which will include revenue from our ratable cloud services offerings and on-premise subscriptions as well as revenue from our CSP offerings.
 Summary of Results
For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, we delivered the following financial performance:

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• Product and license revenue decreased 2.9% to $857.3 million;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
• Software as a service revenue increased 30.5% to $175.8 million;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• License updates and maintenance revenue increased 4.6% to $1.7 billion;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
• Professional services revenue increased 0.4% to $131.7 million;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
• Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 0.8% to 84.4%;

- ------------------------------------------------------
• Operating income increased 1.9% to $571.0 million; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 95.3% to $0.14.

The decrease in our Product and licenses revenue was primarily driven by lower overall sales of our Networking products. Our Software as a service revenues increased due to increased sales of our Content Collaboration offerings and our Workspace Services offerings delivered via the cloud. The increase in License updates and maintenance revenue was primarily due to increased sales of software maintenance revenues across our Workspace Services and Networking products, partially offset by a decrease in our Subscription Advantage product, which has reached end of sale, and our technical support as customers continue to migrate to our new software maintenance solutions. Professional services revenue remained consistent when comparing 2017 to 2016. We currently expect total revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017. In addition, when comparing the 2018 fiscal year to the 2017 fiscal year, we currently expect total revenue to increase. Gross margin remained consistent when comparing 2017 to 2016. The increase in operating income when comparing 2017 to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in revenues. The decrease in diluted earnings per share when comparing 2017 to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in tax expense due to charges related to the estimated impact from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act”) that was signed on December 22, 2017.

2017 Business Combination
On January 3, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of Unidesk Corporation (“Unidesk” or the "2017 Business Combination"). We acquired Unidesk to enhance our application management and delivery offerings. The total cash consideration for this transaction was $60.4 million, net of $2.7 million of cash acquired. Transaction costs associated with the acquisition were not significant.
We have included the effect of the Unidesk acquisition in our results of operations prospectively from the date of acquisition.
2016 Business Combination
On September 7, 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of a privately-held company. The acquisition provides a software solution that cuts the cost of desktop and application virtualization and delivers workspace performance by accelerating desktop logon and application response times for any Microsoft Windows-based environment. The total cash consideration for this transaction was approximately $11.5 million, net of $0.8 million cash acquired. Transaction costs associated with the acquisition were not significant. The assets related to this acquisition primarily include $8.2 million of product technology identifiable intangible assets with a four year life and goodwill of $4.7 million.
2016 Asset Acquisition
On January 8, 2016, we acquired certain monitoring technology assets from a privately-held company for total cash consideration of $23.6 million. The acquisition provides a monitoring solution for Citrix's solutions as it relates to Microsoft Windows applications and desktop delivery. The identifiable intangible assets acquired related primarily to product technologies.
2016 Divestiture
On February 29, 2016, we sold our CloudPlatform and CloudPortal Business Manager solutions to Persistent Telecom Solutions, Inc. The agreement included contingent consideration in the form of an earnout provision based on revenue for a period of five years following the closing date. Any income associated with the contingent consideration will be recognized if the earnout provisions are met. No earnout provisions were met during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Therefore, no income was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience. Actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions. If actual results significantly differ from our estimates, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted.
We believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business, results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We have discussed the development, selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and our independent auditors, and our Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when it is earned and when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or the service has been provided and we have no remaining obligations; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. We define these four criteria as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists. Evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor, reseller or end user agreement. For SaaS, we generally require the customer or the reseller to electronically accept the terms of an online services agreement or execute a contract.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Delivery has occurred and we have no remaining obligations. We consider delivery of licenses under electronic licensing agreements to have occurred when the related products are shipped and the end-user has been electronically provided the software activation keys that allow the end-user to take immediate possession of the product. For hardware appliance sales, our standard delivery method is free-on-board shipping point. Consequently, we consider delivery of appliances to have occurred when the products are shipped pursuant to an agreement and purchase order. For SaaS, delivery occurs upon providing the users with their login id and password. For product training and consulting services, we fulfill our obligation when the services are performed. For license updates and maintenance, we assume that our obligation is satisfied ratably over the respective terms of the agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months. For SaaS, we assume that our obligation is satisfied ratably over the respective terms of the agreements, which are typically 12 months.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The fee is fixed or determinable. In the normal course of business, we do not provide customers with the right to a refund of any portion of their license fees or extended payment terms. The fees are considered fixed or determinable upon establishment of an arrangement that contains the final terms of the sale including description, quantity and price of each product or service purchased. For SaaS, the fee is considered fixed or determinable if it is not subject to refund or adjustment.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Collectability is probable. We assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer. Management’s judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection, which is generally based on an evaluation of customer specific information, historical experience and economic market conditions. If we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectability is not probable, revenue recognition is deferred until customer payment is received and the other parameters of revenue recognition described above have been achieved.

The majority of our product and license revenue consists of revenue from the sale of software solutions. Software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software and are subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance. In accordance with this guidance, we allocate revenue to license updates related to our software and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on VSOE of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria described above have been met. The balance of the revenues, net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered. If management cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on VSOE of fair value, revenue recognition is deferred until all elements are delivered, all services have been performed, or until fair value can be objectively determined. We also make certain judgments to record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume-based incentives, at the time sales are recorded.
For hardware appliance and software transactions, the arrangement consideration is allocated to stand-alone software deliverables as a group and the non-software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of using the selling price hierarchy in the revenue recognition guidance. The selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on its VSOE if available, third-party evidence, or TPE, if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition. VSOE of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific solutions and services. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating competitor solutions or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated customers. However, as our solutions contain a significant element of proprietary technology and our solutions offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of solutions with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products’ selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, we are not typically able to determine TPE. The estimate of selling price is established considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels and competitor pricing strategies.
For our non-software transactions, we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables. For our hardware appliances, we use ESP as our selling price. For our support and services, we generally use

 34

VSOE as our selling price. When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE for our support and services, we use ESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration.
Our Content Collaboration (formerly Data) solutions are considered hosted service arrangements per the authoritative guidance; accordingly, fees related to online service agreements are recognized ratably over the contract term. In addition, SaaS revenues may also include set-up fees, which are recognized ratably over the contract term or the expected customer life, whichever is longer. See Notes 2 and 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further information on our revenue recognition.

Valuation and Classification of Investments
The authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Our available-for-sale investments are measured to fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we hold investments that are accounted for based on the cost method. These investments are periodically reviewed for impairment and when indicators of impairment exist, are measured to fair value as appropriate on a non-recurring basis. In determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques. The authoritative guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
The authoritative guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: Level 1, observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, Level 2, inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly, and Level 3, unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires us to develop our own assumptions. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are based on market data obtained from independent sources, such as market quoted prices. When Level 1 observable inputs for our investments are not available to determine their fair value, we must then use other inputs which may include indicative pricing for securities from the same issuer with similar terms, yield curve information, benchmark data, prepayment speeds and credit quality or unobservable inputs that reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investments based on the best information available in the circumstances. When valuation techniques, other than those described as Level 1 are utilized, management must make estimations and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments. The degree to which management’s estimation and judgment is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing available for the investments, the availability of observable inputs, the frequency of trading in the investments and the investment’s complexity. If we make different judgments regarding unobservable inputs, we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments.
After we have determined the fair value of our investments, for those that are in an unrealized loss position, we must then determine if the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. We review our investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment and if different judgments are used the classification of the losses related to our investments could differ. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the carrying value of an available-for-sale investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than carrying value our intent to retain or sell the investment and whether it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may not be until maturity. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer, including industry and sector performance, rating agency actions and changes in credit default swap levels. For our cost method investments, our quarterly review of impairment indicators encompasses the analysis of specific criteria of the entity, such as cash position, financing needs, operational performance, management changes, competition and turnaround potential. If any of the above impairment indicators are present, we further evaluate whether an other-than-temporary impairment should be recorded. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. See Notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information on our investments.

Intangible Assets
We have product related technology assets and other intangible assets from acquisitions and other third party agreements. We allocate the purchase price of intangible assets acquired through third party agreements based on their estimated relative fair values. We allocate a portion of purchase price of acquired companies to the product related technology assets and other intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. We typically engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of product related technology assets and other intangible assets acquired. Such

 35

valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in determining the fair value and useful lives of the product related technology assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows. Critical estimates in valuing certain other intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer retention rates, customer lists, distribution agreements, patents, brand awareness and market position, as well as discount rates.
Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.
We monitor acquired intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis by reviewing for indicators of impairment. If an indicator exists we compare the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the intangible asset. The recoverability of the intangible assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize solutions utilizing the acquired technologies, retain existing customers and customer contracts, and maintain brand awareness. The estimated net realizable value of the acquired intangible assets is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such intangible assets. Our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our solutions, customer retention rates and ability to secure and maintain our market position. Actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts. If these solutions are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors, and there is no alternative future use for the technology; or if we fail to retain acquired customers or successfully market acquired brands, we could determine that some or all of the remaining $142.0 million carrying value of our acquired intangible assets is impaired. In the event of impairment, we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Goodwill
The excess of the fair value of purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities from our acquisitions is recorded as goodwill. At December 31, 2017, we had $1.61 billion in goodwill related to our acquisitions. Our revenues are derived from sales of our Workspace Services solutions, Networking products, and related license updates and maintenance, and our Content Collaboration offerings. As part of our continued transformation, effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized a part of our business by creating a new Content Collaboration product grouping. In connection with this change, we performed an assessment of our goodwill reporting units and determined that the reorganization resulted in the identification of two goodwill reporting units (excluding the GoTo Business). Additionally, on January 31, 2017, we completed the Spin-off of the GoTo Business and $380.9 million of the goodwill attributable to the GoTo Business as of December 31, 2016 was distributed to GetGo. As a result of the Spin-off, we performed an assessment of the two remaining goodwill reporting units and determined that they remain unchanged. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for additional information regarding our reportable segment.
We account for goodwill in accordance with FASB’s authoritative guidance, which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test. We complete our goodwill and certain intangible assets impairment tests on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill and certain intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing for goodwill and certain intangible assets is necessary, and we refer to this assessment as the Qualitative Screen. In performing the Qualitative Screen, we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to the following: the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business, industry and market trends, and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate. If after performing the Qualitative Screen impairment indicators are present, we would perform a quantitative impairment test to estimate the fair value of goodwill and certain intangible assets. In doing so, we would estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the goodwill and certain intangible assets carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations. As a result of the Qualitative Screen, no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary. There was no impairment of goodwill as a result of the annual impairment tests completed during the

 36

fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016.

Income Taxes
We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2017, we had $152.3 million in net deferred tax assets. The authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. At December 31, 2017, we determined that a $76.8 million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits was necessary. If the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future, we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes.
In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain, thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments. Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings. Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
The 2017 Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, in part but not limited to, reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The SEC staff acknowledged the challenges companies face incorporating the effects of tax reform by their financial reporting deadlines. In response, on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. As of December 31, 2017, we recorded a provisional income tax charge of $64.8 million for the re-measurement of our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities because of the federal corporate maximum tax rate reduction. We also recorded a provisional income tax charge of $364.6 million for the transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income. The provisional amounts recorded are based on our current interpretation and understanding of the 2017 Tax Act, are judgmental and may change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance. We will continue to gather and evaluate the income tax impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Changes to these provisional amounts or any of our other estimates regarding taxes could result in material charges or credits in future reporting periods.

Convertible Senior Notes
In April 2014, we completed a private placement of our Convertible Notes due 2019 with a net share settlement feature, meaning that upon conversion, the principal amount will be settled in cash and the remaining amount, if any, will be settled in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. In accordance with accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets on conversion, we first determine the carrying amount of the liability component by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component. Then we determine the carrying amount of the equity component represented by the embedded conversion option by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial proceeds ascribed to the convertible debt instrument as a whole. Debt discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.
As a result of the structure of the RMT transaction with LogMeIn and the notification on October 10, 2016 to noteholders in accordance with the Indenture, the Convertible Notes became convertible until the earlier of (1) the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the ex-dividend date for the distribution of the outstanding shares of GetGo common stock to the Company’s stockholders by way of a pro rata dividend, and (2) the Company’s announcement that such distribution will not take place, even though the Convertible Notes were not otherwise convertible at December 31, 2016. The $1.44 billion Convertible Notes became convertible with the notice to noteholders. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2016, the carrying amount of the Convertible Notes of $1.3 billion was reclassified from Other liabilities to Current liabilities and the difference between the face value and carrying value of $79.5 million was reclassified from stockholders’ equity to temporary equity in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The conversion period terminated as of the close of business on January 31, 2017 in connection with the Spin-off. As a result, the Convertible Notes were reclassified to Other liabilities from Current liabilities, and the amount previously recorded as Temporary equity was reclassified to Stockholders' equity.

Revenues
Net revenues include Product and licenses, License updates and maintenance, Professional services and SaaS revenues. Product and licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of the following major solutions:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Workspace Services is primarily comprised of our Application Virtualization solutions which include XenDesktop and XenApp, our Enterprise Mobility Management solutions which include XenMobile solutions and Citrix Workspace; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------
• Networking primarily includes NetScaler ADC and NetScaler SD-WAN.

We offer incentive programs to our VADs and VARs to stimulate demand for our solutions. Product and license revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our VADs and VARs. In addition, our CSP program provides subscription-based services in which the CSP partners host software services to their end users. The fees from the CSP program are recognized based on usage and as the CSP services are provided to their end users.

 39

License updates and maintenance consists of maintenance and support fees related to the following offerings:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Customer Success Services, which gives customers a choice of tiered support offerings that combine the elements of product version upgrades, guidance, enablement, support and proactive monitoring to help our customers and our partners fully realize their business goals. Fees associated with this offering are recognized ratably over the term of the contract;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maintenance for our Networking products, which include technical support and hardware and software maintenance, are recognized ratably over the contract term; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Subscription Advantage program which has been retired and reached end of sale and end of renewal for existing customers. Fees associated with these offerings are being recognized ratably over the remaining term of existing contracts, which was typically 12 to 24 months.

Professional services revenues are comprised of:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fees from consulting services related to the implementation of our solutions, which are recognized as the services are provided; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fees from product training and certification, which are recognized as the services are provided.

Our SaaS revenues, which are recognized ratably over the contractual term, primarily consist of fees related to our Content Collaboration offerings, primarily ShareFile, as well as fees related to our Workspace Services and Networking offerings and products delivered via the cloud.

Product and licenses

Product and licenses revenue decreased during 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily due to lower sales of our Networking products of $25.9 million. Product and licenses revenue increased during 2016 when compared to 2015 due to higher overall sales of our Workspace Services solutions of $8.3 million and Networking products of $7.1 million. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of our non-core products of $8.0 million as a result of our product portfolio rationalization. We currently expect Product and licenses revenue to decrease when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017 due to the continued transition to a subscription-based business model as we are offering our customers the option to purchase our solutions as a subscription, whereby a fee is paid for the right to use our software and receive support for a specified period.

Software as a Service
Software as a service revenue increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to increased sales of our Content Collaboration offerings of $24.4 million and our Workspace Services offerings delivered via the cloud of $15.7 million. Software as a service revenue increased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased sales of our Content Collaboration offerings. We currently expect our Software as a Service revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017 as customers continue to shift to our cloud-based solutions.

License updates and maintenance
In October 2016, we announced the launch of Customer Success Services, which replaced Software Maintenance and provides a higher standard of service that empowers customer success whether in the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment through additional services providing expert guidance, proactive monitoring and enablement. In connection with this launch, beginning in 2017, our customers began migrating from the Subscription Advantage and Software Maintenance programs to this new offering.

 40

License updates and maintenance revenue increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in software maintenance revenues of $343.6 million, primarily driven by increased sales of maintenance revenues across our Workspace Services solutions, partially offset by a decrease in our Subscription Advantage product of $259.9 million and our technical support of $30.9 million. License updates and maintenance revenue increased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in hardware and software maintenance revenues of $291.2 million, primarily driven by increased sales of maintenance revenues across our Workspace Services and Networking products, partially offset by decreases in our Subscription Advantage product of $180.4 million and our technical and premier support of $44.6 million. These results are due to our new Customer Success Services offering discussed above. We currently expect that License updates and maintenance revenue will increase when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017 due to our new Customer Success Services offerings.

Professional services
Professional services revenue remained consistent when comparing 2017 to 2016. The increase in Professional services revenue when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily due to increased implementation services and product training and certification related to our Workspace Services solutions. We currently expect Professional services revenue to remain consistent when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017.

Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenues are primarily comprised of License updates and maintenance revenue from maintenance fees, which include software and hardware maintenance, our Subscription Advantage program and technical support. Deferred revenues also include SaaS revenue from our Content Collaboration and cloud-based subscription offerings and Professional services revenue primarily related to our consulting contracts.
Deferred revenues increased approximately $179.9 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in sales of our software maintenance offerings of $439.7 million and SaaS of $44.1 million, partially offset by a net decrease in sales of our Subscription Advantage product of $323.6 million. We currently expect deferred revenue to increase in 2018.
While it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders, we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped. Although the amount of such product license orders may vary, the amount, if any, of such product license orders at the end of a particular period has not been material to total revenue at the end of any reporting period. We do not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is a reliable indicator of future performance.
Deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of income as the revenue recognition criteria are met. Unbilled revenue primarily represents future billings under our subscription agreements that have not been invoiced and, accordingly, are not recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenue within our financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, we had unbilled revenue of $78.1 million. Deferred revenue and unbilled revenue are influenced by several factors, including new business seasonality within the year, the specific timing, size and duration of customer subscription agreements, varying billing cycles of subscription agreements, and invoice timing. Fluctuations in unbilled revenue may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.

International Revenues
International revenues (sales outside the United States) accounted for approximately 46.3% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, 46.3% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 48.7% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015. The change in our international revenues as a percentage of our net revenues for the periods presented is not significant. For detailed information on international revenues, please refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to 2016 2016 Compared to 2015
 2017 2016 2015
 (In thousands)
Cost of product and license revenues $ 123,356 $ 121,391 $ 118,265 $ 1,965 $ 3,126
Cost of services and maintenance revenues 250,602 228,080 228,503 22,522 (423 )
Amortization of product related intangible assets 50,183 54,290 71,001 (4,107 ) (16,711 )
Impairment of product related intangible assets 15,505 1,128 56,271 14,377 (55,143 )
Total cost of net revenues $ 439,646 $ 404,889 $ 474,040 $ 34,757 $ (69,151 )

Cost of product and license revenues consists primarily of hardware, shipping expense, royalties, product media and duplication, manuals and packaging materials. Cost of services and maintenance revenues consists primarily of compensation and other personnel-related costs of providing technical support, consulting, cloud capacity costs, as well as the costs related to providing our SaaS offerings. Also included in Cost of net revenues is amortization of product related intangible assets.
Cost of product and license revenues increased during 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily due to royalties from our Workspace Services solutions. Cost of product and license revenues increased during 2016 when compared to 2015 primarily due to higher sales of our Networking products, some of which contain hardware components that have a higher cost than our software solutions. We currently expect cost of product and license revenues will decrease when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017, consistent with the expected decrease in revenues as noted above.
Cost of services and maintenance revenues increased during 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in sales of our software maintenance of $12.8 million from our new Customer Success Services offering, an increase in sales of our Workspace Services offerings delivered via the cloud of $5.1 million, and an increase in sales of our Content Collaboration offerings of $2.8 million. Cost of services and maintenance revenues decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in implementation services and product training and certification costs of $20.1 million related to our Workspace Services solutions, partially offset by an increase in costs due to higher sales of our Content Collaboration offerings of $17.8 million and support and maintenance costs related to our Workspace Services and Networking products of $1.9 million. We currently expect cost of services and maintenance revenues will increase when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017 consistent with the increase in SaaS revenue and License updates and maintenance revenues as discussed above.
Amortization of product related intangible assets decreased during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to lower amortization of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. Amortization of product related intangible assets decreased during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to lower amortization of certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized as a result of impairments during 2015.
Impairment of product related intangible assets increased during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the impairments of certain acquired intangible assets in 2017. Impairment of product related intangible assets decreased during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the impairments of certain acquired intangible assets in 2015.
Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 84.4% for 2017, 85.2% for 2016 and 82.1% for 2015. Gross margin remained consistent when comparing 2017 to 2016. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue when comparing 2016 to 2015 was primarily due to 2015 including the impairment of certain product related intangible assets.

Operating Expenses
Foreign Currency Impact on Operating Expenses
The functional currency for all of our wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. A substantial majority of our overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the impact on our operating results, we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks up to 12 months in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses. When the dollar is weak, the resulting increase to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the gain in our hedging contracts. When the dollar is strong, the resulting decrease to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the loss in our hedging contracts. There is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the timeframe for which we hedge our risk.

cloud capacity costs directly related to our research and development activities. We expensed substantially all development costs included in the research and development of our solutions.
Research and development expenses increased during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $8.7 million, an increase in compensation and other employee-related costs of $8.6 million, and an increase in cloud capacity costs of $7.1 million. The increase in compensation and other employee-related costs was primarily related to a net increase in headcount prior to the restructuring program announced in October 2017 intended to accelerate the transformation to a cloud-based subscription business, increase strategic focus, and improve operational efficiency. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in facility and equipment costs of $3.7 million.
Research and development expenses decreased during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in compensation and employee-related costs mostly related to a net decrease in headcount resulting from restructuring activities
initiated in 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred costs of $8.1 million related to operational initiatives designed to improve our infrastructure scalability and cost saving efficiencies. The charges primarily related to employee severance. Activities related to this program were substantially completed as of the fourth quarter of 2017.

 44

During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred costs of $1.9 million, $44.5 million and $29.4 million primarily related to our announced plan in November 2015 to simplify our enterprise go-to-market motion and roles while improving coverage, reflect changes in our product focus, and balance resources with demand across our marketing, general and administration areas.

When comparing 2017 and 2016, the increase is primarily due to the issuance of our 2027 Notes in 2017. When comparing 2016 to 2015, the increase in interest expense was not significant. For more information regarding our debt, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Other income (expense), net $ 3,150 $ (4,131 ) $ (5,730 ) $ 7,281 $ 1,599

Other income (expense), net is primarily comprised of remeasurement of foreign currency transaction gains (losses), realized losses related to changes in the fair value of our investments that have a decline in fair value considered other-than-temporary and recognized gains (losses) related to our investments, which was not material for all periods presented.
The change in Other income (expense), net when comparing 2017 to 2016 is primarily driven by an increase in net gains on remeasurement and settlements of foreign currency transactions.

 45

The change in Other income (expense), net when comparing 2016 to 2015 is primarily driven by a decrease in losses on the remeasurement and settlements of foreign currency transactions of $5.5 million, decrease in impairment charges of $2.2 million recognized on cost method investments and an increase in gains recognized on available for sale investments of $1.4 million. These changes are partially offset by a decrease in gains recognized on cost method investments of $7.0 million.

Income Taxes
We are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements. We maintain certain strategic management and operational activities in overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are generally lower than in the United States.
On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act”) into law effective January 1, 2018. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, in part but not limited to: reducing the U.S. corporate maximum tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, modifying executive compensation deduction limitations, and repealing the deduction for domestic production activities. Under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, the Company must recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period in which the new legislation is enacted.
Our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to lower tax rates on earnings generated by our foreign operations that are taxed primarily in Switzerland. From time to time, there may be other items that impact the tax rate, such as the items specific to the current period discussed above.
The SEC staff acknowledged the challenges companies face incorporating the effects of tax reform by their financial reporting deadlines. In response, on December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act. As of December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional income tax charge of $64.8 million for the re-measurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities because of the federal corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%. The Company recorded a provisional income tax charge of $364.6 million for the transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income. The Company also accounted for the modified executive compensation deduction limitations pursuant to the 2017 Tax Act as of December 31, 2017.
The provisional amounts recorded are based on the Company’s current interpretation and understanding of the 2017 Tax Act and may change as the Company receives additional clarification and implementation guidance. The Company will continue to gather and evaluate the income tax impact of the 2017 Tax Act. Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company will complete the accounting for the tax effects of all of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act within the required measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date.
Our effective tax rate was approximately 96.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate when comparing the year ended December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to accounting for the estimated tax impact of the 2017 Tax Act and the separation of the GoTo Business.
As of December 31, 2017, our net unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately $77.8 million as compared to $69.8 million as of December 31, 2016. All amounts included in this balance affect the annual effective tax rate. As of the year ended December 31, 2017, we accrued $2.7 million for the payment of interest on uncertain tax positions.
We and one or more of our subsidiaries are subject to federal income taxes in the United States, as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently not subject to a U.S. federal income tax examination. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S., federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2014.
In the ordinary course of global business, there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain; thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. We provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability. We adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments. Changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings. Due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate, it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future, which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
As of December 31, 2017, we had $152.3 million in net deferred tax assets. The authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not

 46

that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments, as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2017, we determined that a $76.8 million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits was necessary. If the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future, we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes.
We currently expect our effective tax rate to decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to capturing the provisional impact of the 2017 Tax Act and the separation of the GoTo Business executed in and unique to 2017.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
During 2017, we generated continuing operating cash flows of $964.3 million. These operating cash flows related primarily to net income from continuing operations of $22.0 million, adjusted for, among other things, non-cash charges, depreciation and amortization expenses of $170.0 million, stock-based compensation expense of $165.1 million, deferred income tax expense of $94.2 million, and amortization of debt discount and transaction costs of $38.3 million. Also contributing to these cash inflows was a change in operating assets and liabilities of $470.5 million, net of effects of acquisitions. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of changes in net income taxes of $318.8 million due to tax reform, and changes in deferred revenue of $174.4 million. Our continuing operations investing activities used $60.0 million of cash consisting primarily of cash paid for net purchases of investments of $86.4 million, cash paid for the purchase of property and equipment of $80.9 million, cash paid for acquisitions of $60.4 million, and cash paid for licensing agreements and technology of $7.4 million. Our continuing operations financing activities used cash of $694.4 million, primarily due to stock repurchases of $1.17 billion, amounts paid for, but not settled under our accelerated stock repurchase program of $150.0 million, cash paid for tax withholding on vested stock awards of $80.0 million, and the transfer of cash to the GoTo Business resulting from the separation of $28.5 million. This financing cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds from the 2027 Notes of $741.0 million, net of issuance costs.
During 2016, we generated continuing operating cash flows of $947.2 million. These operating cash flows related primarily to income from continuing operations of $469.9 million, adjusted for, among other things, non-cash charges, depreciation, and amortization expenses of $178.4 million and stock-based compensation expense of $152.7 million. Also contributing to these cash inflows was a change in operating assets and liabilities of $132.9 million, net of effects of acquisitions. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of changes in deferred revenue of $142.4 million, and changes in income taxes, net of $42.4 million mostly due to an increase in income taxes payable. These inflows are partially offset by an outflow in accounts receivable of $61.7 million driven by an increase in the receivable balance due to higher bookings. Our continuing operations investing activities used $434.7 million of cash consisting primarily of cash paid for net purchases of investments of $311.6 million, cash paid for the purchase of property and equipment of $85.0 million, cash paid for licensing agreements and technology of $25.9 million, and cash paid for acquisitions of $13.2 million. Our continuing operations financing activities used cash of $38.0 million primarily due to cash paid for tax withholding on vested stock awards of $66.6 million and stock repurchases of $28.7 million. This financing cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock-based compensation plans of $41.2 million and excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation $16.0 million.
Senior Notes
On November 15, 2017, we issued $750.0 million of the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.500% per annum. Interest on the 2027 Notes is due semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2018. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $741.0 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Net proceeds from this offering were used to repurchase shares of our common stock through an ASR transaction which we entered into with the ASR Counterparty on November 13, 2017. The 2027 Notes will mature on December 1, 2027, unless redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to such date. We may redeem the 2027 Notes at our option at any time in whole or from time to time in part prior to September 1, 2027 at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed and (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments under such 2027 Notes, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. Among other terms, under certain circumstances, holders of the 2027 Notes may require us to repurchase their 2027 Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control prior to maturity for cash at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for additional details on the 2027 Notes.

Credit Facility
On January 7, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other lenders party thereto from time to time collectively, the Lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility for a term of five years, of which we have drawn and repaid $165.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $250.0 million credit line remains available for borrowing. We may elect to increase the revolving credit facility by up to $250.0 million if existing or new lenders provide additional revolving commitments in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) a customary London interbank offered rate formula or (b) a customary base rate formula, plus the applicable margin with respect thereto, in each case as set forth in the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 3.5:1.0 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0:1.0. The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, with corresponding grace periods in certain circumstances, including, without limitation, payment defaults, cross-defaults, the occurrence of a change of control and bankruptcy-related defaults. The Lenders are entitled to accelerate repayment of the loans under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of any of the events of default. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our ability to grant liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, change our business and incur subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of this size and type. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for additional details on our Credit Agreement.
Convertible Senior Notes
In April 2014, we completed a private placement of $1.44 billion principal amount of 0.500% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019, or the Convertible Notes. The net proceeds from this offering were approximately $1.42 billion (including the proceeds from the Over-Allotment Option), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the offering expenses payable by us. We used approximately $82.6 million of the net proceeds to pay the cost of certain bond hedges entered into in connection with the offering (after such cost was partially offset by the proceeds to us from certain warrant transactions). See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for additional details on the Convertible Notes and the related bond hedges and warrant transactions.
We used the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering and a portion of our existing cash and investments to purchase an aggregate of approximately $1.5 billion of our common stock under our share repurchase program. We used approximately $101.0 million to purchase shares of our common stock from certain purchasers of the Convertible Notes in privately negotiated transactions concurrently with the closing of the offering, and the remaining $1.4 billion to purchase additional shares of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase transaction in 2014, which we entered into with Citibank, N.A., or Citibank, on April 25, 2014, and which is discussed in further detail in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.
The conversion period for the Convertible Notes that commenced on October 10, 2016 in connection with the structure of the RMT transaction with LogMeIn, terminated as of the close of business on January 31, 2017. As a result, the Convertible Notes were reclassified to Other liabilities from Current liabilities and the amount previously recorded as Temporary equity was reclassified to permanent equity as of January 31, 2017. The Distribution also resulted in an adjustment to the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes under the terms of the related indenture. As a result of this adjustment, the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes in effect as of the opening of business on February 1, 2017 was 13.9061 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which corresponds to a conversion price of approximately $71.91 per share of common stock. Corresponding adjustments were made to the conversion rates for the Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions as of the opening of business on February 1, 2017.
Historically, significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations. We currently expect this trend to continue throughout 2017. We believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. We continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives. We could from time to time continue to seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions, potential redemption of our Convertible Notes and for general corporate purposes.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments

-------------------------------------- -------------- --------- --------------------- - --------- - -------

 2017 2016
 (In thousands)
Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 2,731,974 $ 2,543,160 $ 188,814

The increase in cash, cash equivalents and investments at December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016, is primarily due to cash provided by our operating activities of $964.3 million, proceeds from our 2027 Notes, net of issuance costs of $741.0 million, partially offset by cash paid for stock repurchases of $1.17 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $80.9 million, cash paid for tax withholding on vested stock awards of $80.0 million, cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $60.4 million, transfer of $28.5 million in cash during the first quarter of 2017 to the GoTo Business resulting from the separation, and cash paid for licensing agreements and technology of $7.4 million. As of December 31, 2017, $2.13 billion of the $2.73 billion of cash, cash equivalents and investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries can be repatriated without incurring any additional U.S. federal tax. Upon repatriation of these funds, we could be subject to foreign and U.S. State income taxes. The amount of taxes due is dependent on the amount and manner of the repatriation, as well as the locations from which the funds are repatriated and received. We generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade, highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs. Our short-term and long-term investments primarily consist of interest-bearing securities.
Accounts Receivable, Net

------------------------------- -------------- ------- --------------------- ------ - ------- --- - ------

 December 31, 2017 Compared to 2016
 2017 2016
 (In thousands)
Accounts receivable $ 717,180 $ 687,089 $ 30,091

Allowance for doubtful accounts (3,420 ) (3,889 ) 469
Accounts receivable, net $ 712,535 $ 681,206 $ 31,329

The increase in accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 was primarily due to higher sales during the year ended December 31, 2017. The activity in our allowance for returns was comprised primarily of $5.7 million in credits issued for returns recorded during 2017, partially offset by $4.9 million of provisions for returns recorded during 2017. The activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts was comprised primarily of $4.4 million of uncollectible accounts written off, net of recoveries, partially offset by $3.9 million in provisions for doubtful accounts.
From time to time, we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers, which are comprised of large business enterprises, governments and small and medium-sized businesses. If the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates, our operating results could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2017, one distributor, the Arrow Group, accounted for 14% of gross accounts receivable. At December 31, 2016, two distributors, the Arrow Group and Ingram Micro, accounted for 14% and 10% of gross accounts receivable, respectively. For more information regarding significant customers see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Stock Repurchase Program
Our Board of Directors authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of $8.5 billion, of which $500.0 million was approved in January 2017 and an additional $1.7 billion was approved in November 2017. We may use the approved dollar authority to repurchase stock at any time until the approved amounts are exhausted. The objective of our stock repurchase program is to improve stockholders’ returns. At December 31, 2017, approximately $1.43 billion was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program. All shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. A portion of the funds used to repurchase stock over the course of the program was provided by net proceeds from the 2027 Notes and Convertible Notes offerings, as well as proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit.
We are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or in privately negotiated transactions.

 49

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we expended approximately $575.0 million on open market purchases under the stock repurchase program, repurchasing 7,384,368 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $77.86.
In addition to the repurchases described above, we used the net proceeds from our 2027 Notes offering and existing cash and investments to repurchase an aggregate of approximately $750.0 million of our common stock as authorized under our stock repurchase program. We paid $750.0 million to the ASR Counterparty under the ASR Agreement and received approximately 7.1 million shares of our common stock from the ASR Counterparty, which represents 80 percent of the shares pursuant to the ASR agreement. The total number of shares of common stock that we will repurchase under the ASR Agreement will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount. At settlement, the ASR Counterparty may be required to deliver additional shares of our common stock to us or, under certain circumstances, we may be required to deliver shares of our common stock or make a cash payment to the ASR Counterparty. Final settlement of the ASR agreement was completed in January 2018 and we received delivery of an additional 1,371,495 shares of our common stock. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for detailed information on our 2027 Notes offering and the transactions related thereto.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we expended approximately $28.7 million on open market purchases, repurchasing 426,300 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $67.30.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, we expended approximately $755.7 million on open market purchases, repurchasing 10,716,850 shares of outstanding common stock at an average price of $70.52.
Shares for Tax Withholding
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we withheld 974,501 shares, 830,155 shares and 679,694 shares, respectively, from equity awards that vested. Amounts withheld to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations that arose on the vesting of equity awards was $80.0 million for 2017, $66.6 million for 2016 and $46.3 million for 2015. These shares are reflected as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) Purchase obligations represent non-cancelable commitments to purchase inventory ordered before year-end 2018 of approximately $6.3 million and a contingent obligation to purchase inventory of approximately $19.4 million.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellations without payment provisions exist and excludes $77.8 million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions recorded in accordance with authoritative guidance, because we could not make reasonably reliable estimates of the period or amount of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further information.

As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, we recorded a provisional income tax charge of $364.6 million for the transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, which is payable up to eight years. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for further information.
As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any individually material capital lease obligations or other material long-term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any special purpose entities or off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

NOTE 12. Related Parties and Affiliates Conrail Through a limited liability company, CSX and Norfolk Southern Corporation ("NS") jointly own Conrail. CSX has a 42% economic interest and 50% voting interest in the jointly-owned entity, and NS has the remainder of the economic and voting interests. Pursuant to the Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture Topic in the ASC, CSX applies the equity method of accounting to its investment in Conrail. Conrail owns rail infrastructure and operates for the joint benefit of CSX and NS. This is known as the shared asset area. Conrail charges fees for right-of-way usage, equipment rentals and transportation, switching and terminal service charges in the shared asset area. These expenses are included in materials, supplies and other on the consolidated income statements.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...
