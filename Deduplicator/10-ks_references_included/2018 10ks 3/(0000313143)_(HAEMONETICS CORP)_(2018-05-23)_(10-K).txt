ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Business
Haemonetics is a global healthcare company dedicated to providing a suite of innovative hematology products and solutions to customers to help improve patient care and reduce the cost of healthcare. Our technology addresses important medical markets including commercial plasma collection, hospital-based diagnostics, blood and blood component collection and devices and software products. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” mean Haemonetics.
Blood is essential to a modern healthcare system. Blood and its components (plasma, platelets and red cells) have many vital and frequently life-saving clinical applications. Plasma is used for patients with major blood loss and is manufactured into biopharmaceuticals to treat a variety of illnesses, including immune diseases and coagulation disorders. Red cells treat trauma patients or patients undergoing surgery with high blood loss, such as open heart surgery or organ transplant. Platelets have many uses in patient care, including supporting cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
Recent Developments
Share Repurchase Program
On February 6, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $260 million of our outstanding common stock through March 30, 2019. Subsequent to announcing the share repurchase program, in February 2018, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR”) with Citibank N.A. (“Citibank”) to repurchase approximately $100.0 million of the Company’s common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR, in February 2018, the Company paid Citibank $100.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock based on a closing market price of $68.87, which represented, based on the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 8, 2018, approximately 80% of the notional amount of the ASR. On May 7, 2018, the ASR with Citibank was completed. Pursuant to the ASR settlement terms, Citibank delivered to us approximately 0.2 million additional shares of our common stock on May 9, 2018. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR was approximately 1.4 million at an average price per share of $73.36.

As of May 23, 2018, the total remaining authorization for repurchases of the Company’s common stock under our share repurchase program was $160 million.
Income Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") was enacted in the United States. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of March 31, 2018, we have not yet completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act. However, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and one-time transition tax. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense amount of $2.0 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Refer to Note 5, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
In addition to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and the one-time transition tax, which we have accounted for with provisional estimates as of March 31, 2018, we will also continue to analyze and monitor the other impacts of the Act that become effective for the Company in fiscal 2019 including the provisions related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income, Foreign Derived Intangible Income, Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, as well as other provisions that would limit the deductibility of future expenses.
NexSys PCSTM
In July 2017, we received FDA 510(k) clearance for our NexSys PCSTM plasmapheresis system (formerly referred to as PCS 300). In March 2018, we received FDA clearance for the enhancement of our NexSys PCS embedded software that activates YESTM technology, a yield-enhancing solution. We also received CE mark clearance of the NexSys PCS device in the European Union and Australia, subject to additional local requirements, during fiscal 2018. We have begun limited production of the devices.
Our planned roll out of this new platform includes the placement of a significant number of new devices. These placements will require meaningful capital expenditures and new customer contracts that reflect pricing and volumes appropriate to these investments. As of March 31, 2018, approximately 21,000 of our Haemonetics owned PCS2 devices are placed with customers.

Long-Term Supply Agreement
As part of our acquisition of the whole blood business from Pall Corporation (“Pall”) in fiscal 2012, Pall agreed to manufacture and install in one of our facilities a filter media manufacturing line (the “HDC line”) for which we agreed to pay Pall approximately $15.0 million (plus pre-approved overages). Pall also agreed to supply media to us for use in leukoreduction filters until such time as we accepted the HDC line.
On May 21, 2018, we entered into a long-term supply agreement with Pall under which Pall will continue to supply media to us for use in leukoreduction filters. As a condition of the supply agreement, we agreed to accept the HDC line from Pall and will make a final payment of $9.0 million to Pall for the HDC line during May 2018.
As a result of the decision to continue to source media for our leukoreduction filters from Pall rather than producing them internally, we do not expect to utilize the HDC line for future production and expect that the asset’s future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying value of $12.5 million. Accordingly, during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we recorded $21.5 million of total charges associated with this transaction, consisting of a $12.5 million impairment charge for the HDC line and a $9.0 million charge for the final payment to Pall.
Divestiture
On April 27, 2017, we sold our SEBRA® line of benchtop and hand sealers to Machine Solutions Inc. because it was no longer aligned with our long-term strategic objectives. In connection with this transaction, we received net proceeds of $9.0 million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $8.0 million. The proceeds received were subject to a post-closing adjustment based on final asset values as determined during the 90 day transition period. During fiscal 2018, the 90 day transition period ended and there were no post-close adjustments necessary.
The SEBRA portfolio included a suite of products that primarily include radio frequency sealers that are used to seal tubing as part of the collection of whole blood and blood components, particularly plasma. The SEBRA product line generated approximately $6.5 million of revenue in our Plasma business unit in fiscal 2017.
Restructuring Initiative
On November 1, 2017, we launched the Complexity Reduction Initiative (the "2018 Program"), a company-wide restructuring program designed to improve operational performance and reduce cost, freeing up resources to invest in accelerated growth. This program includes a reduction of headcount and operating costs that will enable a more streamlined organizational structure. We expect to incur aggregate charges between $50 million and $60 million associated with these actions, of which we expect $35 million to $40 million will consist of severance and other employee costs and the remainder will consist of other exit costs, primarily related to third party services. These charges, substantially all of which will result in cash outlays, will be incurred as the specific actions required to execute on these initiatives are identified and approved and are expected to continue through fiscal 2020. We expect savings from this program of approximately $80 million on an annualized basis once the program is completed. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we incurred $36.6 million of restructuring and turnaround costs under this program.
Product Recall
In June 2016, we issued a voluntary recall of certain whole blood collection kits sold to our Blood Center customers in the U.S. The recall resulted from some collection sets' filters failing to adequately remove leukocytes from collected blood. As a result of the recall, our Blood Center customers may have conducted tests to confirm that the collected blood was adequately leukoreduced, sold the collected blood labeled as non-leukoreduced at a lower price or discarded the collected blood. During fiscal 2018, we entered into a settlement agreement with a group of customers responsible for substantially all of the total outstanding claims against us. As of March 31, 2018, we had recorded a cumulative total of $7.2 million of net charges associated with this recall, which consisted of $3.7 million of charges associated with customer returns and inventory reserves and $8.5 million of other customer claims, partially offset by $5.0 million of insurance proceeds. Substantially all of these claims have been paid as of March 31, 2018.
Market Trends
Plasma Market
There are two key aspects to the market for our plasma products - the growth in demand for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals and the limited number of significant biopharmaceutical companies in this market.
Changes in demand for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals, particularly immunoglobulin, are the key driver of plasma collection volumes in the biopharmaceutical market. Various factors related to the supply of plasma and the production of plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals also affect collection volume, including the following:

27

Table of Contents

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Biopharmaceutical companies are seeking more yield from the collected plasma to meet growing demand for biopharmaceuticals without requiring an equivalent increase in plasma supply.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Newly approved indications for, and the growing understanding and thus diagnosis of auto-immune diseases treated with plasma-derived therapies increase the demand for plasma, as do longer lifespans and a growing aging patient population.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Geographical expansion of biopharmaceuticals also increases demand for plasma.

Demand for our plasma products in fiscal 2018 continued to grow in North America as collection volumes benefited from an expanding end user market for plasma-derived biopharmaceuticals with U.S. produced plasma meeting an increasing percentage of plasma volume demand worldwide. As a result, our Plasma business’ revenues are primarily from the U.S.
Despite the overall growth in the market, the number of biopharmaceutical companies that collect and fractionate the majority of source plasma is low and industry consolidation is ongoing. Significant barriers to entry exist for new entrants due to high capital outlay requirements for fractionation, long regulatory pathways to the licensing of fractionation facilities and FDA approval of biopharmaceuticals. With these factors, we do not expect meaningful new entries or diversification. As a result, there are relatively few customers for our Plasma products, especially in the U.S. where 80% of source plasma is collected and only a few customers provide the majority of our U.S. revenue.
Blood Center Market
In the Blood Center market, we sell automated blood component and manual whole blood collection systems, as well as software solutions that include blood drive planning, donor recruitment and retention, blood collection, component manufacturing and distribution. While we sell products around the world, a significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of customers due to relatively limited number of blood collectors.
Within the Blood Center market, we have seen three trends that have negatively impacted our growth of the overall marketplace despite the overall increase in aging populations. Overall we continue to expect a decline in this business in the low to mid single-digits.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Declining transfusion rates in mature markets due to the development of more minimally invasive procedures with lower associated blood loss, as well as better blood management.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Competition in multi-unit collection technology for automated blood component collection systems has intensified and has negatively impact our sales in markets where these collections are prevalent.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▪ Industry consolidation through group purchasing organizations has intensified pricing competition particularly in the manual whole blood collection systems, as well as impacting our software business where switching large customers to new or emerging technology platforms has a relatively high cost.

Hospital Market
Hemostasis Management
Hemostasis Management Market - The use of routine coagulation testing is well established throughout the world in various medical procedures, including cardiovascular surgery, organ transplantation, trauma, post-partum hemorrhage and percutaneous coronary intervention. While standard tests like prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and platelet count have limited ability to reveal a patient’s risk for bleeding, they do not provide information on the patient’s risk for thrombosis. In addition, these routine tests do not provide specific data about clot quality or stability. As a result of these limitations, clinicians are increasingly utilizing advanced hemostasis testing to provide more information about a patient’s hemostasis status, resulting in improved clinical decision-making. In addition, advanced hemostasis testing supports hospital efforts to reduce the risks, complications and costs associated with unnecessary blood component transfusions.
Haemonetics’ TEG® hemostasis analyzer systems are advanced diagnostic tools that provide a comprehensive assessment of a patient’s overall hemostasis. This information enables clinicians to decide the most appropriate clinical treatment for the patient to minimize blood loss and reduce clotting risk. For example, TEG analyzers have been used to support clinical decision making in open cardiovascular surgery and organ transplantation, becoming the “gold standard” in liver transplants. In more recent years, interest has grown into the utilization of TEG in trauma and other procedures in which the risk of hemorrhage and thrombosis are high.
Geographically, TEG systems have achieved the highest market penetration in North America, Europe and China. However, there are considerable growth opportunities in these as well as other markets, as TEG systems become more established as the standard of care around the world.

Cell Processing
Cell Salvage Market - In recent years, more efficient blood use and less invasive surgeries have reduced demand for autotransfusion in these procedures and contributed to intense competition in mature markets, while increased access to healthcare in emerging economies has provided new markets and sources of growth.
Orthopedic procedures have seen similar changes with improved blood management practices, including the use of tranexamic acid to treat and prevent post-operative bleeding, have significantly reduced the number of transfusions and autotransfusion.
Geographically, the Cell Saver® has achieved the highest market penetration in North America, Europe and Japan. However, there are considerable growth opportunities in certain Asia Pacific and other emerging markets as addressable procedure volumes grow and the use of autotransfusion is becoming accepted as a standard of care.
Transfusion Management Market - Revenues from BloodTrack® have increased in the U.S. and Europe recently as hospitals seek means to improve efficiencies and meet compliance guidelines for tracking and dispositioning blood components to patients. SafeTrace Tx® leading market share in the U.S. remains steady with potential opportunity to expand internationally.

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to the last day of March. Fiscal 2018 and 2017 include 52 weeks with each quarter having 13 weeks. Fiscal 2016 includes 53 weeks with each of the first three quarters having 13 weeks and the fourth quarter having 14 weeks.
Net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 2.0% compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effects of foreign exchange, net revenues increased 1.1% compared with fiscal 2017 as revenue increases in Plasma, Hemostasis Management and Cell Processing were partially offset by declines in our Blood Center business unit.
Net revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased 2.5% compared with fiscal 2016. Without the effects of foreign exchange, net revenues decreased 1.2% compared with fiscal 2016. Revenue increases in Plasma and Hemostasis Management were offset by declines in Blood Center and Cell Processing for the fiscal year ended April 1, 2017. The 53rd week in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease, as it accounted for approximately 2% of additional revenue as compared with fiscal 2017.
We recorded operating income during fiscal 2018, as compared with an operating loss during fiscal 2017. Operating income increased primarily as a result of a decrease in asset impairments in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017, as well as an increase in gross profit. This operating income was partially offset by increased restructuring and turnaround costs associated with the 2018 Program and increased investments in research and development and sales and marketing primarily in our Hospital and Plasma business units.

Table of Contents

During fiscal 2017, operating loss decreased 55.9% compared with fiscal 2016. Without the effects of foreign currency, operating loss decreased 68.9% compared with fiscal 2016. Operating loss decreased primarily as a result of savings realized in fiscal 2017 from cost reduction initiatives, a decrease in goodwill and other asset impairment charges and a reduction in research and development spending as compared with fiscal 2016. These savings were partially offset by increased inventory charges and reserves and losses from Plasma liquid solutions.

Management's Use of Non-GAAP Measures
Management uses non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), to monitor the financial performance of the business, make informed business decisions, establish budgets and forecast future results. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Constant currency growth, a non-GAAP financial measure, measures the change in revenue between the current and prior year periods using a constant currency conversion rate. We have provided this non-GAAP financial measure because we believe it provides meaningful information regarding our results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented.

International Operations and the Impact of Foreign Exchange
Our principal operations are in the United States, Europe, Japan and other parts of Asia. Our products are marketed in approximately 90 countries around the world through a combination of our direct sales force and independent distributors and agents.
The percentage of revenue generated in our principle operating regions is summarized below:

------------- ----------- - ---- ----- ---- ----- -

 Fiscal Year
 2018 2017 2016
United States 60.7 % 59.0 % 57.2 %
Japan 7.5 % 9.0 % 9.0 %
Europe 18.2 % 18.7 % 20.7 %
Asia 12.7 % 12.4 % 12.3 %
Other 0.9 % 0.9 % 0.8 %
Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %

International sales are generally conducted in local currencies, primarily the Japanese Yen, the Euro, the Chinese Yuan and the Australian Dollar. Our results of operations are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly in the value of the Yen, the Euro and Australian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar.
We have placed foreign currency hedges based on estimates of future revenues to reduce the impacts of currency fluctuations. As compared with fiscal 2017, the effects of foreign exchange resulted in a 0.9% increase in sales in fiscal 2018. The primary reason is the relative strength of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar. For fiscal 2017, as compared with fiscal 2016, the effects of foreign exchange accounted for a 1.3% decrease in sales.
Please see section entitled “Foreign Exchange” in this discussion for a more complete explanation of how foreign currency affects our business and our strategy for managing this exposure.

Plasma
Plasma revenue increased 6.1% during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Plasma revenue increased 5.5% during fiscal 2018. This revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in sales of plasma disposables and software due to continued strong performance in the U.S. This increase was partially offset by a decline in liquid solutions revenue and a decrease in equipment revenue resulting from the divestiture of our SEBRA product line, which contributed $6.5 million in Plasma revenue during fiscal 2017.
We have continuing delays in the expansion of our liquid solutions production capacity that require us or our customers to continue to obtain alternative sources of supply. We expect purchases from these alternate sources to continue until we can complete the expansion and produce solutions at the necessary level.
Plasma revenue increased 7.6% during fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Plasma revenue increased 8.6% during fiscal 2017. The revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in sales of Plasma disposables during fiscal 2017 due to continued strong performance in the U.S. and increased sales of Plasma liquid solutions, which contributed approximately $16 million to the growth.
Blood Center
Blood Center revenue decreased 6.2% during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Blood Center revenue decreased 7.5% during fiscal 2018. The decrease, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was primarily due to declines in whole blood revenue in both Europe and the U.S. resulting from continued moderation in the rate of collections and declines in platelet revenue driven by the continued market shift toward double dose collection techniques in Japan, as well as decreased sales in Europe. Decreases in equipment revenue due to a one-time sale of equipment to the American Red Cross in the prior year period and declines in red cell revenue due to the loss of a customer contract in a prior year also contributed to the overall decrease in Blood Center.
Blood Center revenue decreased 14.4% during fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Blood Center revenue decreased 13.5% during fiscal 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by the decline in platelet revenue due to the impact of double dose collections in Japan as well as order timing in Asia and the Middle East. Decreases in red cell revenue due to price reductions in our principle red cell market in the U.S. and decreases in whole blood revenue due to declining transfusion rates and pricing pressures also contributed to the overall decline in Blood Center.

Cell Processing
Cell Processing revenue increased 2.1% during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Cell Processing revenue increased 0.5% during fiscal 2018. The increase, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was primarily due to BloodTrack growth in the U.S. and Europe and SafeTrace Tx growth in the U.S as well as equipment growth in the U.S. This increase was mostly offset by declines in OrthoPAT revenue due to better blood management which has reduced orthopedic blood loss and declines in Cell Saver revenue, primarily in Japan and Western Europe. Effective March 31, 2019, our OrthoPAT products will be discontinued and we will offer the Cell Saver Elite + as an alternative autotransfusion system for orthopedics or other medium to low blood loss procedures.
Cell Processing revenue decreased 6.3% during fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Cell Processing revenue decreased 3.8% during fiscal 2017. The decrease, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was primarily due to declines in OrthoPAT revenue in the U.S. and declines in Cell Saver revenue in Europe, partially offset by growth in China. These decreases were partially offset by increases in BloodTrack revenue in Europe.
Hemostasis Management
Revenue from our Hemostasis Management products increased 14.2% during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Hemostasis Management revenues increased 13.6% during fiscal 2018. This revenue increase was primarily attributable to the growth of TEG disposables, principally in the U.S. and China. The TEG 6s and TEG Manager® are approved for the same set of indications as the TEG 5000 in Europe, Australia and Japan. In the U.S., TEG 6s is approved for limited indications, including cardiovascular surgery and cardiology. TEG 6s continues to contribute significantly to the overall growth in Hemostasis Management in the U.S. and Europe. We are pursuing a broader set of indications for the TEG 6s in the U.S., including trauma.
Revenue from our Hemostasis Management products increased 11.2% during fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. Without the effect of foreign exchange, Hemostasis Management revenues increased 13.8% during fiscal 2017. This revenue increase was primarily attributable to the growth of TEG disposables, principally in the U.S. and China.

% of net revenues 45.6 % 42.7 % 44.7 %

Gross profit increased 8.8% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effects of foreign exchange, gross profit increased 6.4% during fiscal 2018. Gross profit margin percentage increased by 290 basis points for fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in the gross profit margin during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to favorable mix, partially offset by continued manufacturing challenges, the impact of the divestiture of SEBRA and increased depreciation expense. The negative impact of asset impairments, inventory charges and the whole blood filter recall on the prior year period also contributed to the overall increase in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin continues to be impacted by the inefficiency of underutilized production capacity. We continue to seek opportunities to rationalize our manufacturing network.
In fiscal 2018, we incurred costs associated with inventory purchases from alternate sources as a result of delays in the expansion of our liquid solutions production capacity. We expect purchases from these alternate sources to continue until we can complete the expansion and produce solutions at the necessary level.
Gross profit decreased 6.8% during fiscal 2017 as compared with fiscal 2016. Without the effects of foreign exchange, gross profit decreased 4.3% during fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin percentage decreased by 200 basis points for fiscal 2017 as compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in the gross profit margin during fiscal 2017 was primarily due to inventory reserves and impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2017, losses from Plasma liquid solutions and price reductions in our Blood Center business. The negative impact of currency and the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 as well as the effect of the whole blood filter recall and the inefficiency of underutilized productive capacity also contributed to the overall decline. These decreases were partially offset by cost savings initiatives and a reduction in restructuring and turnaround costs.

Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased 4.5% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effects of foreign exchange, research and development expenses increased 5.5% during fiscal 2018. The increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by higher restructuring and turnaround costs associated with the 2018 Program and our continued investment of resources in clinical programs, primarily in Hemostasis Management. These increased costs were partially offset by reduced spending on certain software projects and several projects in Blood Center to better align with our long-term product plans.
Research and development expenses decreased 16.5% during fiscal 2017 as compared with fiscal 2016. Without the effects of foreign exchange, research and development expenses decreased 16.6% during fiscal 2017. The decrease in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by reduced spending on several projects in our Blood Center business unit to better align with our long-term product plans and global strategic review. Changes in the timing of spending from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 also contributed to the decline. This decrease was partially offset by increased restructuring and turnaround costs.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.9% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017. Without the effects of foreign exchange, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.4% during fiscal 2018. The increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily the result of higher restructuring and turnaround costs associated with the 2018 Program, an increase in investments, primarily in Hemostasis Management and next generation plasma collection and software systems, and an increase in variable compensation and stock-based compensation expense. This increase was partially offset by annualized savings as a result of the prior year restructuring initiative.
During fiscal 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4.9% with and without the effects of foreign exchange. The decrease in fiscal 2017 was primarily the result of cost reduction initiatives and a reduction in restructuring and turnaround costs. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in variable compensation.
Impairment of Assets
During fiscal 2018, we did not record any material asset impairments within operating expenses.
We recorded asset impairments of $58.6 million in fiscal 2017, which consisted of $57.0 million of goodwill impairment, $0.8 million of intangible asset impairments and $0.8 million of property, plant and equipment impairments.
Interest and Other Expense, Net
Interest and other expense, net, decreased 44.1% during fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017 and decreased 14.6% during fiscal 2017 as compared with fiscal 2016. These decreases were primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of principal payments on our term loan and a reduction in borrowings on our revolving credit line. The effective interest rate on total debt outstanding for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 was approximately 3.19%.

 Fiscal Year
 2018 2017 2016 % Increase/(Decrease) 18 vs. 17 Increase/(Decrease) 17 vs. 16
Reported income tax rate 23.6 % 4.4 % (4.0 )% 19.2 % 8.4 %

Reported Tax Rate
We report our results of operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and the United States. Historically, our reported tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate due primarily to our jurisdictional mix of earnings as the income earned in our foreign subsidiaries is generally taxed at a lower tax rate. In fiscal 2015, we established a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not realizable due to cumulative losses in the U.S. In fiscal 2017, we established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in four additional jurisdictions. These jurisdictions are located in the countries of Switzerland, Puerto Rico, Luxembourg and France. The decision to establish a valuation allowance in these additional jurisdictions was largely based upon our worldwide cumulative loss position, resulting from significant impairment and restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2017 and 2016. We maintain a partial valuation allowance against our net U.S. deferred tax assets and net deferred tax assets of certain foreign subsidiaries.
For the year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $14.1 million on our worldwide pre-tax income of $59.6 million, resulting in a reported tax rate of 23.6%. Our effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2018 is higher than our effective tax rates of 4.4% and (4.0)% for the years ended April 1, 2017 and April 2, 2016, respectively. Our increase in tax rate for fiscal 2018, as compared with fiscal 2017, is primarily the result of the impact of U.S. tax reform (tax expense related to the transition tax liability partially offset by the release of valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets) changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the impact of goodwill impairments in fiscal 2017. The fiscal 2017 rate was higher than the fiscal 2016 tax rate due to the establishment of valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions fiscal 2017, changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the impact of goodwill impairments recorded in the prior years.
Income Tax Reform
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in the United States. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of March 31, 2018, we have not yet completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act. However, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and one-time transition tax. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we recognized a provisional tax expense amount of $2.0 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss).
In addition to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate and the one-time transition tax, which we have accounted for with provisional estimates as of March 31, 2018, we will also continue to analyze and monitor the other impacts of the Act that become effective for the Company in fiscal 2019 including the provisions related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income, Foreign Derived Intangible Income, Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, as well as other provisions that would limit the deductibility of future expenses.

On November 1, 2017, we launched the 2018 Program. Under this restructuring initiative, we expect to incur aggregate charges between $50 million and $60 million, of which we expect $35 million to $40 million will consist of severance and other employee costs and the remainder will consist of other exit costs, primarily related to third party services. These charges, substantially all of which will result in cash outlays, will be incurred as the specific actions required to execute on these initiatives are identified and approved and are expected to continue through fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2018, we incurred $36.6 million of restructuring and turnaround costs under this program.
During fiscal 2017, we launched a multi-year restructuring initiative (the "2017 Program") designed to reposition our organization and improve our cost structure. During fiscal 2018 and 2017, we incurred $7.2 million and $28.7 million, respectively, of restructuring and turnaround charges under this program. As of March 31, 2018, charges associated with the 2017 Program were substantially complete.
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations and proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Although cash flow from operations could be negatively impacted by continued declines in our Blood Center business, we believe these sources are sufficient to fund our cash requirements over at least the next twelve months. Our expected cash outlays relate primarily to investments, capital expenditures, including production of the NexSys PCS, Plasma plant capacity expansions, share repurchases, cash payments under the loan agreement, restructuring and turnaround initiatives and other acquisitions. These are described in more detail in Contractual Obligations below.
As of March 31, 2018, we had $180.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which is held in the U.S. or in countries from which it can be freely repatriated to the U.S. We currently have a credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") with certain lenders (together, “Lenders”) that provides for a $379.4 million term loan ("Term Loan") and a $100.0 million revolving loan ("Revolving Credit Facility" and together with the Term Loan, the "Credit Facilities"). Interest is based on the Adjusted LIBOR plus a range of 1.125% to 1.500% depending on achievement of leverage ratios and customary credit terms that include financial and negative covenants. The Credit Facilities mature on July 1, 2019. At March 31, 2018, $253.7 million was outstanding under the Term Loan and no amount was outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. We also have $45.9 million of uncommitted operating lines of credit to fund our global operations under which there are no outstanding borrowings as of March 31, 2018.
During fiscal 2018, we paid $61.7 million in scheduled principal repayments for the Term Loan. We have scheduled principal payments of $194.4 million required during of fiscal 2019. We were in compliance with the leverage and interest coverage ratios specified in the Credit Agreement as well as all other bank covenants as of March 31, 2018.

(1)The balance sheet is affected by spot exchange rates used to translate local currency amounts into U.S. dollars. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have eliminated the effect of foreign currency throughout our cash flow statement, except for its effect on our cash and cash equivalents.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $220.4 million during fiscal 2018, an increase of $60.6 million as compared with fiscal 2017. Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, and a working capital inflow resulting from a decrease in inventories due to an overall improvement in our demand planning process. An increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which was largely driven by restructuring and turnaround reserves associated with the 2018 Program and variable compensation, as well as decreases in other current assets also contributed to the cash inflow.

35

Table of Contents

Net cash provided by operating activities was $159.7 million during fiscal 2017, an increase of $37.9 million as compared with fiscal 2016. Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses which was driven largely by an increase in variable compensation and an accrual recorded in fiscal 2017 for the product recall claims. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in other current assets including a receivable related to stock options exercised near the period end date and an insurance receivable associated with the product recall.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $63.0 million during fiscal 2018, a decrease of $10.3 million as compared with fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the proceeds received related to the divestiture of our SEBRA product line and to a lesser extent a reduction in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017.
Net cash used in investing activities was $73.3 million during fiscal 2017, a decrease of $31.5 million as compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was largely the result of a reduction in capital expenditures of $26.3 million in fiscal 2017 as compared with fiscal 2016 primarily due to the completion of certain manufacturing initiatives in the prior year and decreased spending in capitalized research and development projects. Acquisition costs of $3.0 million incurred in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $120.6 million during fiscal 2018, an increase of $60.2 million as compared with fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to $100.0 million of share repurchases and an incremental $19.0 million of principal repayments on our Term Loan as compared with the prior year. These increases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a reduction in borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility of $50.0 million in fiscal 2017 and an incremental $7.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017.
Net cash used in financing activities was $60.4 million during fiscal 2017, a decrease of $2.2 million as compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to $61.0 million of share repurchases and $21.3 million principal repayments on our Term Loan in the prior year. Fiscal 2017 also benefited by an incremental $15.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options over the prior year. These decreases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a reduction in borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility of $50.0 million and $42.7 million principal repayments on our Term Loan in fiscal 2017.

(1) Includes amounts we are committed to spend on purchase orders entered in the normal course of business for capital equipment and for the purpose of manufacturing our products including contract manufacturers, specifically JMS Co. Ltd., Kawasumi Laboratories and Sanmina Corporation for the manufacture of certain disposable products and equipment. The majority of our operating expense spending does not require any advance commitment.

Included within purchase commitments in the table above is an additional $9.0 million that was paid to Pall Corporation in May 2018 upon the delivery and acceptance of certain manufacturing assets related to the filter media business. Refer to Note 20, Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
The above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. We cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these long-term liabilities due to factors outside of our control, such as tax examinations.

Concentration of Credit Risk
While approximately 45% of our revenue is generated by our ten largest customers, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are generally limited due to our large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas. A portion of our trade accounts receivable outside the United States, however, include sales to government-owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays and local economic conditions. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries' national economies.
We have not incurred significant losses on receivables. We continually evaluate all receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of customers or the countries' healthcare systems deteriorate such that their ability to make payments is uncertain, allowances may be required in future periods.
Legal Proceedings
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. Actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows. For a discussion of our material legal proceedings refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Inflation
We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Historically, we believe we have been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by improving our manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies, by increasing employee productivity and by adjusting the selling prices of products. We continue to monitor inflation pressures generally and raw materials indices that may affect our procurement and production costs. Increases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials.
Foreign Exchange
During fiscal 2018, 39.3% of our sales were generated outside the U.S., generally in foreign currencies, yet our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. We also incur certain manufacturing, marketing and selling costs in international markets in local currency. Our primary foreign currency exposures relate to sales denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan and Australian Dollars. We also have foreign currency exposure related to manufacturing and other operational costs denominated in Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars, Mexican Pesos and Malaysian Ringgit. The Yen, Euro, Yuan and Australian Dollar sales exposure is partially mitigated by costs and expenses for foreign operations and sourcing products denominated in foreign currencies.
Since our foreign currency denominated Yen, Euro, Yuan and Australian Dollar sales exceed the foreign currency denominated costs, whenever the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Yen, Euro, Yuan or Australian Dollar, there is an adverse effect on our results of operations and, conversely, whenever the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to the Yen, Euro, Yuan or Australian Dollar, there is a positive effect on our results of operations. For Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars Mexican Pesos and Malaysian Ringgit our primary cash flows relate to product costs or costs and expenses of local operations. Whenever the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to these foreign currencies, there is a positive effect on our results of operations. Conversely, whenever the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to these currencies, there is an adverse effect on our results of operations.
We have a program in place that is designed to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. That program includes the use of derivative financial instruments to minimize, for a period of time, the unforeseen impact on our financial results from changes in foreign exchange rates. We utilize forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Japanese Yen and Euro, and to a lesser extent Swiss Francs, Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars and Mexican Pesos. This does not eliminate the volatility of foreign exchange rates, but because we generally enter into forward contracts one year out, rates are fixed for a one-year period, thereby facilitating financial planning and resource allocation. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The final impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Standards to be Implemented
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASC Update No. 2014-09 stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASC Update No. 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). The purpose of ASC Update No. 2016-08 is to clarify the guidance on principal versus agent considerations. It includes indicators that help to determine whether an entity controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and to assist in determining when the entity satisfied the performance obligation and as such, whether to recognize a gross or a net amount of consideration in their consolidated statement of operations. The effective date and transition requirements are consistent with ASC Update No. 2014-09.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The guidance clarifies that entities are not required to assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract. ASC Update No. 2016-10 also addresses how to determine whether promised goods or services are separately identifiable and permits entities to make a policy election to treat shipping and handling costs as fulfillment activities. In addition, it clarifies key provisions in Topic 606 related to licensing. The effective date and transition requirements are consistent with ASC Update No. 2014-09.
We have reached conclusions on our accounting assessments related to the standard and finalized updates to our accounting policies, processes and controls and will adopt the new standard on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. We expect to record a net increase to opening retained earnings of up to $5 million upon adoption of Topic 606 in April 2018, primarily related to deferred revenue associated with software revenue. Software revenue accounts for approximately 8.6% of our total revenue. Overall, the adoption of Topic 606 is expected to have an immaterial impact on our fiscal 2019 results of operations. The timing of revenue recognition for our primary revenue stream, disposables, will not materially change.
Additionally, we completed our assessment of new disclosure requirements. Upon adoption of Topic 606, we will provide additional disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, specifically related to disaggregated revenue, contract balances and performance obligations. We designed new internal controls that will be implemented in the first quarter of 2019 to address risks associated with applying the five-step model. Additionally, we established monitoring controls to identify new sales arrangements and changes in our business environment that could impact our current accounting assessment.
Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASC Update No. 2016-02 is intended to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease asset and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, including those previously classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASC Update No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2020. Earlier adoption is permitted. The impact of adopting ASC Update No. 2016-02 on our financial position and results of operations is being assessed by management.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flow (Topic 230). The guidance reduces diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASC Update 2016-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets, other than inventory, in the income statement as income tax expense (or benefit) in the period in which the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for annual periods

beginning after December 15, 2017, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. The impact of adopting ASC Update No. 2016-16 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715). The guidance revises the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. The impact of adopting ASC Update No. 2017-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting (Topic 718). The guidance clarifies when to account for a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award as a modification. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. The impact of adopting ASC Update No. 2017-09 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (Topic 815). The new guidance will make more financial and non-financial hedging strategies eligible for hedge accounting as well as amend the presentation and disclosure requirements and change how companies assess effectiveness. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. The impact of adopting ASC Update No. 2017-12 on our financial position and results of operations is being assessed by management.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and/or estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
The accounting policies identified as critical are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenues from product sales, software and services in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and ASC Topic 985-605, Software. These standards require that revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery, including customer acceptance, has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We may have multiple contracts with the same customer and each contract is typically treated as a separate arrangement. When more than one element such as equipment, disposables and services are contained in a single arrangement, we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element’s relative selling price, provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting. An item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. The selling price of the undelivered elements is determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately, or in cases when the item is not sold separately, by third-party evidence of selling price or by management's best estimate of selling price. For our software arrangements accounted for under the provisions of ASC 985-605, Software, we establish fair value of undelivered elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence.
We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum potential rebate or discount that could be earned. In circumstances where we provide upfront rebate payments to customers, we capitalize the rebate payments and amortize the resulting asset as a reduction of revenue using a systematic method over the life of the contract.
We generally recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses on a percentage-of-completion basis which requires us to make reasonable estimates of the extent of progress toward completion of the contract. These arrangements most often include providing customized implementation services to our customer. We also provide other services, including in some instances hosting, technical support and maintenance, for the payment of periodic, monthly, or quarterly fees. We recognize these fees and charges as earned, typically as these services are provided during the contract period.

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized. Instead goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter for each of our reporting units.
In fiscal 2017, we early adopted ASC Update No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topics ("Topic 350"): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. Under this amendment, entities perform their goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then by assessing whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill impairment are organized primarily based on operating segments and geography and include: (a) North America Plasma, (b) North America Blood Center, (c) North America Hospital, (d) Europe, Middle East and Africa (collectively "EMEA"), (e) Asia-Pacific and (f) Japan. The North America Plasma reporting unit is a separate operating segment with dedicated segment management due to the size and scale of the Plasma business unit.
When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets that relate to a reporting unit’s operations and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.
We use the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because the use of the income approach typically generates a more precise measurement of fair value than the market approach. In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our discounted cash flow analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our discounted cash flow analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows. We corroborated the valuations that arose from the discounted cash flow approach by performing both a market multiple valuation and by reconciling the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization at the time of the test.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test under the guidelines of ASC Update No. 2017-04. The results of the goodwill impairment test performed indicated that the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. There were no reporting units at risk of impairment as of the fiscal 2018 annual test date.
During fiscal 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $57.0 million associated with our North America Blood Center reporting unit, which represented the entire goodwill balance associated with this reporting unit. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $66.3 million associated with the EMEA reporting unit. At the time the impairment assessment was performed, this represented the entire goodwill balance of this reporting unit. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, management reorganized its operating segments such that certain components of the All Other operating segment became components of the EMEA operating segment. As a result, we transferred $20.5 million of goodwill to the EMEA operating segment, which represented the portion of the goodwill associated with these components. Refer to Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding the goodwill impairments recorded.
We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment at least annually or more frequently if certain conditions arise to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, or that a change in the remaining useful life is required. Conditions indicating that an impairment exists include

but are not limited to a change in the competitive landscape, internal decisions to pursue new or different technology strategies, a loss of a significant customer or a significant change in the marketplace including prices paid for our products or the size of the market for our products.
When an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset (asset group) exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset (asset group), we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified.
We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group).
If we determine the estimate of an intangible asset's remaining useful life should be reduced based on our expected use of the asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over the revised estimated useful life.
We did not incur any intangible asset impairments during fiscal 2018. During 2017 and 2016, we determined that there were potential impairment indicators for certain intangible assets subject to amortization. As such, we performed the recoverability test described above for the relevant asset groups. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, we determined that the undiscounted cash flows did not support the carrying value of certain identified asset groups and made the decision to discontinue the use of and investment in these assets. Accordingly, we recorded impairment charges of $4.8 million and $25.8 million, respectively, in fiscal 2017 and 2016. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Inventory Provisions
We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared with forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Additionally, uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.
Income Taxes
The income tax provision is calculated for all jurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax provision process involves calculating current taxes due and assessing temporary differences arising from items that are taxable or deductible in different periods for tax and accounting purposes and are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for realizability and a valuation allowance is maintained for the portion of our deferred tax assets that are not more-likely-than-not realizable. All available evidence, both positive and negative, has been considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed against the deferred tax assets. Significant weight has been given to our consolidated worldwide cumulative loss position for the current and prior two years. Refer to Note 5, Income Taxes for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balances including a discussion of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.
We file income tax returns in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Our financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. We record a liability for the portion of unrecognized tax benefits claimed that we have determined are not more-likely-than-not realizable. These tax reserves have been established based on management's assessment as to the potential exposure attributable to our uncertain tax positions as well as interest and penalties attributable to these uncertain tax positions. All tax reserves are analyzed quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that result in changes in judgment.
We evaluate at the end of each reporting period whether some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested. We recognize deferred income tax liabilities to the extent that management asserts that undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are not permanently reinvested or will not be permanently reinvested in the future. Our position is based upon several factors including management’s evaluation of the Company and its subsidiaries’ financial requirements, the short term and long-term operational and fiscal objectives of the Company and the tax consequences associated with the repatriation of earnings.
Contingencies

41

Table of Contents

We may become involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement, product liability and environmental matters. Accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings, employee related litigation, self-insurance and other claims are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates. When a loss is probable and a range of loss is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period, as additional information is available. When we are initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, we record the minimum amount of loss, which could be zero. As information becomes known, additional loss provision is recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased. When events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected, our best estimate is changed to a lower amount.

NOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Hedge Accounting and Hedging Programs We recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. We evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Balance Sheet Hedging--Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities We also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest...

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell's U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell's U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell's U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").

["). Interest is based on the Adjusted LIBOR plus a range of 1.125% to 1.500% depending on achievement of leverage ratios and customary credit terms that include financial and negative covenants. The Credit Facilities mature on July 1, 2019. At March 31, 2018, $253.7 million was outstanding under the Term Loan and no amount was outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility. We also have $45.9 million of uncommitted operating lines of credit to fund our global operations under which there are no outstanding borrowings as of March 31, 2018.
During fiscal 2018, we paid $61.7 million in scheduled principal repayments for the Term Loan. We have scheduled principal payments of $194.4 million required during of fiscal 2019. We were in compliance with the leverage and interest coverage ratios specified in the Credit Agreement as well as all other bank covenants as of March 31, 2018.

(1)The balance sheet is affected by spot exchange rates used to translate local currency amounts into U.S. dollars. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have eliminated the effect of foreign currency throughout our cash flow statement, except for its effect on our cash and cash equivalents.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $220.4 million during fiscal 2018, an increase of $60.6 million as compared with fiscal 2017. Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in net income, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization, and a working capital inflow resulting from a decrease in inventories due to an overall improvement in our demand planning process. An increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, which was largely driven by restructuring and turnaround reserves associated with the 2018 Program and variable compensation, as well as decreases in other current assets also contributed to the cash inflow.

Table of Contents

Net cash provided by operating activities was $159.7 million during fiscal 2017, an increase of $37.9 million as compared with fiscal 2016. Cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses which was driven largely by an increase in variable compensation and an accrual recorded in fiscal 2017 for the product recall claims. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an increase in other current assets including a receivable related to stock options exercised near the period end date and an insurance receivable associated with the product recall.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $63.0 million during fiscal 2018, a decrease of $10.3 million as compared with fiscal 2017. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the proceeds received related to the divestiture of our SEBRA product line and to a lesser extent a reduction in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017.
Net cash used in investing activities was $73.3 million during fiscal 2017, a decrease of $31.5 million as compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in cash used in investing activities was largely the result of a reduction in capital expenditures of $26.3 million in fiscal 2017 as compared with fiscal 2016 primarily due to the completion of certain manufacturing initiatives in the prior year and decreased spending in capitalized research and development projects. Acquisition costs of $3.0 million incurred in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $120.6 million during fiscal 2018, an increase of $60.2 million as compared with fiscal 2017. This increase was primarily due to $100.0 million of share repurchases and an incremental $19.0 million of principal repayments on our Term Loan as compared with the prior year. These increases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a reduction in borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility of $50.0 million in fiscal 2017 and an incremental $7.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2018 as compared with fiscal 2017.
Net cash used in financing activities was $60.4 million during fiscal 2017, a decrease of $2.2 million as compared with fiscal 2016, primarily due to $61.0 million of share repurchases and $21.3 million principal repayments on our Term Loan in the prior year. Fiscal 2017 also benefited by an incremental $15.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options over the prior year. These decreases in net cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a reduction in borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility of $50.0 million and $42.7 million principal repayments on our Term Loan in fiscal 2017.

Ltd., Kawasumi Laboratories and Sanmina Corporation for the manufacture of certain disposable products and equipment. The majority of our operating expense spending does not require any advance commitment.

Included within purchase commitments in the table above is an additional $9.0 million that was paid to Pall Corporation in May 2018 upon the delivery and acceptance of certain manufacturing assets related to the filter media business. Refer to Note 20, Subsequent Event to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
The above table does not reflect our long-term liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits of $2.9 million recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. We cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these long-term liabilities due to factors outside of our control, such as tax examinations.

Concentration of Credit Risk
While approximately 45% of our revenue is generated by our ten largest customers, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are generally limited due to our large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas. A portion of our trade accounts receivable outside the United States, however, include sales to government-owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays and local economic conditions. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries']:
NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Operations Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as a hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers ("VARs"), systems integrators ("SIs"), independent software vendors ("ISVs"), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product.

Legal Proceedings
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. Actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows. For a discussion of our material legal proceedings refer to Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Inflation
We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Historically, we believe we have been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by improving our manufacturing and purchasing efficiencies, by increasing employee productivity and by adjusting the selling prices of products. We continue to monitor inflation pressures generally and raw materials indices that may affect our procurement and production costs. Increases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials.
Foreign Exchange
During fiscal 2018, 39.3% of our sales were generated outside the U.S., generally in foreign currencies, yet our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. We also incur certain manufacturing, marketing and selling costs in international markets in local currency. Our primary foreign currency exposures relate to sales denominated in Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan and Australian Dollars. We also have foreign currency exposure related to manufacturing and other operational costs denominated in Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars, Mexican Pesos and Malaysian Ringgit. The Yen, Euro, Yuan and Australian Dollar sales exposure is partially mitigated by costs and expenses for foreign operations and sourcing products denominated in foreign currencies.
Since our foreign currency denominated Yen, Euro, Yuan and Australian Dollar sales exceed the foreign currency denominated costs, whenever the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to the Yen, Euro, Yuan or Australian Dollar, there is an adverse effect on our results of operations and, conversely, whenever the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to the Yen, Euro, Yuan or Australian Dollar, there is a positive effect on our results of operations. For Swiss Francs, Canadian Dollars Mexican Pesos and Malaysian Ringgit our primary cash flows relate to product costs or costs and expenses of local operations. Whenever the U.S. Dollar strengthens relative to these foreign currencies, there is a positive effect on our results of operations. Conversely, whenever the U.S. Dollar weakens relative to these currencies, there is an adverse effect on our results of operations.
We have a program in place that is designed to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. That program includes the use of derivative financial instruments to minimize, for a period of time, the unforeseen impact on our financial results from changes in foreign exchange rates. We utilize forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the anticipated cash flows from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Japanese Yen and Euro, and to a lesser extent Swiss Francs, Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars and Mexican Pesos. This does not eliminate the volatility of foreign exchange rates, but because we generally enter into forward contracts one year out, rates are fixed for a one-year period, thereby facilitating financial planning and resource allocation. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The final impact of currency fluctuations on the results of operations is dependent on the local currency amounts hedged and the actual local currency results.

Standards to be Implemented
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASC Update No. 2014-09 stipulates that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASC Update No. 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). The purpose of ASC Update No. 2016-08 is to clarify the guidance on principal versus agent considerations. It includes indicators that help to determine whether an entity controls the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer and to assist in determining when the entity satisfied the performance obligation and as such, whether to recognize a gross or a net amount of consideration in their consolidated statement of operations. The effective date and transition requirements are consistent with ASC Update No. 2014-09.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The guidance clarifies that entities are not required to assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract. ASC Update No. 2016-10 also addresses how to determine whether promised goods or services are separately identifiable and permits entities to make a policy election to treat shipping and handling costs as fulfillment activities. In addition, it clarifies key provisions in Topic 606 related to licensing. The effective date and transition requirements are consistent with ASC Update No. 2014-09.
We have reached conclusions on our accounting assessments related to the standard and finalized updates to our accounting policies, processes and controls and will adopt the new standard on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. We expect to record a net increase to opening retained earnings of up to $5 million upon adoption of Topic 606 in April 2018, primarily related to deferred revenue associated with software revenue. Software revenue accounts for approximately 8.6% of our total revenue. Overall, the adoption of Topic 606 is expected to have an immaterial impact on our fiscal 2019 results of operations. The timing of revenue recognition for our primary revenue stream, disposables, will not materially change.
Additionally, we completed our assessment of new disclosure requirements. Upon adoption of Topic 606, we will provide additional disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, specifically related to disaggregated revenue, contract balances and performance obligations. We designed new internal controls that will be implemented in the first quarter of 2019 to address risks associated with applying the five-step model. Additionally, we established monitoring controls to identify new sales arrangements and changes in our business environment that could impact our current accounting assessment.

The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASC Update 2016-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740).

The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and is applicable to us in fiscal 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period. The impact of adopting ASC Update No. 2017-12 on our financial position and results of operations is being assessed by management.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While all of these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations, we view certain of these policies as critical. Policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and/or estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
The accounting policies identified as critical are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenues from product sales, software and services in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("]:
NOTE 15. DEBT Our long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands): -------------------------------- --------- --------- ---- --------- - --------- 2017 2016 Notes $ 1,882,479 $ 1,879,083 Fair value of interest rate swap (1,058 ) 13,117 Adjusted carrying value of Notes 1,881,421 1,892,200 Senior Notes In February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives. 92  ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the "2025 Notes").
