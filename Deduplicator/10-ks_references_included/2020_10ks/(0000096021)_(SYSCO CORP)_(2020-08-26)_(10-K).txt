Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
(3)This debenture is not subject to any sinking fund requirement and is no longer redeemable prior to maturity.
As of June 27, 2020, the principal payments required to be made during the next five fiscal years on total debt, excluding notes payable, are shown below:

The company has a $2.0 billion long-term revolving credit facility that expires on June 28, 2024, subject to extension. As of June 27, 2020, there were $700.0 million in borrowings outstanding under this facility. On May 20, 2020, Sysco entered into an amendment to the credit agreement providing for the long-term revolving credit facility. The amendment revises the existing credit agreement to (1) adjust the covenant requiring Sysco to maintain a certain ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest expense; (2) include a covenant requiring Sysco to maintain a certain level of liquidity until the earlier of September 2022 or the date on which Sysco has achieved a certain ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense; (3) include additional pricing levels and a 0.75% interest rate floor; and (4) include a new covenant that restricts (a) increases to Sysco’s regular quarterly dividend and (b) repurchases of equity interests of Sysco, in each case, until the earlier of September 2022 or the date on which Sysco has achieved a certain ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense.

Sysco has a commercial paper program allowing the company to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $2.0 billion. As of June 27, 2020, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding under this U.S. program. Any outstanding amounts are classified within long-term debt, as the program is supported by the long-term revolving credit facility.

Effective May 4, 2020, Sysco’s United Kingdom-based subsidiary, Brake Bros Limited, established a separate commercial paper program for the purpose of issuing short-term, unsecured Sterling-denominated notes that are eligible for purchase under the Joint HM Treasury and Bank of England Covid Corporate Financing Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed £600.0 million. As of June 27, 2020, there were £600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding under this commercial paper program. The notes bear interest at a rate of 0.454% and will mature on May 7, 2021.

Effective May 20, 2020, Sysco established a 364-day credit facility in the amount of $750.0 million scheduled to expire on May 19, 2021. As of June 27, 2020, there were no borrowings under this credit facility.

During fiscal 2020, aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances, borrowings under our long-term revolving credit facility and short-term bank borrowings ranged from approximately $18.4 million to approximately $1.9 billion.

Senior notes offering

On April 2, 2020, Sysco issued senior notes (Senior Notes) totaling $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount in order to enhance the company’s liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Details of the senior notes are as follows:

Maturity Date Par Value(in millions) Coupon Rate Pricing(percentage of par)
------------------------------------------------ ---------------------- ----------- -------------------------- - ------ -
April 1, 2025 (the 5.650% Senior Notes due 2025) $ 750 5.65 % 99.931 %
April 1, 2030 (the 5.950% Senior Notes due 2030) 1,250 5.95 99.792
April 1, 2040 (the 6.600% Senior Notes due 2040) 750 6.60 99.802
April 1, 2050 (the 6.600% Senior Notes due 2050) 1,250 6.60 99.767

Sysco used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to pay off its commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. The company anticipates using an additional portion of the net proceeds from the offering to redeem its $750 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due October 2020. The Senior Notes initially are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco’s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee Sysco’s other senior notes. Interest on the Senior Notes will be paid semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1, beginning October 1, 2020. At
Sysco’s option, any or all of the Senior Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to maturity. If Sysco elects to redeem (1) the Senior Notes maturing in 2025 before the date that is one month prior to the maturity date, (2) the Senior Notes maturing in 2030 before the date that is three months prior to the maturity date, (3) the Senior Notes maturing in 2040 before the date that is six months prior to the maturity date or (4) the Senior Notes maturing in 2050 before the date that is six months prior to the maturity date, Sysco will pay an amount equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be due if such Senior Notes matured on the applicable date described above. If Sysco elects to redeem a series of Senior Notes on or after the applicable date described in the preceding sentence, Sysco will pay an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed. Sysco will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Notes redeemed to the redemption date. The interest rate payable on each series of Senior Notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if either Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. or Fitch Ratings (or, in either case, a substitute rating agency), downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the Senior Notes, as set forth in the supplemental indentures under which the Senior Notes were issued.

On February 13, 2020, Sysco issued senior notes (the Notes) totaling $1.0 billion. Details of the Notes are as follows:

Maturity Date Par Value(in millions) Coupon Rate Pricing(percentage of par)
-------------------------------------- ---------------------- ----------- -------------------------- - ------ -
February 15, 2030 (the 2030 Notes) (1) $ 500 2.40 % 99.647 %
February 15, 2050 (the 2050 Notes) 500 3.30 99.811

(1) The net proceeds from this issuance have been and will be used to fund, in whole or in part, “Eligible Projects.” “Eligible Projects” are investments and expenditures made by Sysco in new projects and projects that have received funding in the three years prior to the issuance of the 2030 notes, which meet one or more of the following categories of eligible criteria: (1) renewable energy; (2) energy efficiency; (3) clean transportation; (4) waste reduction; (5) sustainable water and wastewater management; (6) environmentally sustainable management of living natural resources and land use/food security; (7) aquatic biodiversity conservation/food security; and (8) socioeconomic advancement and empowerment.

The Notes initially are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Sysco’s direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee Sysco’s other senior notes issued under the indenture governing the Notes or any of Sysco’s other indebtedness. Interest on the Notes will be paid semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, beginning August 15, 2020. At Sysco’s option, any or all of the Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time prior to maturity. If Sysco elects to redeem (1) the 2030 Notes before the date that is three months prior to the maturity date or (2) the 2050 Notes before the date that is six months prior to the maturity date, Sysco will pay an amount equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed. If Sysco elects to redeem a series of Notes on or after the applicable date described in the preceding sentence, Sysco will pay an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed. Sysco will pay accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed to the redemption date.

As of June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, letters of credit outstanding were $233.2 million and $226.0 million, respectively.

Employer Contributions

The company made cash contributions to its company-sponsored pension plans of $38.7 million and $37.2 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no contributions made to the U.S. Retirement Plan in fiscal 2020, as there were no required contributions to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2020. There are no required contributions to the U.S. Retirement Plan to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2021. The company’s contributions to the SERP plan are made in the amounts needed to fund current year benefit payments. The estimated aggregate fiscal 2021 contribution to fund benefit payments for the SERP plan is $31.1 million. The estimated fiscal 2021 contributions to fund benefit payments for the international retirement plans are $7 million.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

Estimated future benefit payments for vested participants, based on actuarial assumptions, are as follows:

 U.S. Pension Benefits International Pension Benefits
--------------------- --------------------- ------------------------------ - ------

 2021 $ 157,780 $ 11,831

 2025 197,783 14,237
Subsequent five years 1,120,130 74,274

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of year-end were:

 Jun. 27, 2020 Jun. 29, 2019
---------------------------------------------------- ------------- ------------- ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 2.94 % 3.70 %
Discount rate — SERP 2.91 3.62
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 1.60 2.30
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 2.56 2.56

As benefit accruals under the SERP and U.K. Retirement Plan are frozen, future pay is not projected in the determination of the benefit obligation as of June 27, 2020 or June 29, 2019.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net company-sponsored pension costs for each fiscal year were:

 2020 2019 2018
---------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- - ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 3.70 % 4.28 % 4.19 %
Discount rate — SERP 3.62 4.41 4.08
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 2.30 2.85 2.60
Expected rate of return — U.S. Retirement Plan 5.00 5.00 7.00
Expected rate of return — U.K. Retirement Plan 4.55 4.55 4.55
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 2.56 2.62 2.62

For guidance in determining the discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans, Sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the company-sponsored pension plans. Sysco uses an annualized corporate bond yield curve to estimate the rate at which pension benefits could effectively be settled to estimate a discount rate for the U.K. Retirement Plan. The discount rate assumption is updated annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rates to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2021 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 2.94% and 1.60%, respectively. The discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2021 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the SERP is 2.91%.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the retirement plans are net return on assets assumption, representing gross return on assets less asset management expenses. Specific to the U.S. Retirement Plan, administrative expenses are also excluded from the gross return on assets. The expected return for the U.S. Retirement Plan is derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, the historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. The expected return for the U.K. Retirement Plan is derived from a long-term swap yield time horizon adjusted for the expected return based on the plan’s current asset allocation and historical results. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected long-term rate of return to be used in the calculation of fiscal 2021 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 4.75% and 2.55%, respectively.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy

The company’s overall strategic investment objectives for the U.S. Retirement Plan are to preserve capital for future benefit payments and to balance risk and return commensurate with ongoing changes in the valuation of plan liabilities using an investment strategy that closely aligns the duration of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s assets with the duration of its liabilities. In order to accomplish these objectives, the company oversees the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investment objectives and policy design, decides proper plan asset class strategies and structures, monitors the performance of plan investment managers and investment funds and determines the proper investment allocation of pension plan contributions. The strategy results in an asset portfolio that more closely matches the behavior of the liability, thereby reducing the volatility of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s funded status. This structure ensures the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investments are diversified within each asset class, in addition to being diversified across asset classes with the intent to build asset class portfolios that are structured without strategic bias for or against any subcategories within each asset class. The company has also created a set of investment guidelines for the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investment managers to specify prohibited transactions, including borrowing of money except for real estate, private equity or hedge fund portfolios where leverage is a key component of the investment strategy and permitted in the investments’ governing documents, the purchase of securities on margin unless fully collateralized by cash or cash equivalents or short sales, pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating of any securities, except for loans of securities that are fully collateralized, market timing transactions and the direct purchase of the securities of Sysco or the investment manager. The purchase or sale of derivatives for speculation or leverage is also prohibited; however, investment managers are allowed to use derivative securities so long as they do not increase the risk profile or leverage of the manager’s portfolio.

The U.S. Retirement Plan’s target and actual investment allocation as of June 27, 2020 is as follows:

U.S. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Growth assets 30 % 28 %
Liability hedging assets 70 72
 100 %

Sysco’s U.S. Retirement Plan investment strategy is implemented through a combination of balanced and specialized investment managers, passive investment funds and actively managed investment funds. Growth assets include, but are not limited to, equities, alternatives, real estate, and growth fixed income intended to generate returns in excess of the liability growth rate. The Liability Hedging assets will be comprised primarily of fixed income investments, including interest rate and credit derivatives, intended to reduce funded status volatility due to changes in interest rates and credit spreads, while generating returns consistent with the projected liability growth rate. The U.S. Retirement Plan’s portfolio includes investment funds which are selected based on each fund’s stated investment strategy to align with Sysco’s overall target mix of investments. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

The day-to-day management of the assets of the U.K. Retirement Plan has been delegated by the plan trustee to a solvency manager who decides the composition of the asset portfolio in line with the objectives of the plan’s trustee and within specific investment guidelines agreed upon with the trustee. The primary objective for the U.K. Retirement Plan is to provide sufficient assets to pay benefits as they fall due. In fiscal 2020, the U.K. Retirement Plan had a return objective that was aimed to achieve a return on plan assets of 2.3% in excess of the return on the liability benchmark over rolling five-year periods. In
fiscal 2021, this return objective aims to achieve a return on plan assets of 2.1% in excess of the return on the liability benchmark over rolling five-year periods. The liability benchmark is the portfolio of gilts, which are bonds issued by the British government, that best matches the liability profile of the U.K. Retirement Plan. The investment objective includes a risk statement that targets a level of investment tracking error versus the liability benchmark to be below 10% per year. The actual tracking error targeted may fluctuate over time as the composition of the portfolio changes and the levels of risk in markets change. The U.K. Retirement Plan’s Trustee and Solvency Manager seeks to achieve the Plan’s investment objectives by investing in a suitably diversified mix of assets. The U.K. Retirement Plan uses derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps and options for risk management and for the efficient implementation of the investment strategy.

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s target and actual investment allocation as of June 27, 2020 is as follows:

U.K. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Common contractual fund 60 % 52 %
Liability hedging assets 40 48
 100 %

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s investment strategy is implemented primarily through a common contractual investment fund and liability hedging assets both managed by the solvency manager. The pooled investment fund consists of investment types including (1) equity investments covering a range of geographies and including investment managers that hold long and short positions and private equity investments, (2) credit investments including global investment grade and high yield bonds, loans and other debt and derivative securities, (3) property investments including global direct or indirect real estate holdings, (4) macro-oriented funds that seek to generate return by going long and short in a variety of markets and operate strategies which focus on markets rather than individual stocks and often use derivatives rather than physical assets, and (5) multi-strategy funds which combine a range of different credit, equity and macro-orientated ideas and dynamically allocate funds across asset classes. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

As discussed above, the retirement plans’ investments in equities, debt instruments and alternative investments provide a range of returns and also expose the plan to investment risk. However, the investment policies put in place by the trustee and solvency manager ensure diversification of plan assets across issuers, industries and countries.

Fair Value of Plan Assets

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e. an exit price). See Note 6, “Fair Value Measurements,” for a description of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities held by Sysco’s retirement plans measured at fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents: Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these investments. Cash and cash equivalents is included as a Level 1 and Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Equity securities: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market. If a stock is not listed on a public exchange, such as an American Depository Receipt or some preferred stocks, the stock is valued using an evaluated bid price based on a compilation of observable market information. Inputs used include yields, the underlying security “best price,” adjustments for corporate actions and exchange prices of underlying and common stock of the same issuer. Equity securities valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market are classified as a Level 1 measurement in the table below.

Fixed income securities: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market. Inputs used vary by type of security, but include spreads, yields, rate benchmarks, rate of prepayment, cash flows, rating changes and collateral performance and type. All fixed income securities are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Investment funds: Represents collective trust and funds holding debt, equity, hedge funds, private equity funds, exchange-traded real estate securities, and common contractual funds which are valued at the net asset value (NAV) provided by the manager of each fund. The NAV for funds within the U.S. and U.K Retirement Plans is calculated as the underlying net assets owned by the fund, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying
securities within the fund. Non-exchange traded real estate funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying real estate investments held by each fund. Each real estate investment is valued on the basis of a discounted cash flow approach. Inputs used include future rental receipts, expenses and residual values from a market participant view of the highest and best use of the real estate as rental property. The private equity funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying private equity investments held by each fund. The hedge funds are valued based on the hedge funds’ proportionate share of the net assets of the underlying private investment fund as determined by the underlying private investment fund’s general partner. Indirectly held investments are valued utilizing the latest financial reports supplied by the fund’s portfolio investments. Directly held investments are valued initially based on transaction price and are adjusted utilizing available market data and investment-specific factors, such as estimates of liquidation value, prices of recent transactions in the same or similar issuer, current operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment, changes in market outlook and the financing environment.

Derivatives: Valuation method varies by type of derivative security.

•Credit default and interest rate swaps: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information. Inputs used for credit default swaps include spread curves and trade data about the credit quality of the counterparty. Inputs used for interest rate swaps include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, and interdealer broker rates. Credit default and interest rate swaps are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Foreign currency contracts: Valued using a standardized interpolation model that utilizes the quoted prices for standard-length forward foreign currency contracts and adjusts to the remaining term outstanding on the contract being valued. Foreign currency contracts are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Futures and option contracts: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market for exchange-traded futures and options. Over-the-counter options are valued using pricing models that are based on observable market information. Exchange-traded futures and options are included as a Level 1 measurement in the table below; over-the-counter options are included as a Level 2 measurement.

Individually Significant Plans

The following information relates to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans that Sysco has determined to be individually significant to the company. As noted below, the company has determined only one plan – the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan – as currently being individually significant to the company. To determine individually significant plans, the company evaluated several factors, including Sysco’s significance to the plan in terms of employees and contributions, the funded status of the plan and the size of the company’s potential withdrawal liability if it were to voluntarily withdraw from the plan.

The following table provides information about the funded status of individually significant plans:
•The “EIN-PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN).
•The “Pension Protection Act Zone Status” columns provide the two most recent Pension Protection Act zone statuses available from each plan. The zone status is based on information that the company received from the plan’s administrators and is certified by each plan’s actuary, together with information included in the annual return/reports filed by each plan with the U.S. Department of Labor. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the orange zone are both less than 80% funded and have an accumulated funding deficiency or are expected to have a deficiency in any of the next six plan years, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. The Multiemployer Protection Act of 2014 created a new zone called “critical and declining.” Plans are generally considered “critical and declining” if they are projected to become insolvent within 15 years.
•The “FIP/RP Status” column indicates whether a financial improvement plan (FIP) for yellow/orange zone plans or a rehabilitation plan (RP) for red zone plans is pending or implemented in the current year or was put in place in a prior year. A status of “Pending” indicates a FIP/RP has been approved but actual period covered by the FIP/RP has not begun. A status of “Implemented” means the period covered by the FIP/RP began in the current year or is ongoing.
•The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether a surcharge was paid during the most recent annual period presented for the company’s contributions to each plan in the red zone. If the company’s current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with a plan satisfies the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented RP, then the payment of surcharges is not required and “No” will be reflected in this column. If the company’s current CBA with a plan does not yet satisfy the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented RP, then the payment of surcharges is required and “Yes” will be reflected in this column.

(1)Sysco is party to 23 CBAs that require contributions to the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust. Each agreement covers anywhere from less than 1% to 17% of the total contributions Sysco is required to pay the fund.

The following table provides information about the company’s contributions to individually significant plans:

•The “Sysco Contributions” columns provide contribution amounts based on Sysco’s fiscal years, which may not coincide with the plans’ fiscal years.

•The “Sysco 5% of Total Plan Contributions” columns indicate whether Sysco was listed on Schedule R of the plan’s most recently filed Form 5500s as providing more than five percent of the total contributions to the plan, and the plan year-end is noted.

NEDs may elect to receive up to 100% of their annual directors’ fees in Sysco common stock on either an annual or deferred basis. As a result of such elections, a total of 4,187, 10,672 and 21,478 shares with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $75.46, $67.45 and $54.69 per share were issued in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in the form of fully vested common stock or deferred units. The total fair value of common stock issued as a result of election shares and deferred units distributed during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0.2 million, $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Common stock shares are valued on their vesting date. Vested deferred units are valued on their subsequent conversion and distribution date.

Non-vested as of June 29, 2019 3,287,741 $ 58.40

2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Sysco ESPP permits employees to invest in Sysco common stock by means of periodic payroll deductions at a discount of 15% from the closing price on the last business day of each calendar quarter. The total number of shares that may be sold pursuant to the ESPP may not exceed 79,000,000 shares, of which 5,149,259 remained available as of June 27, 2020. In order to enhance the company’s liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sysco will temporarily reduce the discount applied to the common stock to 5% commencing fiscal 2021.

During fiscal 2020, 1,089,296 shares of Sysco common stock were purchased by the participants, as compared to 986,631 shares purchased in fiscal 2019 and 1,078,597 shares purchased in fiscal 2018. The weighted average fair value of employee stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the ESPP was $10.03, $10.17 and $8.38 per share during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value of the stock purchase rights was calculated as the difference between the stock price at date of issuance and the employee purchase price.

All Share-Based Payment Arrangements

The total share-based compensation cost included in operating expenses in the consolidated results of operations was $42.2 million, $104.9 million and $93.8 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The company’s expense related to its PSUs decreased, as the performance metrics either resulted in a below target payment for fiscal 2020 or are trending below target for awards not yet paid. The total income tax benefit for share-based compensation arrangements was $7.0 million, $21.7 million and $19.4 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

As of June 27, 2020, there was $79.3 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.91 years.

Cash received from option exercises and ESPP participation was $227.6 million, $253.1 million and $268.8 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $25.4 million, $32.4 million and $38.4 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Income Tax Disclosure [Abstract]
INCOME TAXES

 (In thousands)
U.S. $ 742,332 $ 1,910,549 $ 1,765,793
Foreign (448,948) 95,287 190,431
Total $ 293,384 $ 2,005,836 $ 1,956,224

The income tax provision for each fiscal year consists of the following:

 2020 2019 2018
---------------------------- -------------- ------- ------ ------- - -------
 (In thousands)
U.S. federal income taxes $ 128,576 $ 262,940 $ 399,254

Foreign income taxes (59,196) (5,210) 63,534
Total $ 77,909 $ 331,565 $ 525,458

The current and deferred components of the income tax provisions for each fiscal year are as follows:

 2020 2019 2018
-------- -------------- --------- ------- ------- - -------
 (In thousands)
Current $ 269,226 $ 458,284 $ 337,550
Deferred (191,317) (126,719) 187,908
Total $ 77,909 $ 331,565 $ 525,458

The deferred tax provisions result from the effects of net changes during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Significant components of Sysco’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

 Jun. 27, 2020 Jun. 29, 2019
------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------- - --------
 (In thousands)
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss carryforwards $ 379,620 $ 274,231
Pension 184,616 157,670
Receivables 99,540 17,383
Deferred compensation 31,603 29,694
Share-based compensation 21,296 39,218
Inventory 17,069 12,139
Self-insured liabilities 3,409 16,496
Other 41,820 34,366
Deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 778,973 581,197
Valuation allowances (137,862) (127,807)
Total deferred tax assets 641,111 453,390
Deferred tax liabilities:
Goodwill and intangible assets 329,940 358,847
Excess tax depreciation and basis differences of assets 169,920 163,123
Other 33,737 22,892
Total deferred tax liabilities 533,597 544,862
Total net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 107,514 $ (91,472)

The company’s deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards as of June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 consisted of state and foreign net operating tax loss carryforwards. The state net operating loss carryforwards outstanding as of June 27, 2020 expire in fiscal years 2021 through 2039. The foreign net operating loss carryforward periods vary by jurisdiction, from 17 years to unlimited.

The company assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets each period by considering whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The company considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation allowance is required. As a result of the company’s analysis, it was concluded that, as of June 27, 2020, a valuation allowance of $137.9 million should be established against the portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to certain foreign and United States (U.S.) state losses. The company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in the reassessment of the likelihood that net operating loss carryforwards will be realized.

Effective Tax Rates

Reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rates for each fiscal year are as follows:

 2020 2019 2018
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------ ------ ------ - ----- -
U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 28.00 %
State and local income taxes, net of any applicable federal income tax benefit 5.69 3.35 2.48
Foreign income taxes (2.46) (1.42) 0.07
Uncertain tax position (1.44) (0.31) (0.22)
Tax benefit of equity-based compensation (9.77) (2.07) (2.66)
Nondeductible impairment charges 17.65 — —
Impact of U.S. Tax Reform — (4.64) 0.13
Other (4.12) 0.62 (0.95)
Effective income tax rate 26.55 % 16.53 % 26.85 %

The effective tax rate of 26.55% for fiscal 2020 was impacted by the tax benefits attributable to equity compensation exercises. Our foreign operations are subject to their earnings being taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate, as well as credits, local permanent differences and other minimum taxes which resulted in a net decrease in the effective tax rate. Nondeductible asset impairment charges have an unfavorable impact. Included within “Other” is the effect of certain non-deductible expenses in the U.S. jurisdiction as well as the impact of U.S. tax credits, return to accrual adjustments and U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.

The effective tax rate of 16.53% for fiscal 2019 was favorably impacted by the reduction of the statutory rate in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, the excess tax benefits attributable to equity compensation exercises and the favorable impact of $95.1 million of foreign tax credits included within Impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. These credits fully offset our transition tax liability, as well as a reduction of the statutory tax rate in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Foreign earnings taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate had the impact of decreasing the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate of 26.85% for fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), as well as a reduction of the statutory tax rate in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Foreign earnings taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate.

Uncertain Tax Positions

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:

 2020 2019
----------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------- - ------
 (In thousands)
Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 26,109 $ 12,195
Additions for tax positions related to prior years — 20,508
Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (2,974) (6,086)
Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities — (508)
Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 23,135 $ 26,109

As of June 27, 2020, the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was $4.1 million. As of June 29, 2019, the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was $4.6 million. The expense recorded for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was not material in any year presented. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain of the company’s unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease in the next twelve months. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made.

If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of June 27, 2020, approximately $22.4 million of the $23.1 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of June 29, 2019, approximately $24.8 million of the $26.1 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the company’s unrecognized tax
positions will increase or decrease in the next twelve months either because Sysco’s positions are sustained on audit or because the company agrees to their disallowance. Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax benefits primarily include the consideration of various filing requirements in various jurisdictions and the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recognized within the next twelve months may decrease due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain years in various jurisdictions; however, it is possible that a jurisdiction may open an audit on one of these years prior to the statute of limitations expiring. Sysco anticipates an immaterial decrease to the reserve within twelve months as a result of lapse of statutes.

Sysco’s federal tax returns for 2018 and subsequent tax years have statutes of limitations that remain open for audit. As of June 27, 2020, Sysco’s tax returns in the majority of the state and local and material foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit for the years before 2012.

Other

Sysco intends to indefinitely reinvest income of its foreign operations, and, as a result, no accruals have been made with respect to the tax effects of unremitted earnings, including impacts of outside basis differences, withholding taxes any distributions may be subject to or residual U.S. income taxes, if any. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, unremitted earnings prior to the effective date of the act have been subject to U.S. income tax. Any residual tax effects are immaterial to the financial statements.

The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The company’s provision for income taxes reflects income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent book versus tax basis differences, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.

Sysco has contracts with various third-party service providers to receive information technology services. The services have been committed for periods up to fiscal 2026 and may be extended. As of June 27, 2020, the total remaining cost of the services over that period is expected to be approximately $321.7 million. A portion of this committed amount may be reduced by Sysco utilizing less than estimated resources and can be increased by Sysco utilizing more than estimated resources. Certain agreements allow adjustments for inflation. Sysco may also cancel a portion or all of the services provided subject to termination fees that decrease over time. If Sysco were to terminate all of the services in fiscal 2021, the estimated termination fees incurred in fiscal 2021 would be approximately $37.9 million.

Accounting Policies [Abstract]
Business and Consolidation Business and ConsolidationSysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions (Sysco or the company), is engaged in the marketing and distribution of a wide range of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. These services are performed for over 625,000 customers from 326 distribution facilities located throughout North America and Europe.Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ended June 27, 2020 for fiscal 2020, June 29, 2019 for fiscal 2019 and June 30, 2018 for fiscal 2018. The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of Sysco and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses. Actual results could differ from the estimates used.
Fiscal period Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 52-week year ended June 27, 2020 for fiscal 2020, June 29, 2019 for fiscal 2019 and June 30, 2018 for fiscal 2018.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash includes cash equivalents such as cash deposits, time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, high-quality money market funds and all highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less, which are recorded at fair value.
Accounts Receivable, Less Allowances Accounts Receivable, Less AllowancesAccounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables from customers and receivables from suppliers for marketing or incentive programs. Sysco determines the past due status of trade receivables based on contractual terms with each customer. Sysco evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable and determines the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. The company utilizes specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off including whether a customer has filed for or been placed in bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods. In these instances, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on an analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries.The company utilizes arrangements to sell portions of its trade accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions on a non-recourse basis. The arrangements meet the requirements for the receivables transferred to be accounted for as sales. Proceeds from the sales are reported net of negotiated discount and are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable outstanding in the company’s consolidated balance sheets and as cash flows from operating activities in the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows. The discounts and fees associated with these arrangements were not material for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2020.
Inventories InventoriesInventories consisting primarily of finished goods include food and related products and lodging products held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Elements of costs include the purchase price of the product and freight charges to deliver the product to the company’s warehouses and are net of certain cash received from vendors (see “Vendor Consideration”).
Plant and Equipment Plant and EquipmentCapital additions, improvements and major replacements are classified as plant and equipment and are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which reduces the book value of each asset in equal amounts over its estimated useful life, and is included within operating expenses in the consolidated results of operations. Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged to earnings when they are incurred. Upon the disposition of an asset, its accumulated depreciation is deducted from the original cost, and any gain or loss is reflected in current earnings.
Long-Lived Assets Long-Lived AssetsManagement reviews long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset’s useful life based on updated projections on an undiscounted basis. For assets held for use, Sysco groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured using fair value. Impairment losses for assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived IntangiblesGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of a business combination. The recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is assessed annually, or more frequently as needed when events or changes have occurred that would suggest an impairment of carrying value, by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. This annual testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment; however, if a qualitative assessment is performed and it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed.For fiscal 2020, the company utilized a qualitative assessment for certain reporting units. For the remaining reporting units, Sysco performed a quantitative test using a combination of the income and market approaches. The evaluation of fair value requires the use of projections, estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations in performing a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as assumptions regarding sales and earnings multiples that would be applied in comparable acquisitions. The company does not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future; however, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on estimated future cash flows is uncertain and will largely depend on the outcome of future events, which could result in further goodwill impairments going forward.In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the company recorded impairments to goodwill for the Pacific Star and Cake reporting units of $34.9 million and $34.2 million, respectively, which represented the full balance of goodwill for those reporting units. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the company recorded partial impairments to goodwill for the France Group and Fresh Direct reporting units of $108.7 million and $25.4 million respectively, for total fiscal 2020 impairment charges of $203.2 million, which are included within operating expenses in the consolidated results of operations.In the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 annual assessment, impairment charges would have been applicable for two reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by ranges of 17% to 29%, with goodwill of $369.5 million in the aggregate as of June 27, 2020, recorded for these reporting units.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative Financial InstrumentsAll derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets at fair value at their gross values. Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are recognized immediately in the consolidated results of operations, along with the offsetting gain or loss related to the underlying hedged item.Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a separate component of shareholders’ equity from inception of the hedges and are reclassified to the consolidated results of operations in conjunction with the recognition of the underlying hedged item.For net investment hedges, the remeasurement gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.
Investments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Investments in Corporate-Owned Life InsuranceInvestments in Corporate-Owned Life Insurance (COLI) policies are recorded at their cash surrender values as of each balance sheet date. Changes in the cash surrender value during the period are recorded as a gain or loss within operating expenses. Sysco has the ability and intent to hold certain of its COLI policies to maturity; therefore, the company does not record deferred tax balances related to cash surrender value gains or losses for these policies.
Treasury Stock Treasury StockThe company records treasury stock purchases at cost. Shares removed from treasury are valued at cost using the average cost method.
Foreign Currency Translation Foreign Currency TranslationThe assets and liabilities of all foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates. Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of AOCI (loss).
Revenue Recognition/Shipping and Handling Costs Revenue RecognitionOn July 1, 2018, Sysco adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606 with no significant impact to its financial position or results of operations, using the modified retrospective method. There were no contracts which were not completed as of July 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after July 1, 2018 are presented under ASC Topic 606, while prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Sysco had no adjustment to opening retained earnings as of July 1, 2018 as a result of adopting ASC Topic 606. There was no material impact on revenues for fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019 as a result of applying ASC Topic 606. The accounting policies and other disclosures are below, as well as the disclosure of disaggregated revenues in Note 4, “Revenue.” The company recognizes revenues when the performance obligation is satisfied, which is the point at which control of the promised goods or services are transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration Sysco expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For the majority of Sysco’s customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods have been delivered, as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfers to the customer. The timing of satisfaction of the performance obligation is not subject to significant judgment. While certain additional services may be identified within a contract, we have concluded that those services are individually immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer, and, therefore, not assessed as performance obligations.Sales tax collected from customers is not included in revenue, but rather recorded as a liability due to the respective taxing authorities. Shipping and handling costs include costs associated with the selection of products and delivery to customers and are included within operating expenses.Product Sales RevenuesSysco generates revenue primarily from the distribution and sale of food and related products to its customers. Substantially all revenue is recognized at the point in time in which the product is delivered to the customer. The company grants certain customers sales incentives, such as rebates or discounts, which are accounted for as variable consideration. The variable consideration is based on amounts known at the time the performance obligation is satisfied and, therefore, requires minimal judgment.Contract BalancesAfter completion of Sysco’s performance obligations, the company has an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in its contracts with customers. Sysco’s customer receivables will generally be collected in less than 30 days in accordance with the underlying payment terms. Customer receivables, which are included in accounts receivable, less allowances in the consolidated balance sheet, were $2.7 billion and $3.9 billion as of June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019, respectively.Sysco has certain customer contracts in which upfront monies are paid to its customers. These payments have become industry practice and are not related to financing of the customer’s business. They are not associated with any distinct good or service to be received from the customer and, therefore, are treated as a reduction of transaction prices. All upfront payments are capitalized in other assets and amortized over the life of the contract or the expected life of the relationship with the customer on a straight-line basis. As of June 27, 2020, Sysco’s contract assets were not significant. Sysco has no significant commissions paid that are directly attributable to obtaining a particular contract.Shipping and Handling CostsShipping and handling costs include costs associated with the selection of products and delivery to customers.
Vendor Consideration Vendor ConsiderationSysco recognizes consideration received from vendors as a reduction to cost of sales when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by Sysco. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, Sysco will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold.
Insurance Program Insurance ProgramSysco maintains a self-insurance program covering portions of workers’ compensation, general and vehicle liability and property insurance costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. Sysco has a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary (the Captive) with the primary purpose to enhance Sysco’s risk financing strategies by providing Sysco the opportunity to negotiate insurance premiums in the non-retail insurance market. The Captive must maintain a sufficient level of cash to fund future reserve payments and secure the insurer’s obligations for workers’ compensation, general liability and auto liability programs. The Captive holds restricted assets in order to meet solvency requirements, including a restricted investment portfolio of marketable fixed income securities, which have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale, and cash and restricted cash equivalents held in a cash deposit account. Further, Sysco has letters of credit available to collateralize the remaining liabilities not covered by restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities. The company also maintains a fully self-insured group medical program. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.
Share-Based Compensation Share-Based CompensationSysco recognizes expense for its share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted. The fair value of performance share unit awards is determined based on the target number of shares of common stock and the company’s stock price on the date of grant and subsequently adjusted based on actual and forecasted performance compared to planned targets. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option pricing methods require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. The fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are based on the company’s stock price on the date of grant. Measured compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related share-based compensation award. The method for estimating the fair value of stock options has not changed in the past three years.During the vesting period, Sysco reduces share-based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures, which is based on analysis of historical trends reviewed on an annual basis. Sysco’s estimate of forfeitures is applied at the grant level. The estimate of forfeitures is trued up to actual forfeitures at the end of each vesting period.
Income Taxes Income TaxesSysco recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized. The additional United States (U.S.) federal tax burden as a result of the global intangible low taxed income regime is accounted for as a periodic cost.The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The company’s provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as various foreign jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
Acquisitions AcquisitionsAcquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the financial statements include the results of the acquired operations from the respective dates of acquisition.The purchase price of the acquired entities is preliminarily allocated to the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition, with any excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired, including intangibles, recognized as goodwill. Subsequent changes to preliminary amounts are made prospectively.
Basis of Presentation Basis of PresentationThe financial statements include consolidated balance sheets, consolidated results of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in consolidated shareholders’ equity and consolidated cash flows. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise disclosed, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for all periods presented have been made.Sysco has interests in various jointly owned foodservice operations in Mexico, Panama and Sweden for which it consolidates the results of the operations; therefore, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for these companies have been included in Sysco’s consolidated financial statements. The value of the noncontrolling interest in each entity is considered redeemable due to certain features of the investment agreement and has, therefore, been presented as mezzanine equity, which is outside of permanent equity, in the consolidated balance sheets. The income attributable to the noncontrolling interest is located within Other expense (income), net, in the consolidated results of operations, as this amount is not ma

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flow Hedges In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of November 29, 2019, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our ant...

Employer Contributions

The company made cash contributions to its company-sponsored pension plans of $38.7 million and $37.2 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no contributions made to the U.S. Retirement Plan in fiscal 2020, as there were no required contributions to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2020. There are no required contributions to the U.S. Retirement Plan to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements in fiscal 2021. The company’s contributions to the SERP plan are made in the amounts needed to fund current year benefit payments. The estimated aggregate fiscal 2021 contribution to fund benefit payments for the SERP plan is $31.1 million. The estimated fiscal 2021 contributions to fund benefit payments for the international retirement plans are $7 million.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

Estimated future benefit payments for vested participants, based on actuarial assumptions, are as follows:

 U.S. Pension Benefits International Pension Benefits
--------------------- --------------------- ------------------------------ - ------
 (In thousands)
 2021 $ 157,780 $ 11,831
 2022 167,694 12,127

 2024 188,214 13,312
 2025 197,783 14,237
Subsequent five years 1,120,130 74,274

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of year-end were:

 Jun. 27, 2020 Jun. 29, 2019
---------------------------------------------------- ------------- ------------- ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 2.94 % 3.70 %
Discount rate — SERP 2.91 3.62
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 1.60 2.30
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 2.56 2.56

As benefit accruals under the SERP and U.K. Retirement Plan are frozen, future pay is not projected in the determination of the benefit obligation as of June 27, 2020 or June 29, 2019.

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net company-sponsored pension costs for each fiscal year were:

 2020 2019 2018
---------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- - ---- -
Discount rate — U.S. Retirement Plan 3.70 % 4.28 % 4.19 %
Discount rate — SERP 3.62 4.41 4.08
Discount rate — U.K. Retirement Plan 2.30 2.85 2.60
Expected rate of return — U.S. Retirement Plan 5.00 5.00 7.00
Expected rate of return — U.K. Retirement Plan 4.55 4.55 4.55
Rate of compensation increase — U.S. Retirement Plan 2.56 2.62 2.62

For guidance in determining the discount rate for U.S. defined benefit plans, Sysco calculates the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the company-sponsored pension plans. Sysco uses an annualized corporate bond yield curve to estimate the rate at which pension benefits could effectively be settled to estimate a discount rate for the U.K. Retirement Plan. The discount rate assumption is updated annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rates to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2021 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 2.94% and 1.60%, respectively. The discount rate to be used for the calculation of fiscal 2021 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the SERP is 2.91%.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the retirement plans are net return on assets assumption, representing gross return on assets less asset management expenses. Specific to the U.S. Retirement Plan, administrative expenses are also excluded from the gross return on assets. The expected return for the U.S. Retirement Plan is derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of rigorous historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds, the historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments. The expected return for the U.K. Retirement Plan is derived from a long-term swap yield time horizon adjusted for the expected return based on the plan’s current asset allocation and historical results. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The expected long-term rate of return to be used in the calculation of fiscal 2021 net company-sponsored benefit costs for the U.S. Retirement Plan and U.K. Retirement Plan are 4.75% and 2.55%, respectively.

Plan Assets

Investment Strategy

The company’s overall strategic investment objectives for the U.S. Retirement Plan are to preserve capital for future benefit payments and to balance risk and return commensurate with ongoing changes in the valuation of plan liabilities using an investment strategy that closely aligns the duration of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s assets with the duration of its liabilities. In order to accomplish these objectives, the company oversees the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investment objectives and policy design, decides proper plan asset class strategies and structures, monitors the performance of plan investment managers and investment funds and determines the proper investment allocation of pension plan contributions. The strategy results in an asset portfolio that more closely matches the behavior of the liability, thereby reducing the volatility of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s funded status. This structure ensures the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investments are diversified within each asset class, in addition to being diversified across asset classes with the intent to build asset class portfolios that are structured without strategic bias for or against any subcategories within each asset class. The company has also created a set of investment guidelines for the U.S. Retirement Plan’s investment managers to specify prohibited transactions, including borrowing of money except for real estate, private equity or hedge fund portfolios where leverage is a key component of the investment strategy and permitted in the investments’ governing documents, the purchase of securities on margin unless fully collateralized by cash or cash equivalents or short sales, pledging, mortgaging or hypothecating of any securities, except for loans of securities that are fully collateralized, market timing transactions and the direct purchase of the securities of Sysco or the investment manager. The purchase or sale of derivatives for speculation or leverage is also prohibited; however, investment managers are allowed to use derivative securities so long as they do not increase the risk profile or leverage of the manager’s portfolio.

The U.S. Retirement Plan’s target and actual investment allocation as of June 27, 2020 is as follows:

U.S. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Growth assets 30 % 28 %
Liability hedging assets 70 72
 100 %

Sysco’s U.S. Retirement Plan investment strategy is implemented through a combination of balanced and specialized investment managers, passive investment funds and actively managed investment funds. Growth assets include, but are not limited to, equities, alternatives, real estate, and growth fixed income intended to generate returns in excess of the liability growth rate. The Liability Hedging assets will be comprised primarily of fixed income investments, including interest rate and credit derivatives, intended to reduce funded status volatility due to changes in interest rates and credit spreads, while generating returns consistent with the projected liability growth rate. The U.S. Retirement Plan’s portfolio includes investment funds which are selected based on each fund’s stated investment strategy to align with Sysco’s overall target mix of investments. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

The day-to-day management of the assets of the U.K. Retirement Plan has been delegated by the plan trustee to a solvency manager who decides the composition of the asset portfolio in line with the objectives of the plan’s trustee and within specific investment guidelines agreed upon with the trustee. The primary objective for the U.K. Retirement Plan is to provide sufficient assets to pay benefits as they fall due. In fiscal 2020, the U.K. Retirement Plan had a return objective that was aimed to achieve a return on plan assets of 2.3% in excess of the return on the liability benchmark over rolling five-year periods. In
fiscal 2021, this return objective aims to achieve a return on plan assets of 2.1% in excess of the return on the liability benchmark over rolling five-year periods. The liability benchmark is the portfolio of gilts, which are bonds issued by the British government, that best matches the liability profile of the U.K. Retirement Plan. The investment objective includes a risk statement that targets a level of investment tracking error versus the liability benchmark to be below 10% per year. The actual tracking error targeted may fluctuate over time as the composition of the portfolio changes and the levels of risk in markets change. The U.K. Retirement Plan’s Trustee and Solvency Manager seeks to achieve the Plan’s investment objectives by investing in a suitably diversified mix of assets. The U.K. Retirement Plan uses derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps and options for risk management and for the efficient implementation of the investment strategy.

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s target and actual investment allocation as of June 27, 2020 is as follows:

U.K. Retirement Plan
------------------------ ----------------------- ----------------------- -- -
 Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation
Common contractual fund 60 % 52 %
Liability hedging assets 40 48
 100 %

The U.K. Retirement Plan’s investment strategy is implemented primarily through a common contractual investment fund and liability hedging assets both managed by the solvency manager. The pooled investment fund consists of investment types including (1) equity investments covering a range of geographies and including investment managers that hold long and short positions and private equity investments, (2) credit investments including global investment grade and high yield bonds, loans and other debt and derivative securities, (3) property investments including global direct or indirect real estate holdings, (4) macro-oriented funds that seek to generate return by going long and short in a variety of markets and operate strategies which focus on markets rather than individual stocks and often use derivatives rather than physical assets, and (5) multi-strategy funds which combine a range of different credit, equity and macro-orientated ideas and dynamically allocate funds across asset classes. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the target allocation when considered appropriate.

As discussed above, the retirement plans’ investments in equities, debt instruments and alternative investments provide a range of returns and also expose the plan to investment risk. However, the investment policies put in place by the trustee and solvency manager ensure diversification of plan assets across issuers, industries and countries.

Fair Value of Plan Assets

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (i.e. an exit price). See Note 6, “Fair Value Measurements,” for a description of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities held by Sysco’s retirement plans measured at fair value.

Cash and cash equivalents: Valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these investments. Cash and cash equivalents is included as a Level 1 and Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Equity securities: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market. If a stock is not listed on a public exchange, such as an American Depository Receipt or some preferred stocks, the stock is valued using an evaluated bid price based on a compilation of observable market information. Inputs used include yields, the underlying security “best price,” adjustments for corporate actions and exchange prices of underlying and common stock of the same issuer. Equity securities valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market are classified as a Level 1 measurement in the table below.

Fixed income securities: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market. Inputs used vary by type of security, but include spreads, yields, rate benchmarks, rate of prepayment, cash flows, rating changes and collateral performance and type. All fixed income securities are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.

Investment funds: Represents collective trust and funds holding debt, equity, hedge funds, private equity funds, exchange-traded real estate securities, and common contractual funds which are valued at the net asset value (NAV) provided by the manager of each fund. The NAV for funds within the U.S. and U.K Retirement Plans is calculated as the underlying net assets owned by the fund, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying
securities within the fund. Non-exchange traded real estate funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying real estate investments held by each fund. Each real estate investment is valued on the basis of a discounted cash flow approach. Inputs used include future rental receipts, expenses and residual values from a market participant view of the highest and best use of the real estate as rental property. The private equity funds are valued based on the proportionate interest held by the U.S. Retirement Plan, which is based on the valuations of the underlying private equity investments held by each fund. The hedge funds are valued based on the hedge funds’ proportionate share of the net assets of the underlying private investment fund as determined by the underlying private investment fund’s general partner. Indirectly held investments are valued utilizing the latest financial reports supplied by the fund’s portfolio investments. Directly held investments are valued initially based on transaction price and are adjusted utilizing available market data and investment-specific factors, such as estimates of liquidation value, prices of recent transactions in the same or similar issuer, current operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment, changes in market outlook and the financing environment.

Derivatives: Valuation method varies by type of derivative security.

•Credit default and interest rate swaps: Valued using evaluated bid prices based on a compilation of observable market information. Inputs used for credit default swaps include spread curves and trade data about the credit quality of the counterparty. Inputs used for interest rate swaps include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, and interdealer broker rates. Credit default and interest rate swaps are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Foreign currency contracts: Valued using a standardized interpolation model that utilizes the quoted prices for standard-length forward foreign currency contracts and adjusts to the remaining term outstanding on the contract being valued. Foreign currency contracts are included as a Level 2 measurement in the table below.
•Futures and option contracts: Valued at the closing price reported on the exchange market for exchange-traded futures and options. Over-the-counter options are valued using pricing models that are based on observable market information. Exchange-traded futures and options are included as a Level 1 measurement in the table below; over-the-counter options are included as a Level 2 measurement.

The following table presents the fair value of the U.S. Retirement Plan’s assets by major asset category as of June 27, 2020:

Individually Significant Plans

The following information relates to multiemployer defined benefit pension plans that Sysco has determined to be individually significant to the company. As noted below, the company has determined only one plan – the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Plan – as currently being individually significant to the company. To determine individually significant plans, the company evaluated several factors, including Sysco’s significance to the plan in terms of employees and contributions, the funded status of the plan and the size of the company’s potential withdrawal liability if it were to voluntarily withdraw from the plan.

The following table provides information about the funded status of individually significant plans:
•The “EIN-PN” column provides the Employer Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number (PN).
•The “Pension Protection Act Zone Status” columns provide the two most recent Pension Protection Act zone statuses available from each plan. The zone status is based on information that the company received from the plan’s administrators and is certified by each plan’s actuary, together with information included in the annual return/reports filed by each plan with the U.S. Department of Labor. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the orange zone are both less than 80% funded and have an accumulated funding deficiency or are expected to have a deficiency in any of the next six plan years, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. The Multiemployer Protection Act of 2014 created a new zone called “critical and declining.” Plans are generally considered “critical and declining” if they are projected to become insolvent within 15 years.
•The “FIP/RP Status” column indicates whether a financial improvement plan (FIP) for yellow/orange zone plans or a rehabilitation plan (RP) for red zone plans is pending or implemented in the current year or was put in place in a prior year. A status of “Pending” indicates a FIP/RP has been approved but actual period covered by the FIP/RP has not begun. A status of “Implemented” means the period covered by the FIP/RP began in the current year or is ongoing.
•The “Surcharge Imposed” column indicates whether a surcharge was paid during the most recent annual period presented for the company’s contributions to each plan in the red zone. If the company’s current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with a plan satisfies the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented RP, then the payment of surcharges is not required and “No” will be reflected in this column. If the company’s current CBA with a plan does not yet satisfy the requirements of a pending but not yet implemented RP, then the payment of surcharges is required and “Yes” will be reflected in this column.

(1)Sysco is party to 23 CBAs that require contributions to the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust. Each agreement covers anywhere from less than 1% to 17% of the total contributions Sysco is required to pay the fund.

The following table provides information about the company’s contributions to individually significant plans:

•The “Sysco Contributions” columns provide contribution amounts based on Sysco’s fiscal years, which may not coincide with the plans’ fiscal years.

•The “Sysco 5% of Total Plan Contributions” columns indicate whether Sysco was listed on Schedule R of the plan’s most recently filed Form 5500s as providing more than five percent of the total contributions to the plan, and the plan year-end is noted.

The total number of employee options granted was 3,286,943, 2,609,755 and 4,042,415 in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
During fiscal 2020, 1,554,566 and 1,732,377 options were granted to 12 executive officers and approximately 174 other key employees, respectively. During fiscal 2019, 657,341 and 1,952,414 options were granted to 9 executive officers and approximately 179 other key employees, respectively. During fiscal 2018, 955,344 and 3,087,071 options were granted to 10 executive officers and 181 other key employees, respectively.

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $10.57, $11.70 and $7.08, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $11.6 million, $14.0 million and $17.7 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, 704,732, 617,685 and 660,923 restricted stock units, respectively, were granted to employees, the majority of which will vest ratably over a three-year period. Some of these restricted stock units were granted with dividend equivalents. The fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. For restricted stock unit awards granted without dividend equivalents, the fair value was reduced by the present value of expected dividends as of the date of grant date during the vesting period. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $71.01, $63.91 and $55.81, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $30.4 million, $35.3 million and $40.4 million, respectively.

Non-Employee Director Awards

During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, 27,431, 30,870 and 35,672 restricted equity awards, respectively, were granted to non-employee directors (NEDs), which will vest over a one-year period. NEDs may elect to receive these awards in restricted stock shares that will vest at the end of the award stated vesting period or as deferred units that convert into shares of Sysco common stock on a date subsequent to the award stated vesting date selected by the NED. The fair value of the restricted awards is based on the company’s stock price as of the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value of the shares granted during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $74.17, $66.22 and $54.10, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock shares vested and deferred units distributed during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $2.0 million, $2.0 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Restricted stock shares are valued on their vesting date. Vested deferred units are valued on their subsequent conversion and distribution date.

NEDs may elect to receive up to 100% of their annual directors’ fees in Sysco common stock on either an annual or deferred basis. As a result of such elections, a total of 4,187, 10,672 and 21,478 shares with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $75.46, $67.45 and $54.69 per share were issued in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in the form of fully vested common stock or deferred units. The total fair value of common stock issued as a result of election shares and deferred units distributed during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0.2 million, $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Common stock shares are valued on their vesting date. Vested deferred units are valued on their subsequent conversion and distribution date.

As of June 27, 2020, there were 81,066 fully vested deferred units outstanding that will convert into shares of Sysco common stock upon dates selected by the respective NED.

Summary of Equity Instruments Other Than Stock Options

The following summary presents information regarding outstanding non-vested awards as of June 27, 2020 and changes during the fiscal year then ended with regard to these awards under the stock incentive plans. Award types represented include restricted stock units granted to employees, restricted awards granted to non-employee directors and PSUs.

2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Sysco ESPP permits employees to invest in Sysco common stock by means of periodic payroll deductions at a discount of 15% from the closing price on the last business day of each calendar quarter. The total number of shares that may be sold pursuant to the ESPP may not exceed 79,000,000 shares, of which 5,149,259 remained available as of June 27, 2020. In order to enhance the company’s liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sysco will temporarily reduce the discount applied to the common stock to 5% commencing fiscal 2021.

During fiscal 2020, 1,089,296 shares of Sysco common stock were purchased by the participants, as compared to 986,631 shares purchased in fiscal 2019 and 1,078,597 shares purchased in fiscal 2018. The weighted average fair value of employee stock purchase rights issued pursuant to the ESPP was $10.03, $10.17 and $8.38 per share during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value of the stock purchase rights was calculated as the difference between the stock price at date of issuance and the employee purchase price.

All Share-Based Payment Arrangements

The total share-based compensation cost included in operating expenses in the consolidated results of operations was $42.2 million, $104.9 million and $93.8 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The company’s expense related to its PSUs decreased, as the performance metrics either resulted in a below target payment for fiscal 2020 or are trending below target for awards not yet paid. The total income tax benefit for share-based compensation arrangements was $7.0 million, $21.7 million and $19.4 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

As of June 27, 2020, there was $79.3 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.91 years.

Cash received from option exercises and ESPP participation was $227.6 million, $253.1 million and $268.8 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $25.4 million, $32.4 million and $38.4 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Deferred (191,317) (126,719) 187,908
Total $ 77,909 $ 331,565 $ 525,458

The deferred tax provisions result from the effects of net changes during the year in deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

Significant components of Sysco’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

 Jun. 27, 2020 Jun. 29, 2019
------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------- - --------
 (In thousands)
Deferred tax assets:
Net operating loss carryforwards $ 379,620 $ 274,231

Total deferred tax assets 641,111 453,390
Deferred tax liabilities:
Goodwill and intangible assets 329,940 358,847
Excess tax depreciation and basis differences of assets 169,920 163,123
Other 33,737 22,892
Total deferred tax liabilities 533,597 544,862
Total net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ 107,514 $ (91,472)

The company’s deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards as of June 27, 2020 and June 29, 2019 consisted of state and foreign net operating tax loss carryforwards. The state net operating loss carryforwards outstanding as of June 27, 2020 expire in fiscal years 2021 through 2039. The foreign net operating loss carryforward periods vary by jurisdiction, from 17 years to unlimited.

The company assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets each period by considering whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The company considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation allowance is required. As a result of the company’s analysis, it was concluded that, as of June 27, 2020, a valuation allowance of $137.9 million should be established against the portion of the deferred tax asset attributable to certain foreign and United States (U.S.) state losses. The company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in the reassessment of the likelihood that net operating loss carryforwards will be realized.

Effective Tax Rates

Reconciliations of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rates for each fiscal year are as follows:

 2020 2019 2018
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------ ------ ------ - ----- -
U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 28.00 %
State and local income taxes, net of any applicable federal income tax benefit 5.69 3.35 2.48
Foreign income taxes (2.46) (1.42) 0.07
Uncertain tax position (1.44) (0.31) (0.22)
Tax benefit of equity-based compensation (9.77) (2.07) (2.66)
Nondeductible impairment charges 17.65 — —
Impact of U.S. Tax Reform — (4.64) 0.13
Other (4.12) 0.62 (0.95)
Effective income tax rate 26.55 % 16.53 % 26.85 %

The effective tax rate of 26.55% for fiscal 2020 was impacted by the tax benefits attributable to equity compensation exercises. Our foreign operations are subject to their earnings being taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate, as well as credits, local permanent differences and other minimum taxes which resulted in a net decrease in the effective tax rate. Nondeductible asset impairment charges have an unfavorable impact. Included within “Other” is the effect of certain non-deductible expenses in the U.S. jurisdiction as well as the impact of U.S. tax credits, return to accrual adjustments and U.S. taxes on foreign earnings.

The effective tax rate of 16.53% for fiscal 2019 was favorably impacted by the reduction of the statutory rate in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, the excess tax benefits attributable to equity compensation exercises and the favorable impact of $95.1 million of foreign tax credits included within Impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. These credits fully offset our transition tax liability, as well as a reduction of the statutory tax rate in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Foreign earnings taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate had the impact of decreasing the effective tax rate.

The effective tax rate of 26.85% for fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718), as well as a reduction of the statutory tax rate in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Foreign earnings taxed at rates different than our domestic tax rate had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate.

Uncertain Tax Positions

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows:

 2020 2019
----------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------- - ------
 (In thousands)
Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 26,109 $ 12,195
Additions for tax positions related to prior years — 20,508
Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (2,974) (6,086)
Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities — (508)
Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 23,135 $ 26,109

As of June 27, 2020, the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was $4.1 million. As of June 29, 2019, the gross amount of liability for accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was $4.6 million. The expense recorded for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was not material in any year presented. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain of the company’s unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease in the next twelve months. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made.

If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of June 27, 2020, approximately $22.4 million of the $23.1 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. If Sysco were to recognize all unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of June 29, 2019, approximately $24.8 million of the $26.1 million reserve would reduce the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits with respect to certain of the company’s unrecognized tax
positions will increase or decrease in the next twelve months either because Sysco’s positions are sustained on audit or because the company agrees to their disallowance. Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax benefits primarily include the consideration of various filing requirements in various jurisdictions and the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recognized within the next twelve months may decrease due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain years in various jurisdictions; however, it is possible that a jurisdiction may open an audit on one of these years prior to the statute of limitations expiring. Sysco anticipates an immaterial decrease to the reserve within twelve months as a result of lapse of statutes.

Sysco’s federal tax returns for 2018 and subsequent tax years have statutes of limitations that remain open for audit. As of June 27, 2020, Sysco’s tax returns in the majority of the state and local and material foreign jurisdictions are no longer subject to audit for the years before 2012.

Other

Sysco intends to indefinitely reinvest income of its foreign operations, and, as a result, no accruals have been made with respect to the tax effects of unremitted earnings, including impacts of outside basis differences, withholding taxes any distributions may be subject to or residual U.S. income taxes, if any. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, unremitted earnings prior to the effective date of the act have been subject to U.S. income tax. Any residual tax effects are immaterial to the financial statements.

The determination of the company’s provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The company’s provision for income taxes reflects income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. Tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent book versus tax basis differences, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and the company’s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.
