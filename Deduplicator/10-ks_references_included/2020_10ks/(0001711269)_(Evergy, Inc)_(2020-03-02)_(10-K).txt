EVERGY, INC.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Evergy is a public utility holding company incorporated in 2017 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri. Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries listed below. In September 2019, these wholly-owned direct subsidiaries were rebranded and renamed under the Evergy brand name.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Evergy Kansas Central, formerly known as Westar Energy, Inc., is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas. Evergy Kansas Central has one active wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, Evergy Kansas South, formerly known as Kansas Gas and Electric Company.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Evergy Metro, formerly known as Kansas City Power & Light Company, is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas.

Strategy
Evergy expects to continue operating its integrated utilities within the currently existing regulatory frameworks. Evergy's objectives are to deliver value to shareholders through earnings and dividend growth; serve customers and communities with cost-effective, reliable and clean energy; and maintain a rewarding and challenging work environment for employees. Significant elements of Evergy's strategy to achieve these objectives include:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the realization of a total of approximately $595 million of potential net savings over the first five years of operation of the combined company, which formed in June 2018, resulting from synergies that are expected to be created as a result of the merger;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• anticipated rate base investment of approximately $7.6 billion from 2020 through 2024; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• the reduction of carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 from 2005 levels through the continued growth of Evergy's renewable energy portfolio and the retirement of older and less efficient fossil fuel plants. See "Transforming Evergy's Generation Fleet" in Part I, Item 1, Business, for additional information.

In March 2020, the Evergy Board announced the creation of a Strategic Review & Operations Committee that will explore ways to enhance long-term shareholder value (taking into account applicable legal and regulatory requirements and any other relevant considerations), including through a potential strategic combination or an enhanced long-term standalone operating plan and strategy. The committee is expected to complete its review and make a recommendation to Evergy's Board in the first half of 2020.
See "Cautionary Statements Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information" and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
In July 2018, the Evergy Board authorized the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of Evergy's common stock. Evergy has utilized various methods to effectuate the share repurchase program since its authorization, including the repurchase of shares through ASR agreements and open market transactions. For 2019, Evergy had total repurchases of common stock of $1,628.7 million and had repurchased 28.8 million shares under the repurchase program. Since the start of the repurchase program in August 2018, Evergy has made total repurchases of common stock of $2,671.0 million and has repurchased 45.2 million shares under the repurchase program. Evergy does not anticipate making additional repurchases of common stock under its share repurchase program while the Strategic Review & Operations Committee of the Evergy Board conducts its review of ways to enhance long-term shareholder value, which is expected to conclude in the first half of 2020.
See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Evergy's common stock repurchase program.
Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central Merger
Evergy was incorporated in 2017 as Monarch Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. Prior to the closing of the merger transactions, Monarch Energy changed its name to Evergy and did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Amended Merger Agreement. On June 4, 2018, in accordance with the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy merged into Evergy, with Evergy surviving the merger and King Energy merged into Evergy Kansas Central, with Evergy Kansas Central surviving the merger. These merger transactions resulted in Evergy becoming the parent entity of Evergy Kansas Central and the direct subsidiaries of Great Plains Energy, including Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West. As a result of the closing of the merger transactions, each outstanding share of Great Plains Energy common stock was converted into 0.5981 shares of Evergy common stock, resulting in the issuance of 128.9 million shares. Additionally, each outstanding share of Evergy Kansas Central common stock was converted into 1 share of Evergy common stock.
Evergy Kansas Central was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the merger and thus, the predecessor of Evergy. Evergy had separate operations for the period beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and references to amounts for periods after the closing of the merger relate to Evergy.

Earnings Overview
The following table summarizes Evergy's net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS).

--------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ ----- ---- ---- ------ ----- ---- - -----

 2019 2018 Change
 (millions, except per share amounts)
Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. $ 669.9 $ 535.8 $ 134.1
Earnings per common share, diluted 2.79 2.50 0.29

Net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. increased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the inclusion of Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's earnings in the first five months of 2019, merger-related costs and reductions of revenue for customer bill credits incurred in June 2018 following the consummation of the merger, lower operating and maintenance expenses at fossil-fuel generating units and lower administrative and general expenses, partially offset by lower retail sales driven by unfavorable weather and higher depreciation expense.
Diluted EPS increased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the increase in net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. discussed above, partially offset by a higher number of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding in 2019, which diluted EPS by $0.34 for 2019.
For additional information regarding the change in net income, refer to the Evergy Results of Operations section within this MD&A.
Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP)
Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) for 2019 were $694.0 million or $2.89 per share, respectively. For 2018, Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) were $680.9 million or $2.54 per share, respectively. In addition to net income attributable to Evergy, Inc., diluted EPS, pro forma net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. and pro forma diluted EPS as prepared in accordance with GAAP, Evergy's management uses adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) to evaluate earnings and EPS without the costs and/or benefits resulting from rebranding, voluntary severance and significant items related to the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger.
Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of results. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on Evergy's results of operations and financial position. Management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of Evergy's results of operations and financial position. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Evergy Board.
Pensions
Evergy incurs significant costs in providing non-contributory defined pension benefits. The costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience.
Pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, life expectancies, compensation levels and employment periods), earnings on plan assets, the level of contributions made to the plan, and plan amendments. In addition, pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.
The assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted-average of long-term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan. The assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation. These assumptions, updated annually at the measurement date, are based on management's best estimates and judgment; however, material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs.
The following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 0.5% increase or a 0.5% decrease in key actuarial assumptions for Evergy's qualified pension plans. Each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only.

----------------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- ----- ------ - ---- - ----- -

 Impact on Impact on
 Projected 2020
 Change in Benefit Pension
Actuarial assumption Assumption Obligation Expense
 (millions)
Discount rate 0.5 % increase $ (197.7 ) $ (20.2 )
Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 % increase — (8.2 )
Rate of compensation 0.5 % increase 48.9 9.7
Discount rate 0.5 % decrease 223.4 22.5
Rate of return on plan assets 0.5 % decrease — 8.2
Rate of compensation 0.5 % decrease (45.7 ) (9.0 )

Pension expense for Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC. The orders allow the difference between pension costs under GAAP and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds, as appropriate.
In 2019, Evergy's pension expense was $131.3 million under GAAP and $168.7 million for ratemaking. The impact on 2020 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on GAAP pension costs. Under the Evergy Companies' rate agreements, any increase or decrease in GAAP pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset or

liability for future ratemaking treatment. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions.
Market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan. It is difficult to predict future pension costs, changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions.
Revenue Recognition
Evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount it has the right to invoice. Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by Evergy. Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month. This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs. Evergy's estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates. Evergy's unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes. See Note 4 for the balance of unbilled receivables for Evergy as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
Evergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues. Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.
Management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to Evergy; and changes in laws and regulations. If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations. Evergy's continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules. In the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of Evergy's operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided. Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Impairments of Assets and Goodwill
Long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under GAAP.
Accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value. Evergy's consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis. The annual impairment test for the $2,336.6 million of goodwill from the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger was conducted on May 1, 2019. The fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill. As a result, there was no impairment of goodwill.
The determination of fair value for the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies. The results of the two techniques

34

Table of Contents

were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit, which involves a significant amount of management judgment.
The discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions: estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows. Management determines the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the KCC and MPSC and after-tax cost of debt. Estimated future cash flows are based on Evergy's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of return on equity, anticipated returns of and earnings on future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts. Management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events. Should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions, revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of the Evergy reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill.
The market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by management's selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit, as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock. Management determines an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry. Changes in results of peer companies, selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of the Evergy reporting unit.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property. Deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards. Evergy is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in Evergy's consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities. This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ. Evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Evergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. Concurrent with the recognition of the liability, the estimated cost of the ARO incurred at the time the related long-lived assets were either acquired, placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective is also recorded to property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The recording of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability.
Evergy initially recorded AROs at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission Wolf Creek (94% indirect share), retire wind generating facilities, dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants, remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills, among other items. ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. In determining Evergy's AROs, assumptions are made regarding probable future disposal costs and the timing of their occurrence. A change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on Evergy's AROs reflected on its consolidated balance sheets.

35

Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Evergy had recorded AROs of $674.1 million and $687.1 million, respectively. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Evergy's AROs.

EVERGY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Evergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors including rate regulation, fuel costs, weather, customer behavior and demand, the economy and competitive forces.
Substantially all of Evergy's revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a significant impact on the price the Evergy Companies charge for electric service. Evergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by its ability to align overall spending, both operating and capital, within the frameworks established by its regulators.
Wholesale revenues are impacted by, among other factors, demand, cost and availability of fuel and purchased power, price volatility, available generation capacity, transmission availability and weather.
The Evergy Companies primarily use coal and uranium for the generation of electricity for their customers and also purchase power through purchase power agreements or on the open market. The prices for fuel used in generation or the market price of purchased power can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including supply, demand, weather and the broader economic environment. Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have fuel recovery mechanisms in their Kansas and Missouri jurisdictions, as applicable, that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund, through customer rates, substantially all of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding.
Weather significantly affects the amount of electricity that Evergy's customers use as electricity sales are seasonal. As summer peaking utilities, the third quarter typically accounts for the greatest electricity sales by the Evergy Companies. Hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand, especially among residential and commercial customers, and to a lesser extent, industrial customers. Mild weather reduces customer demand.
Energy efficiency investments by customers and the Evergy Companies also can affect the demand for electric service. Through the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA), Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their Missouri retail customers and recover program costs, throughput disincentive, and as applicable, certain earnings opportunities in retail rates through a rider mechanism.
The Evergy Companies' taxes other than income taxes, of which property taxes are a significant component, can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including changes in taxable values and property tax rates. Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro's Kansas jurisdiction have property tax surcharges that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund, through customer rates, substantially all of the variance in property tax costs from the amounts set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding.

Evergy Utility Gross Margin and MWh Sales
Utility gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Utility gross margin, as used by the Evergy Companies, is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs. Expenses for fuel and purchased power costs, offset by wholesale sales margin, are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms.  As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income. In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by SPP members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO.  As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the manner in which Evergy reflects SPP revenues and expenses.
Management believes that utility gross margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the Evergy Companies' operations across periods compared with operating revenues because utility gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses.  Utility gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board.  The Evergy Companies' definition of utility gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Evergy relies primarily upon cash from operations, short-term borrowings, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its capital requirements. Evergy's capital requirements primarily consist of capital expenditures, payment of contractual obligations and other commitments, the payment of dividends to shareholders and the repurchase of common shares.
Capital Sources
Cash Flows from Operations
Evergy's cash flows from operations are driven by the regulated sale of electricity. These cash flows are relatively stable but the timing and level of these cash flows can vary based on weather and economic conditions, future regulatory proceedings, the timing of cash payments made for costs recoverable under regulatory mechanisms and the time such costs are recovered, and unanticipated expenses such as unplanned plant outages and storms.
Short-Term Borrowings
As of December 31, 2019, Evergy had $1.9 billion of available borrowing capacity from its master credit facility. The available borrowing capacity under the master credit facility consisted of $429.3 million for Evergy, Inc., $736.6 million for Evergy Kansas Central, $400.7 million for Evergy Metro and $354.5 million for Evergy Missouri West. Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's borrowing capacity under the master credit facility also supports their issuance of commercial paper. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the credit facility. Along with cash flows from operations and receivable sales facilities, Evergy generally uses borrowings under its master credit facility and the issuance of commercial paper to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements. Evergy also had short-term borrowings under a term loan credit agreement that was repaid in September 2019 and is discussed further below.
In March 2019, Evergy entered into a $1.0 billion, 6-month term loan credit agreement with a group of banks to provide short-term financing for its common stock repurchase program. The agreement allowed for two term loans during the 6-month term of the agreement, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the credit limit of the agreement. At closing, Evergy borrowed $500.0 million under the agreement, allowing for one additional term loan borrowing in a principal amount up to $500.0 million, which was subsequently utilized in June 2019. In September 2019, Evergy repaid its $1.0 billion of borrowings under the term loan credit agreement with proceeds from its issuance of $1.6 billion of senior notes in September 2019.
Long-Term Debt and Equity Issuances
From time to time, Evergy issues long-term debt and equity to repay short-term debt, refinance maturing long-term debt and finance growth. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Evergy’s capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:

------------------------------ ----------- ----

 December 31
 2019 2018
Common equity 49% 57%
Noncontrolling interests
Long-term debt, including VIEs 51% 43%

Under stipulations with the MPSC and KCC, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro are required to maintain common equity at not less than 35%, 40% and 40%, respectively, of total capitalization. The master credit facility and certain debt instruments of the Evergy Companies also contain restrictions that require the maintenance of certain capitalization and leverage ratios. As of December 31, 2019, the Evergy Companies were in compliance with these covenants.
Significant Debt Issuances
See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding significant debt issuances.

Credit Ratings
The ratings of the Evergy Companies' debt securities by the credit rating agencies impact the Evergy Companies' liquidity, including the cost of borrowings under their master credit facility and in the capital markets. The Evergy Companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as vital to their access to and cost of debt financing and, to that end, maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations, financial position and future prospects. While a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of the Evergy Companies' debt, it could increase interest charges under the master credit facility. A decrease in credit ratings could also have, among other things, an adverse impact, which could be material, on the Evergy Companies' access to capital, the cost of funds, the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings, the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and Evergy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries.
As of February 20, 2020, the major credit rating agencies rated the Evergy Companies' securities as detailed in the following table.

(a) Evergy expects to make contributions to the pension and other post-retirement plans beyond 2024 but the amounts are not yet determined.

Long-term debt includes current maturities. Long-term debt principal excludes $80.7 million of unamortized net discounts and debt issuance costs and a $125.5 million fair value adjustment recorded in connection with purchase accounting for the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger. Variable rate interest obligations are based on rates as of December 31, 2019.
Operating lease commitments include leases for office buildings, computer equipment, operating facilities, vehicles and rail cars to serve jointly-owned generating units where Evergy Kansas Central or Evergy Metro is the managing partner and is reimbursed by other joint-owners for its proportionate share of the cost. Finance lease commitments include obligations for both principal and interest.
Evergy expects to contribute $131.9 million to the pension and other post-retirement plans in 2020, of which the majority is expected to be paid by Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro. Additional contributions to the plans are expected beyond 2024 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined. Amounts for years after 2020 are estimates based on information available in determining the amount for 2020. Actual amounts for years after 2020 could be significantly different than the estimated amounts in the table above.
Fuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation costs. Power commitments consist of certain commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements. Other represents individual commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business.
Evergy has other insignificant long-term liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019, which do not have a definitive cash payout date and are not included in the table above.

Common Stock Dividends
The amount and timing of dividends payable on Evergy's common stock are within the sole discretion of the Evergy Board. The amount and timing of dividends declared by the Evergy Board will be dependent on considerations such as Evergy's earnings, financial position, cash flows, capitalization ratios, regulation, reinvestment opportunities and debt covenants. Evergy targets a long-term dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the common stock dividend declared by the Evergy Board in February 2020.
The Evergy Companies also have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements, corporate organizational documents, covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restrictions on dividend payments.
Common Stock Repurchase Program
In July 2018, the Evergy Board authorized the repurchase of up to 60 million shares of Evergy's common stock. For 2019, Evergy had total repurchases of common stock of $1,628.7 million and had repurchased 28.8 million shares under the repurchase program. Since the start of the repurchase program in August 2018, Evergy has made total repurchases of common stock of $2,671.0 million and has repurchased 45.2 million shares under the repurchase program. Evergy does not anticipate making additional repurchases of common stock under its share repurchase program while the Strategic Review & Operations Committee of the Evergy Board conducts its review of ways to enhance long-term shareholder value, which is expected to conclude in the first half of 2020.

See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Evergy's common stock repurchase program.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In the ordinary course of business, Evergy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes. In connection with the closing of the merger, Evergy assumed the guarantees previously provided to Evergy Missouri West by Great Plains Energy. The majority of these agreements guarantee Evergy's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded.
At December 31, 2019, Evergy has provided $110.2 million of credit support for Evergy Missouri West as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Evergy direct guarantees to Evergy Missouri West counterparties totaling $17.0 million, which expire in 2020, and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Evergy's guarantee of Evergy Missouri West long-term debt totaling $93.2 million, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2020 to 2023.

Evergy has also guaranteed Evergy Missouri West's short-term debt, including its commercial paper program. At December 31, 2019, Evergy Missouri West had $93.4 million of commercial paper outstanding. None of the guaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings were downgraded.
The Evergy Companies also have off-balance sheet arrangements in the form of letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business.

Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our 70  ADOBE INC.

(4) Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes, excluding transaction and integration expenses and special charges, or $840.0 million, $780.1 million, and $694.1 million for the years ended November 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 32 ------------------------------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------------- Estimate for the year ending November 30, 2020 Earnings per share - diluted $5.15 to $5.25 Impact of special charges 0.05 Adjusted earnings per share - diluted $5.20 to $5.30 Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchan...

Strategy For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2020, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * The further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix, with a dual objective: to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base, and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth.

(7) Lennar Other Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on operating earnings (loss) before income taxes. Operations of the Company's homebuilding segments primarily include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Company's unconsolidated entities. Operating earnings (loss) for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and other income (expense), net, less the cost of homes sold and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the segment and loss due to litigation.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...

The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 22.2%. This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income,...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.

Impairments of Assets and Goodwill
Long-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under GAAP.
Accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment. In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value.

See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the credit facility. Along with cash flows from operations and receivable sales facilities, Evergy generally uses borrowings under its master credit facility and the issuance of commercial paper to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements. Evergy also had short-term borrowings under a term loan credit agreement that was repaid in September 2019 and is discussed further below.
In March 2019, Evergy entered into a $1.0 billion, 6-month term loan credit agreement with a group of banks to provide short-term financing for its common stock repurchase program. The agreement allowed for two term loans during the 6-month term of the agreement, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the credit limit of the agreement. At closing, Evergy borrowed $500.0 million under the agreement, allowing for one additional term loan borrowing in a principal amount up to $500.0 million, which was subsequently utilized in June 2019. In September 2019, Evergy repaid its $1.0 billion of borrowings under the term loan credit agreement with proceeds from its issuance of $1.6 billion of senior notes in September 2019.

Evergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP.

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).

Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities. This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ. Evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Asset Retirement Obligations
Evergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets.
