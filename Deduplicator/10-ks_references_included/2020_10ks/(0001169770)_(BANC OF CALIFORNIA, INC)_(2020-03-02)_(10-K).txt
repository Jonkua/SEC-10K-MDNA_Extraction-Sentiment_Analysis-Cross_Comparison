Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Critical Accounting Policies
We follow accounting and reporting policies and procedures that conform, in all material respects, to GAAP and to practices generally applicable to the financial services industry, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments and accounting estimates that affect the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, and amounts disclosed as contingent assets and liabilities. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures that are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgment and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management has identified our most critical accounting policies and accounting estimates as: investment securities, allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a description of these policies.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information on recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
The following recently issued accounting pronouncement is of material importance to us: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (ASU 2016-13) which is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this guidance replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current US GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
We have developed our models to estimate lifetime expected credit losses on our loans primarily using a lifetime loss methodology. We have used these models to execute our process for estimating the allowance for credit losses under the new standard in parallel with our existing process for estimating the allowance for credit losses based on incurred losses and have developed an appropriate governance process for our estimate of expected credit losses under the new standard. The adoption of this standard will be applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. We expect our allowance for credit losses may increase by approximately 5% to 15% from our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2019.

Financial Highlights
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, net income from continuing operations was $23.8 million, $42.1 million and $53.5 million. Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations were $0.05, $0.38 and $0.63 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The decrease in net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was mainly due to lower net interest income and noninterest income, and a higher provision for loan losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.
Total assets were $7.83 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.80 billion, or 26%, from $10.63 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to our continued progress towards transitioning to become a relationship-focused business bank. As part of this transition, we continue to de-emphasize the production of lower margin commoditized loan products and we opportunistically reduced holdings of certain investment securities.
Significant financial highlights include:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Securities available-for-sale were $912.6 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.08 billion, or 54.2%, from $1.99 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily the result of call and net sale activities between periods. We lowered the amount of collateralized loan obligations in the investment securities portfolio and repositioned our securities available-for-sale portfolio to navigate a volatile rate environment by reducing the overall duration of the portfolio by selling longer-duration residential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed-securities. The sales of securities helped remix overall earning assets as the proceeds were primarily used to fund loan originations and reduce borrowings.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Loans receivable, net of ALL, totaled $5.89 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.74 billion, or 22.84%, from $7.64 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to sales of approximately $1.13 billion in SFR mortgage and multifamily loans, coupled with net paydowns and payoffs within the portfolio.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total deposits were $5.43 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.49 billion, or 31.45%, from $7.92 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to our strategic reduction of high-rate and high-volatility deposits, partially offset by our continuous efforts to build core deposits across our business units, including strong growth from the community banking and private banking channel.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Total stockholders' equity was $907.2 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $38.3 million, or 4.05%, from $945.5 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily the result of the partial redemption of our Series D and Series E Preferred Stock for an aggregate amount of $46.0 million and cash dividends on common stock and preferred stock of $15.6 million, partially offset by $12.2 million of other comprehensive income on securities available-for-sale primarily due to decreases in market interest rates and net income of $23.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.

For the quarters ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, net income from continuing operations was $14.3 million, $10.8 million, and $10.9 million. Diluted earnings from continuing operations per total common share were $0.20, $0.12, and $0.11 for the quarters ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Refer to the 2018 Form 10-K filed on March 2, 2019 for discussion related to 2018 activity compared to 2017 activity.

(1) Total loans includes income from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net interest income was $248.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $38.6 million, or 13.5%, from $286.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in net interest income between periods was largely due to the net decrease in interest earning assets coupled with average cost of interest-bearing liabilities outpacing the increase in average yield on interest-earning assets. Net interest income was impacted by increases in overall interest rates that occurred in late 2018 and remained stable through the first half of 2019 before a series of 25 bps rate reductions in target federal funds rates during the last half of 2019.
Interest income on total loans was $333.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $4.0 million, or 1.2%, from $329.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest income on loans was positively impacted by $8.4 million as a result of the 12 bps increase in average yield to 4.76% primarily due to higher interest rates on new loans and variable rate loans repricing in the higher interest rate environment through the end of 2018 and the first part of 2019. Offsetting the positive impact of changes in the loan yield was a $4.4 million decrease in interest on loans due to the $93.3 million decrease in the average balance of total loans as loan sales and principal paydowns and payoffs outpaced new originations.
Interest income on securities was $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $35.4 million, or 42.4%, from $83.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in interest income on securities was due to a $1.00 billion decrease in average balance which lowered interest income by $38.5 million, partially offset by a 14 bps increase in average yield which increased interest income by $3.0 million. The decrease in average balance was mainly due to sales of certain longer-duration and fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities in response to the changing interest rate environment and our effort to remix our earning assets from investment securities to higher yielding loans. The increase in average yield was due to higher interest rates on purchased investment securities and investment securities with variable interest rates increasing due to a higher interest rate environment for the first half of 2019.
Dividends and interest income on other interest-earning assets was $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $914 thousand, or 9.2%, from $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in dividends and interest income on other interest-earning assets was due to an 8 bps decrease in average yield, coupled with a $23.3 million

decrease in average balance. The decrease in average yield was mainly due to lower interest rates on interest-earning deposits with financial institutions. The decrease in average balance was mainly due to reductions in asset levels, including required FHLB stock levels and lower interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions.
Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was $101.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $9.9 million, or 10.8%, from $91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest expense on interest-bearing deposits was due to a 35 bps increase in average cost, partially offset by a $653.0 million decrease in average interest-bearing balances. The increase in average cost was mainly due to depositors benefiting from the increases in overall interest rates that occurred in late 2018 and remained stable through the first half of 2019 before a series of 25 bps rate reductions in target federal funds rates during the last half of 2019. The decrease in average interest-bearing balances was mainly due to the shift in our deposit strategy to focus on relationship-based clients and de-emphasize high-rate transactional clients.
Interest expense on FHLB advances was $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.7 million, or 7.7%, from $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was due mainly to a $362.7 million decrease in average balance, partially offset by a 40 bps increase in average cost for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in average balance was mainly due to the maturity of $125.0 million in term advances, and reductions in overnight and short-term advances of $200.0 million based on available cash resulting from our sales of investment securities and loans during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in average cost was mainly due to the impact of the rising interest rate environment throughout 2018 and related term advances entered into during 2018 that remained outstanding throughout 2019.
Interest expense on securities sold under repurchase agreements was $62 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $971 thousand, or 94.0%, from $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We used a lower amount of repurchase agreements during the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of cash received from sales of loans and securities over the past year used to redeem our higher yield borrowings, including securities sold under repurchase agreements.
Interest expense on long term debt and other interest-bearing liabilities was $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $46 thousand, or 0.5%, from $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average balance and average cost remained relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the previous year.

Provision for Loan Losses
The provision for loan losses is charged to operations to adjust the allowance for loan losses to the level required to cover estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.
We recorded a provision for loan losses of $36.4 million and $30.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The 2019 loan loss provision of $36.4 million was primarily attributable to a previously reported $35.1 million charge-off of a line of credit originated in November 2017 to a borrower purportedly the subject of a fraudulent scheme. On October 22, 2019, in connection with this matter, the Bank filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (Case CV '19 02031 GPC KSC) seeking to recover its losses and other monetary damages against Chicago Title Insurance Company and Chicago Title Company, asserting claims under RICO, 18 U.S.C § 1962 and for RICO Conspiracy, Fraud, Aiding and Abetting Fraud, Negligent Misrepresentation, Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Negligence. We are actively considering and pursuing available sources of recovery and other potential means of mitigating the loss; however, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in that regard.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we undertook an extensive collateral review of all commercial lending relationships $5 million and above not secured by real estate, consisting of 53 loans representing $536 million in commitments. The collateral review focused on security and collateral documentation and confirmation of the Bank's collateral interest. The review was performed by the Bank's internal audit department and the work was validated by an independent third party. Our review and outside validation did not identify any other instances of apparent fraud for the credits reviewed or concerns over the existence of collateral held by the Bank or on our behalf at third parties; however, there are no assurances that our internal review and third party validation are sufficient to identify all such issues.
The 2018 provision for loans losses of $30.2 million includes a $13.9 million charge-off on a line of credit determined to have been fraudulently obtained, and was otherwise a result of the 15.6% net loan portfolio growth, higher classified loans of 97.8% and allowance methodology enhancements implemented during 2018, such as an extension of look-back period, more granular qualitative adjustments and loan segmentations, and an annual update of the loss emergence period.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Noninterest income was $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $11.8 million, or 49.3%, from $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in noninterest income was mainly due to lower loan servicing income of $3.0 million, higher net loss on the sale of investment securities of $10.4 million, and lower other income of $8.9 million, partially offset by lower impairment losses on investment securities of $2.5 million and higher net gain on sale of loans of $5.9 million.
Loan servicing income was $679 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 81.7%, from $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease between periods was attributable to the sale during the year ended December 31, 2018 of $28.5 million of mortgage servicing rights on $3.55 billion in unpaid principal balances of conventional mortgage loans. Servicing fees were $1.3 million and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Servicing fees were offset by losses on fair value changes and runoff of servicing assets of $612 thousand and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Net (loss) gain on sale of securities available-for-sale was $(4.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We sold securities available-for-sale of $1.20 billion and $406.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities of $132.2 million for a gain of $9 thousand, agency mortgage-backed securities of $423.6 million for a loss of $5.0 million and collateralized loan obligations of $644.0 million for a net gain of $143 thousand. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized $731 thousand of other-than-temporary impairment on the MBS portfolio, which is reflected in impairment loss on investment securities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we changed our intent to sell our non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities which were in an unrealized loss position and recognized $3.3 million of OTTI losses.
Net gain on sale of loans was $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold jumbo SFR mortgage loans of $382.8 million resulting in a gain of $787 thousand and multifamily residential loans of $751.6 million resulting in a gain of $11.7 million. Offsetting these gains was $4.4 million related to establishing reserves for expected loan repurchases associated with our multifamily securitization. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold SFR mortgage loans of $293.6 million with a gain of $1.2 million, SBA loans of $6.3 million with a gain of $480 thousand and multifamily and other consumer loans of $86.6 million with a gain of $207 thousand.
Net loss on sale of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) was zero for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold $28.5 million of MSRs on $3.55 billion in unpaid principal balances of conventional mortgage loans. These transactions resulted in a net loss on sale of MSRs of $2.3 million, primarily related to transaction costs, provision for early repayments of loans and expected repurchase obligations under standard representations and warranties. There were no sales of MSRs during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other income was $874 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $8.9 million decrease is primarily attributable to a $9.6 million realized loss on interest rate swaps related to the securitization of $573.5 million in multifamily loans which was completed during the third quarter of 2019. In connection with the securitization, during the second quarter of 2019, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional value of $543.4 million to offset variability in the fair value of the related loans as a result of changes in

market interest rates. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we realized a loss of $9.0 million related to these swap agreements due to a decline in interest rates since their execution and was offset by the $8.9 million gross gain realized on the loans sold into the securitization, which is included in net gain on sale of loans. The swap agreements were closed at the time the loans were sold into the securitization.

Total noninterest expense $ 195,914 $ 232,785 $ 308,268

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Noninterest expense was $195.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $36.9 million, or 15.8%, from $232.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, outside services, advertising, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring expense, all other expense and loss on investments in alternative energy partnerships, partially offset by a reduction in reversal of provision for loan repurchases.
Salaries and employee benefits expense was $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 3.7%, from $110.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to decreases in number of employees, commissions, and temporary staff expenses, offset by annual pay increases.
Professional fees were $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $21.4 million, or 63.7%, from $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in professional fees was due in part to overall decreases in professional fees as we continue to focus on managing our noninterest expense. Professional fees also included $28.3 million of insurance recoveries related to securities litigation, indemnification, investigation and other legal expenses during the 2019 period, compared to $18.0 million during 2018.
Outside service fees were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 63.6%, from $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower loan subservicing costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of the aforementioned sale of mortgage servicing rights on $3.55 billion in unpaid principal balances of conventional mortgage loans during the comparable 2018 period.
Advertising costs were $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 33.5%, from $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to a focus on digital rather than traditional marketing resulting in overall reductions in advertising expense. Advertising costs include $6.7 million of the LAFC naming rights commitment during both of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Reversal of provision for loan repurchases was $660 thousand and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The decrease was mainly due to the aforementioned sale of mortgage servicing rights on $3.55 billion in unpaid principal balances of conventional mortgage loans and reduced loan repurchase settlement activities.

Restructuring expense was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and consisted of severance and retention costs associated with the exit from our third-party mortgage origination and brokered single family lending business and CEO and CFO transitions during 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, restructuring expense was $4.4 million and consisted of severance-related costs as a result of the reduction in workforce that was previously implemented in 2018 to reduce our workforce by approximately 9% of total staff.
All other expenses were $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $621 thousand, or 4.0%, from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower provision for unfunded loan commitments and overall expense reductions.
Loss on investments in alternative energy partnerships was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $3.4 million from $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in loss was mainly due to decreased loss sharing allocations resulting in lower Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) losses.

Income Tax Expense
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, income tax expense (benefit) from continuing operations was $4.2 million, $4.8 million and $(26.6) million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was 15.1 percent, 10.3 percent and (98.8) percent, respectively.
Our effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was higher than the effective tax rate of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 mainly due to the reduction in the recognition of tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships, which were $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The reduction in tax credits received by the Bank is due to fewer investments in alternative energy partnerships. We use the flow-through income statement method to account for the tax credits earned on investments in alternative energy partnerships. Under this method, the tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense and the initial book-tax difference in the basis of the investments is recognized as additional tax expense in the year they are earned.

Financial Condition

Investment Securities
Investment securities that we have the ability and the intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. All
other securities are classified as available-for-sale. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at their estimated fair values with the changes in fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, as a component of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, all of our investment securities were classified as available-for-sale.
The primary goal of our investment securities portfolio is to provide a relatively stable source of interest income while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Certain investment securities provide a source of liquidity as collateral for FHLB advances, Federal Reserve Discount Window capacity, repurchase agreements and for certain public deposits.
The following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of the investment securities portfolio and the corresponding amounts of gross unrealized gains and losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of the dates indicated:

Securities available-for-sale were $912.6 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.08 billion, or 54.2%, from $1.99 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to sales of $1.20 billion, principal payments of $36.5 million, and calls and pay-offs of $53.1 million, partially offset by purchases of $195.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Securities available-for-sale had a net unrealized loss of $16.9 million and $34.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, in response to a changing interest rate environment we repositioned our securities available-for-sale portfolio by reducing the overall duration through sales of certain longer-duration and fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities. Additionally, we continued to strategically reduce our collateralized loan obligations exposure. A portion of the funds from sales of investment securities during 2019 and other available cash balances were reinvested into a mix of security classes, resulting in an overall shorter duration for the securities portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, our securities portfolio included $718.4 million of CLOs, $91.3 million of agency collateralized mortgage obligations, $36.5 million of agency mortgage-backed securities, $52.7 million of municipal securities, and $13.6 million of corporate debt securities.
CLOs totaled $718.4 million and $1.42 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The $703.2 million decrease between periods was due primarily to call and sale activities. CLOs are floating rate debt securities backed by pools of senior secured commercial loans to a diverse group of companies across a broad spectrum of industries. Underlying loans are generally secured by a company’s assets such as inventory, equipment, property, and/or real estate. CLOs are structured to diversify exposure to a broad sector of industries. The payments on these commercial loans support interest and principal on the CLOs across classes that range from AAA rated to equity tranches. We believe that our CLO portfolio, consisting entirely of variable rate securities, supports our interest rate risk management strategy by lowering the extension risk and duration risk inherent to certain fixed rate investment securities. At December 31, 2019, we owned AAA and AA rated CLOs and did not own CLOs rated below AA. As all CLOs are also rated above investment grade credit ratings and were diversified across issuers, we believe that these CLOs enhance our liquidity position. We also maintain pre-purchase due diligence and ongoing review processes by a dedicated credit administration team. The ongoing review process includes monitoring of performance factors including external credit ratings, collateralization levels, collateral concentration levels and other performance factors. We only acquire CLOs that it believes are Volcker Rule compliant.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we changed our intent to sell our U.S. government agency and U.S. government sponsored enterprise residential mortgage-backed securities due to our strategy to reposition the securities profile and shorten the duration of certain securities within the portfolio. As a result, we recognized $731 thousand of OTTI for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we changed our intent to sell our non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in an unrealized loss position due to our strategy to reposition our securities profile and recognized $3.3 million of OTTI for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, all of our investment securities in an unrealized loss position had received an investment grade credit rating.

Loans Held-for-Sale
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, loans held-for-sale carried at fair value are mainly repurchased conforming SFR mortgage loans that were previously sold. Loans held-for-sale carried at fair value on a consolidated operations basis were $22.6 million and $27.2 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The $4.5 million, or 16.7%, decrease was primarily due to sales of $6.2 million, partially offset by loan repurchases of $1.9 million.
Loans held-for-sale carried at fair value included in assets of discontinued operations related to the Banc Home Loans division which was sold in 2017 and totaled zero and $19.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Loans held-for-sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value on a consolidated operations basis were zero and $426 thousand at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Loans held-for-sale carried at the lower of cost or fair value are mainly non-conforming jumbo mortgage loans and SBA loans. The change in balance between periods was due to payoffs.

Total loans were $5.95 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.75 billion, or 22.7%, from $7.70 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to payoffs and sales of non-relationship loans, while we focus on originating new high quality relationship loans that contribute to a changing mix in our loan portfolio. The decline in commercial and industrial loans is due primarily to payoffs and lower average outstanding balances on credit lines. The $746.7 million decrease in multifamily loans was primarily the result of sales, including the securitization of $573.5 million in multifamily loans during the third quarter of 2019. The decline in SFR loans is due mostly to decreased originations, sales and accelerated payoffs as loans have refinanced in the lower rate environment. See "Loan Originations, Purchases and Repayments" for the origination detail per loan category.

Non-Traditional Mortgage Portfolio
Our non-traditional mortgage (NTM) portfolio is comprised of three interest only products: Green Loans, fixed or adjustable rate hybrid interest only rate mortgage (Interest Only) loans and a small number of additional loans with the potential for negative amortization. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the NTM loans totaled $600.7 million, or 10.1% of total loans, and $826.7 million, or 10.7% of total loans, respectively. Total NTM portfolio decreased by $226.1 million, or 27.3%, during the period. The following table presents the composition of the NTM portfolio as of the dates indicated:

The initial credit guidelines for the NTM portfolio were established based on borrower Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score, LTV ratio, property type, occupancy type, loan amount, and geography. Additionally, from an ongoing credit risk management perspective, we have determined the most significant performance indicators for NTMs to be LTV ratios and FICO scores. On a quarterly basis, we perform loan reviews of the NTM loan portfolio, which includes refreshing FICO scores on the Green Loans and HELOCs and ordering third party automated valuation models (AVMs) to confirm collateral values.

Green Loans
We discontinued the origination of Green Loan products in 2011. Green Loans are SFR first and second mortgage
lines of credit with a linked checking account that allows all types of deposits and withdrawals to be performed. The loans are
generally interest only with a 15-year balloon payment due at maturity. We initiated the Green Loan products in
2005 and proactively refined underwriting and credit management practices and credit guidelines in response to changing
economic environments, competitive conditions and portfolio performance. We continue to manage credit risk, to
the extent possible, throughout the borrower’s credit cycle.
At December 31, 2019, Green Loans totaled $52.3 million, a decrease of $17.9 million, or 25.5% from $70.1 million at December 31, 2018, primarily due to reductions in principal balance and payoffs. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $1.5 million and zero of our Green Loans were non-performing. As a result of their unique payment feature, Green Loans possess higher credit risk due to the potential of negative amortization; however, management believes the risk is mitigated through our loan terms and underwriting standards, including our policies on loan-to-value ratios and our contractual ability to curtail loans when the value of underlying collateral declines.

Green Loans are similar to HELOCs in that they are collateralized primarily by the equity in the borrower's home. However, some Green Loans differ from HELOCs relating to certain characteristics including one-action laws. Similar to Green Loans, HELOCs allow the borrower to draw down on the credit line based on an established loan amount for a period of time, typically 10 years, requiring an interest only payment with an option to pay principal at any time. A typical HELOC provides that at the end of the term the borrower can continue to make monthly principal and interest payments based on the loan balance until the maturity date. The Green Loan is an interest only loan with a maturity of 15 years, at which time the loan becomes due and payable with a balloon payment at maturity. The unique payment structure also differs from a traditional HELOC in that payments are made through the direct linkage of a personal checking account to the loan through a nightly sweep of funds into the Green Loan Account. This reduces any outstanding balance on the loan by the total amount deposited into the checking account. As a result, every time a deposit is made, effectively a payment to the Green Loan is made. HELOCs typically do not cause the loan to be paid down by a borrower’s depositing of funds into their checking account at the same bank.

Credit guidelines for Green Loans were established based on borrower FICO scores, property type, occupancy type, loan amount, and geography. Property types include single family residences and second trust deeds where we held the first liens, owner occupied as well as non-owner occupied properties. We utilized our underwriting guidelines for first liens to underwrite the Green Loan secured by second trust deeds as if the combined loans were a single Green Loan. For all Green Loans, the loan income was underwritten using either full income documentation or alternative income documentation.
Interest Only Loans
Interest only loans are primarily SFR mortgage loans with payment features that allow interest only payment in initial periods before converting to a fully amortizing loan. Interest only loans totaled $545.4 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $207.7 million, or 27.6%, from $753.1 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease between periods was primarily due to paydowns and amortization. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $11.5 million and zero of the interest only loans were non-performing.
Loans with the Potential for Negative Amortization
Negative amortization loans totaled $3.0 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $501 thousand, or 14.2%, from $3.5 million as of December 31, 2018. We discontinued origination of negative amortization loans in 2007. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, none of the loans with the potential for negative amortization were non-performing. These loans pose a potentially higher credit risk because of the lack of principal amortization and potential for negative amortization. However, management believes the risk is mitigated through the loan terms and underwriting standards, including our policies on LTV ratios.

Non-Traditional Mortgage Loan Credit Risk Management
We perform detailed reviews of collateral values on loans collateralized by residential real property included in our NTM portfolio based on appraisals or estimates from third party AVMs to analyze property value trends periodically. AVMs are used to identify loans that may have experienced potential collateral deterioration. Once a loan has been identified that may have experienced collateral deterioration, we will obtain updated drive by or full appraisals in order to confirm the valuation. This information is used to update key monitoring metrics such as LTV ratios. Additionally, FICO scores are obtained in conjunction with the collateral analysis. In addition to LTV ratios and FICO scores, we evaluate the portfolio on a specific loan basis through delinquency and portfolio charge-offs to determine whether any risk mitigation or portfolio management actions are warranted. The borrowers may be contacted as necessary to discuss material changes in loan performance or credit metrics.
Our risk management policy and credit monitoring includes reviewing delinquency, FICO scores, and LTV ratios on the NTM loan portfolio. We also continuously monitor market conditions for our geographic lending areas. We have determined that the most significant performance indicators for NTM are LTV ratios and FICO scores. The loan review provides an effective method of identifying borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulty before they fail to make a loan payment. Upon receipt of the updated FICO scores, an exception report is run to identify loans with a decrease in FICO score of 10% or more and a resulting FICO score of 620 or less. The loans are then further analyzed to determine if the risk rating should be downgraded, which may require an increase in the ALL we need to establish for potential losses. A report is prepared and regularly monitored.
We proactively manage the portfolio by performing a detailed analysis with emphasis on the non-traditional mortgage portfolio. We conduct regular meetings to review the loans classified as special mention, substandard, or doubtful and determine whether suspension or reduction in credit limit is warranted. If the line has been suspended and the borrower would like to have their credit privileges reinstated, they would need to provide updated financials showing their ability to meet their payment obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we made no curtailment in available commitments on Green Loans.
On the interest only loans, we project future payment changes to determine if there will be an increase in payment of 3.50% or greater and then monitor the loans for possible delinquencies. The individual loans are monitored for possible downgrading of risk rating, and trends within the portfolio are identified that could affect other interest only loans scheduled for payment changes in the near future.
NTM loans may entail greater risk than do traditional SFR mortgage loans. For additional information regarding NTMs, see "Non-Traditional Mortgage Loans" under Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Traditional loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days totaled $25.4 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.7 million, or 36.1%, from $18.6 million at December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to increases in commercial and industrial, SBA and SFR loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate, multifamily, construction and other consumer loans.
The increase in commercial and industrial loans for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of the addition of one loan with a real estate developer totaling $5.0 million. The increase in single family residential mortgage for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of fluctuations in the timing of borrower payments between periods.

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
Loans that we modify or restructure where the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and make a concession to the borrower in the form of changes in the amortization terms, reductions in the interest rates, the acceptance of interest only payments and, in limited cases, reductions in the outstanding loan balances are classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). TDRs are loans modified for the purpose of alleviating temporary impairments to the borrower’s financial condition. A workout plan between a borrower and us is designed to provide a bridge for the cash flow shortfalls in the near term. If the borrower works through the near-term issues, in most cases, the original contractual terms of the loan will be reinstated.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had 25 and 13 loans with an aggregate balance of $21.8 million and $8.0 million classified as TDRs. When a loan becomes a TDR we cease accruing interest, and classify it as non-accrual until the borrower demonstrates that the loan is again performing.
At December 31, 2019, of the 25 loans classified as TDRs, 14 loans totaling $6.6 million were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms and were in accruing status. At December 31, 2018, of the 13 loans classified as TDRs, 12 loans totaling $5.7 million were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms and were in accruing status.

Risk Ratings
Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve or charge-off is not warranted.
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allocation allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the Board of Directors. General allocation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allocation allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our specific allocation allowances is subject to review by the OCC, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allocation allowances.
In connection with the filing of the Bank’s periodic reports with the OCC and in accordance with policies for the Bank's classification of assets, the Bank regularly reviews the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of management’s review of assets, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had classified assets (including OREO) totaling $102.0 million and $84.5 million. The total amount classified represented 1.30% and 0.79% of our total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Allowance for Loan Losses (ALL)
We maintain an ALL to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The ALL is based on ongoing assessment of the estimated probable losses presently inherent in the loan portfolio. In evaluating the level of the ALL, management considers the types of loans and the amount of loans in the portfolio, peer group information, historical loss experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral, and prevailing economic conditions. This methodology takes into account many factors, including our own historical and peer loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings, loan specific attributes along with a review of various credit metrics and trends. The process involves subjective as well as complex judgments. In addition, we use adjustments for numerous factors including those found in the federal banking agencies' joint Interagency Policy Statement on ALL, which include current economic conditions, loan seasoning, underwriting experience, and collateral value changes among others. We evaluate all impaired loans individually using guidance from ASC 310 primarily through the evaluation of cash flows or collateral values.
At December 31, 2019, our ALL was $57.6 million, or 0.97 percent of total loans, as compared to $62.2 million, or 0.81 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2018. We recorded provision for loan losses of $36.4 million, $30.2 million and $13.7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
The increase in ALL and provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a $35.1 million charge-off of a line of credit originated in November 2017 to a borrower purportedly the subject of a fraudulent scheme. In addition, the charge-off increased the loss factor used in our allowance for loan loss for commercial and industrial loans, resulting in an additional loan loss provision of $3.0 million. On October 22, 2019, in connection with this matter, the Bank filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (Case CV '19 02031 GPC KSC) seeking to recover its losses and other monetary damages against Chicago Title Insurance Company and Chicago Title Company, asserting claims under RICO, 18 U.S.C § 1962 and for RICO Conspiracy, Fraud, Aiding and Abetting Fraud, Negligent Misrepresentation, Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Negligence. We are actively considering and pursuing available sources of recovery and other potential means of mitigating the loss; however, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in that regard. During the third quarter of 2019, we undertook an extensive collateral review of all commercial lending relationships $5 million and above not secured by real estate, consisting of 53 loans representing $536 million in commitments. The collateral review focused on security and collateral documentation and confirmation of the Bank's collateral interest. The review was performed within the Bank's Internal Audit department and the work was validated by an independent third party. Our review and outside validation have not identified any other instances of apparent fraud for the credits reviewed or concerns over the existence of collateral held by the Bank or on our behalf at third parties; however, there are no assurances that our internal review and third party validation will be sufficient to identify all such issues. Excluding this charge-off, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the provision for loan losses and ALL were positively impacted by the $1.75 billion reduction in loan balances, partially offset by an increase in classified loans which increased from $80.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $102.0 million at December 31, 2019. In particular, a $24.9 million commercial and industrial loan was downgraded during the fourth quarter of 2019.
For the comparable 2018 period, $30.2 million of loan loss provisions were recorded, inclusive of a $13.9 million charge-off, which reflected the outstanding balance under a $15.0 million line of credit that was originated during the first quarter of 2018. Subsequent to the granting of the line of credit, representations from the borrower in applying for the line of credit were determined by the Bank to be false, and third party bank account statements provided by the borrower to secure the line of credit were found to be fraudulent. The line of credit was granted after the borrower appeared to have satisfied a pre-condition that the line of credit be fully cash collateralized and secured by a bank account at a third party financial institution pledged to the Bank. As part of the Bank’s credit review and portfolio management process, the line of credit and disbursements were reviewed subsequent to closing and compliance with the borrower’s covenants was monitored. As part of this process, on March 9, 2018, the Bank received information that caused it to believe the existence of the pledged bank account had been misrepresented by the borrower and that the account had previously been closed. The Bank filed an action in federal court pursuing the borrower and other parties and is also pursuing other available sources of collection and other potential means of mitigating the loss; however, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in this regard.

Servicing Rights
We retain servicing rights from certain sales of SFR mortgage loans and SBA loans.
Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). MSRs are accounted for at fair value and totaled $1.2 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The aggregate principal balance of the loans underlying MSRs was $150.6 million and $204.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The recorded amount of MSRs as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the loans we are servicing were 0.77% and 0.87% at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
During the first half of 2018, we sold $28.5 million of MSRs on approximately $3.55 billion in unpaid principal
balances of conventional agency mortgage loans for cash consideration of $30.1 million, subject to prepayment protection
provision and standard representations and warranties. The sale of MSRs resulted in a net loss of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to transaction costs, provision for early repayments of loans, and expected repurchase obligations under standard representations and warranties.
We sold $37.8 million of MSRs as a part of discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2017.
SBA servicing rights. SBA servicing rights are accounted for at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $1.1 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The aggregate principal balance of the loans underlying SBA servicing rights was $75.2 million and $96.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The recorded amount of SBA servicing rights as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the loans we are servicing were 1.52% and 1.72% at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
For additional information, see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Goodwill and other intangible assets
We had goodwill of $37.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we wrote off goodwill of $2.1 million.
We conduct our evaluation of goodwill impairment as of August 31 each year, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2019 and determined that no goodwill impairment existed.
We had core deposit intangibles of $4.2 million and $6.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Core deposit intangibles are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 4 to 10 years. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted-average remaining amortization period for core deposit intangibles was approximately 4.7 years.
We recorded impairment on intangible assets of zero, zero, and $336 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also wrote off a client relationship intangible of $246 thousand and a trade name intangible of $90 thousand.

Alternative Energy Partnerships

Unfunded equity commitments $ 3,225 $ —

Our investments in alternative energy partnerships are primarily returned through the realization of energy tax credits and other tax benefits rather than through distributions or through the sale of the investment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the recognition of tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships was $3.4 million, partially offset by tax expense from tax basis reduction of $362 thousand, compared to $9.6 million of tax credits recognized, partially offset by tax expense

Table of Contents

from tax basis reduction of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The reduction in tax credits received by us is due to fewer investments in alternative energy partnerships. The HLBV loss for the period is largely driven by accelerated tax depreciation on equipment and the recognition of energy tax credits which reduces the amount distributable by the investee in a hypothetical liquidation under the contractual liquidation provisions.
For additional information, see Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Deposits
Total deposits were $5.43 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.49 billion, or 31.4%, from $7.92 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to controlled run-off of higher costing deposits, including matured certificates of deposit that were not renewed and other non-maturity accounts. During 2019, we continued efforts to build core deposits across our business units, including strong growth from the community banking and private banking channel, as well as reductions in brokered deposits. Brokered deposits were $10.0 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.70 billion, or 99.4%, from $1.71 billion at December 31, 2018. Brokered deposits represented 0.2% and 21.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2019 and 2018. During 2019, noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $65.2 million to $1.09 billion, or 20.1% of total deposits, at December 31, 2019.

Borrowings
Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we may utilize borrowings when they are a less costly source of funds and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, when we desire additional capacity to fund loan demand, or when they meet our asset/liability management goals to diversify funding sources and enhance the interest rate risk management.
We utilize FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements to leverage our capital base, to provide funds for our lending activities, to provide a source of liquidity, and to enhance our interest rate risk management. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as through unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks. We may obtain advances from the FHLB by collateralizing the advances with certain of our loans and investment securities. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features.
FHLB advances totaled $1.20 billion and $1.52 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 2019, $730.0 million of the Bank's advances from FHLB were fixed rate and had interest rates ranging from 1.82% to 3.32% with a weighted-average interest rate of 2.66%, and $465.0 million of the Bank's advances from FHLB were variable rate and had a weighted-average interest rate of 1.66%. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank’s advances from the FHLB were collateralized by certain real estate loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $3.05 billion and $4.05 billion. The Bank’s investment in

capital stock of the FHLB of San Francisco totaled $32.3 million and $41.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Based on this collateral, the Bank was eligible to borrow an additional $1.02 billion at December 31, 2019.
We did not have any outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2019 or 2018.

Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments
We maintain a reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that is considered adequate to cover the estimated and known inherent risks. The probability of usage of the unfunded loan commitments and credit risk factors are determined based on outstanding loans that share similar credit risk exposure. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments was $4.1 million and $4.6 million and included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the reserve for unfunded commitments are recorded in other noninterest expense in the accompany Consolidated Statements of Operations. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2019 was mainly due to a reduction in the amount of unfunded loan commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
The following table presents a summary of activity in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments for the periods indicated:

Balance at end of period $ 4,064 $ 4,622 $ 3,716

Reserve for Loss on Repurchased Loans
When we sell residential mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market, we make customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about various characteristics of each loan, such as the manner of origination, the nature and extent of underwriting standards applied and the types of documentation being provided. Typically, these representations and warranties are in place for the life of the loan. If a defect in the origination process is identified, we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. If there are no such defects, generally we have no liability to the purchaser for losses it may incur on such loan. In addition, we had the option to buy out severely delinquent loans at par from GNMA pools for which we were the servicer and issuer of the pool. We maintain a reserve for losses on repurchased loans to account for the expected losses related to loans we might be required to repurchase (or the indemnity payments we may have to make to purchasers). The reserve takes into account both the estimate of expected losses on loans sold during the current accounting period, as well as adjustments to the previous estimates of expected losses on loans sold. In each case, these estimates are based on the most recent data available, including data from third parties, regarding demand for loan repurchases, actual loan repurchases, and actual credit losses on repurchased loans, among other factors.
Reserve for loss on repurchased loans totaled $6.2 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.7 million, or 147.4%, from $2.5 million at December 31, 2018. Approximately $4.6 million of the change was due to the establishment of new reserves, including $4.4 million associated with our multifamily securitization during the year ended December 31, 2019. Offsetting the increase was a $868 thousand decrease due to portfolio run-off and repurchase settlement activities.
Provisions added to the reserve for loss on repurchased loans are initially recorded against noninterest income at the time of sale, and any subsequent increase or decrease in the provision is then recorded under noninterest expense on the Consolidated

67

Table of Contents

Statements of Operations as an increase or decrease to provision for loan repurchases. Initial provisions for loan repurchases were $4.6 million, $126 thousand and $1.6 million, respectively, and subsequent reversals in the provision were $(660) thousand, $(2.5) million and $(1.8) million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
We believe that all repurchase demands received were adequately reserved for at December 31, 2019. For additional information, see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Liquidity Management
We are required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Historically, we have maintained liquid assets above levels believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows, and dividend payments. Cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.
Banc of California, N.A.
The Bank's liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents and securities available-for-sale, is a product of its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Bank's primary sources of funds are deposits; payments (including interest and principal) on outstanding loans and investment securities; sales of loans, investment securities and other short-term investments; and funds provided from operations. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and investment securities, and maturing investment securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. In addition, the Bank invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. The Bank also generates cash through borrowings. The Bank mainly utilizes FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements to leverage its capital base, to provide funds for its lending activities, as a source of liquidity, and to enhance its interest rate risk management. The Bank also has the ability to obtain brokered deposits and collect deposits through its wholesale and treasury operations. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Any excess liquidity is typically invested in federal funds or investment securities. On a longer-term basis, the Bank maintains a strategy of investing in various lending products. The Bank uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing loan and other commitments, and to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals.

The primary sources of funds for Banc of California, Inc., on a stand-alone holding company basis, are dividends and intercompany tax payments from the Bank, outside borrowing, and its ability to raise capital and issue debt securities. Dividends from the Bank are largely dependent upon the Bank's earnings and are subject to restrictions under certain regulations that limit its ability to transfer funds to the holding company. OCC regulations impose various restrictions on the ability of a bank to make capital distributions, which include dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, and certain other items. Generally, a well-capitalized bank may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to up to 100% of year-to-date net income plus retained net income for the two preceding years without prior OCC approval. However, any dividend paid by the Bank would be limited by the need to maintain its well capitalized status plus the capital buffer in order to avoid additional dividend restrictions (Refer to Capital - Dividend Restrictions below for additional information). Currently, the Bank does not have sufficient dividend-paying capacity to declare and pay such dividends to the holding company without obtaining prior approval from the OCC under the applicable regulations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Bank paid dividends of $142.5 million to Banc of California, Inc. At December 31, 2019, Banc of California, Inc. had $74.0 million in cash, all of which was on deposit at the Bank. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed a partial tender offer for depositary shares representing shares of our Series D and Series E preferred stock. The total consideration for each Series E Depositary Share tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the offer equaled $27.13. The total consideration for each Series D Depositary Share tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the offer equaled $26.39. The aggregate total consideration paid by us for the preferred stock accepted for purchase was $46.0 million inclusive of premium to par and accrued dividends ($19.4 million of series D and $26.6 million series E depository shares). The completed partial tender offer resulted in a $5.1 million reduction to net income available to common shareholders.
On a consolidated basis, we maintained $373.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, which was 4.8% of total assets at December 31, 2019. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $18.1 million, or 4.6%, from $391.6 million, or 3.7% of total assets, at December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to reductions in deposits and FHLB advances, offset by cash received from sales of investment securities and loans. We have benefited from completion during late 2018 of our exit from high-rate and high-volatility institutional deposits and reduced the reliance on brokered deposits by replacing them with core deposits to fund new loan originations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we also strategically decreased our securities portfolio to navigate a volatile rate environment by completing the sale of our entire commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolio and reducing our collateralized loan obligations and mortgage-back securities exposure by selling $1.20 billion of these investments. All of these strategic actions were taken in order to expand core lending activities across the organization

and reduce our reliance on higher costing brokered certificates of deposit, while attempting to reduce risk on our consolidated balance sheet.
At December 31, 2019, we had available unused secured borrowing capacities of $1.02 billion from FHLB and $16.7 million from Federal Reserve Discount Window, as well as $185.0 million from unused unsecured federal funds lines of credit. We also maintained repurchase agreements and had no outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements at December 31, 2019. Availabilities and terms on repurchase agreements are subject to the counterparties' discretion and pledging additional investment securities. We also had unpledged securities available-for-sale of $868.5 million at December 31, 2019.
We believe that our liquidity sources are stable and are adequate to meet our day-to-day cash flow requirements. As of December 31, 2019, we believe that there are no events, uncertainties, material commitments, or capital expenditures that were reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position.

Commitments
The following table presents information as of December 31, 2019 regarding our commitments and contractual obligations:

During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Bank entered into certain definitive agreements which grant the Bank the exclusive naming rights to the Banc of California Stadium, a soccer stadium of The Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) as well as the right to be the official bank of LAFC. In exchange for the Bank’s rights as set forth in the agreements, the Bank agreed to pay LAFC $100.0 million over a period of 15 years, beginning in 2017 and ending in 2032. The advertising benefits of such rights are amortized on a straight-line basis and recorded as advertising and promotion expense beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank has paid $20.8 million of the $100.0 million commitment. The prepaid commitment balance, net of amortization, was $7.4 million as of December 31, 2019, which was recognized as a prepaid asset and included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
We had unfunded commitments of $22.4 million, $7.6 million, and $501 thousand for Affordable Housing Fund Investment, SBIC, and Other Investments at December 31, 2019.

Stockholders’ Equity
Stockholders’ equity totaled $907.2 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $38.3 million, or 4.0%, from $945.5 million at December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily the result of the partial redemption of our Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock for an aggregate amount of $46.0 million, cash dividends for common stock of $15.7 million and cash dividends for preferred stock of $15.6 million, partially offset by net income of $23.8 million and $12.2 million of other comprehensive income on securities available-for-sale due primarily to decreases in market interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2019. For additional information, see Note 19 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In order to maintain adequate levels of capital, we continuously assess projected sources and uses of capital to support projected asset growth, operating needs and credit risk. We consider, among other things, earnings generated from operations and access to capital from financial markets. In addition, we perform capital stress tests on an annual basis to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy on our capital base.

Regulatory Capital
The Company and the Bank are subject to the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines that are established by the Federal banking regulators. In July 2013, the Federal banking regulators approved a rule to implement the revised capital adequacy standards of the Basel III and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule strengthened the definition of regulatory capital, increased risk-based capital requirements, made selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets, and adjusts the prompt corrective action thresholds. The Company and the Bank became subject to the new rule on January 1, 2015 and certain provisions of the new rule were phased in through January 1, 2019. Inclusive of the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer, the common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratio minimums are 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. For additional information on Basel III capital rules, see Note 20 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table presents the regulatory capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as of dates indicated:

The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 22.2%. This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income,...

['s Internal Audit department and the work was validated by an independent third party. Our review and outside validation have not identified any other instances of apparent fraud for the credits reviewed or concerns over the existence of collateral held by the Bank or on our behalf at third parties; however, there are no assurances that our internal review and third party validation will be sufficient to identify all such issues. Excluding this charge-off, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the provision for loan losses and ALL were positively impacted by the $1.75 billion reduction in loan balances, partially offset by an increase in classified loans which increased from $80.8 million at December 31, 2018 to $102.0 million at December 31, 2019. In particular, a $24.9 million commercial and industrial loan was downgraded during the fourth quarter of 2019.
For the comparable 2018 period, $30.2 million of loan loss provisions were recorded, inclusive of a $13.9 million charge-off, which reflected the outstanding balance under a $15.0 million line of credit that was originated during the first quarter of 2018. Subsequent to the granting of the line of credit, representations from the borrower in applying for the line of credit were determined by the Bank to be false, and third party bank account statements provided by the borrower to secure the line of credit were found to be fraudulent. The line of credit was granted after the borrower appeared to have satisfied a pre-condition that the line of credit be fully cash collateralized and secured by a bank account at a third party financial institution pledged to the Bank. As part of the Bank’s credit review and portfolio management process, the line of credit and disbursements were reviewed subsequent to closing and compliance with the borrower’s covenants was monitored. As part of this process, on March 9, 2018, the Bank received information that caused it to believe the existence of the pledged bank account had been misrepresented by the borrower and that the account had previously been closed. The Bank filed an action in federal court pursuing the borrower and other parties and is also pursuing other available sources of collection and other potential means of mitigating the loss; however, no assurance can be given that it will be successful in this regard.

Servicing Rights
We retain servicing rights from certain sales of SFR mortgage loans and SBA loans.
Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). MSRs are accounted for at fair value and totaled $1.2 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The aggregate principal balance of the loans underlying MSRs was $150.6 million and $204.0 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The recorded amount of MSRs as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the loans we are servicing were 0.77% and 0.87% at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
During the first half of 2018, we sold $28.5 million of MSRs on approximately $3.55 billion in unpaid principal
balances of conventional agency mortgage loans for cash consideration of $30.1 million, subject to prepayment protection
provision and standard representations and warranties. The sale of MSRs resulted in a net loss of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to transaction costs, provision for early repayments of loans, and expected repurchase obligations under standard representations and warranties.
We sold $37.8 million of MSRs as a part of discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2017.
SBA servicing rights. SBA servicing rights are accounted for at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $1.1 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The aggregate principal balance of the loans underlying SBA servicing rights was $75.2 million and $96.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The recorded amount of SBA servicing rights as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the loans we are servicing were 1.52% and 1.72% at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
For additional information, see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Goodwill and other intangible assets
We had goodwill of $37.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we wrote off goodwill of $2.1 million.
We conduct our evaluation of goodwill impairment as of August 31 each year, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2019 and determined that no goodwill impairment existed.
We had core deposit intangibles of $4.2 million and $6.3 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Core deposit intangibles are amortized over their useful lives ranging from 4 to 10 years. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted-average remaining amortization period for core deposit intangibles was approximately 4.7 years.
We recorded impairment on intangible assets of zero, zero, and $336 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also wrote off a client relationship intangible of $246 thousand and a trade name intangible of $90 thousand.
For additional information, see Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Alternative Energy Partnerships
The following table presents the activity related to our investment in alternative energy partnerships for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:

Loss on investments using HLBV method (1,694 ) (5,044 )
Balance at end of period $ 29,300 $ 28,988
Unfunded equity commitments $ 3,225 $ —

Our investments in alternative energy partnerships are primarily returned through the realization of energy tax credits and other tax benefits rather than through distributions or through the sale of the investment. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the recognition of tax credits on investments in alternative energy partnerships was $3.4 million, partially offset by tax expense from tax basis reduction of $362 thousand, compared to $9.6 million of tax credits recognized, partially offset by tax expense

Table of Contents

from tax basis reduction of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The reduction in tax credits received by us is due to fewer investments in alternative energy partnerships. The HLBV loss for the period is largely driven by accelerated tax depreciation on equipment and the recognition of energy tax credits which reduces the amount distributable by the investee in a hypothetical liquidation under the contractual liquidation provisions.
For additional information, see Note 21 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Deposits
Total deposits were $5.43 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $2.49 billion, or 31.4%, from $7.92 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was mainly due to controlled run-off of higher costing deposits, including matured certificates of deposit that were not renewed and other non-maturity accounts. During 2019, we continued efforts to build core deposits across our business units, including strong growth from the community banking and private banking channel, as well as reductions in brokered deposits. Brokered deposits were $10.0 million at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.70 billion, or 99.4%, from $1.71 billion at December 31, 2018. Brokered deposits represented 0.2% and 21.6% of total deposits at December 31, 2019 and 2018. During 2019, noninterest-bearing deposits increased by $65.2 million to $1.09 billion, or 20.1% of total deposits, at December 31, 2019.

Borrowings
Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we may utilize borrowings when they are a less costly source of funds and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, when we desire additional capacity to fund loan demand, or when they meet our asset/liability management goals to diversify funding sources and enhance the interest rate risk management.
We utilize FHLB advances and securities sold under repurchase agreements to leverage our capital base, to provide funds for our lending activities, to provide a source of liquidity, and to enhance our interest rate risk management. We also have the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as through unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks. We may obtain advances from the FHLB by collateralizing the advances with certain of our loans and investment securities. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features.
FHLB advances totaled $1.20 billion and $1.52 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 2019, $730.0 million of the Bank']:

Reserve for Unfunded Loan Commitments
We maintain a reserve for unfunded loan commitments at a level that is considered adequate to cover the estimated and known inherent risks. The probability of usage of the unfunded loan commitments and credit risk factors are determined based on outstanding loans that share similar credit risk exposure. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the reserve for unfunded loan commitments was $4.1 million and $4.6 million and included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the reserve for unfunded commitments are recorded in other noninterest expense in the accompany Consolidated Statements of Operations. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2019 was mainly due to a reduction in the amount of unfunded loan commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2019.

Reserve for Loss on Repurchased Loans
When we sell residential mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market, we make customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about various characteristics of each loan, such as the manner of origination, the nature and extent of underwriting standards applied and the types of documentation being provided. Typically, these representations and warranties are in place for the life of the loan. If a defect in the origination process is identified, we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the purchaser for losses it sustains on the loan. If there are no such defects, generally we have no liability to the purchaser for losses it may incur on such loan. In addition, we had the option to buy out severely delinquent loans at par from GNMA pools for which we were the servicer and issuer of the pool. We maintain a reserve for losses on repurchased loans to account for the expected losses related to loans we might be required to repurchase (or the indemnity payments we may have to make to purchasers). The reserve takes into account both the estimate of expected losses on loans sold during the current accounting period, as well as adjustments to the previous estimates of expected losses on loans sold. In each case, these estimates are based on the most recent data available, including data from third parties, regarding demand for loan repurchases, actual loan repurchases, and actual credit losses on repurchased loans, among other factors.
Reserve for loss on repurchased loans totaled $6.2 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.7 million, or 147.4%, from $2.5 million at December 31, 2018. Approximately $4.6 million of the change was due to the establishment of new reserves, including $4.4 million associated with our multifamily securitization during the year ended December 31, 2019. Offsetting the increase was a $868 thousand decrease due to portfolio run-off and repurchase settlement activities.
Provisions added to the reserve for loss on repurchased loans are initially recorded against noninterest income at the time of sale, and any subsequent increase or decrease in the provision is then recorded under noninterest expense on the Consolidated

Statements of Operations as an increase or decrease to provision for loan repurchases. Initial provisions for loan repurchases were $4.6 million, $126 thousand and $1.6 million, respectively, and subsequent reversals in the provision were $(660) thousand, $(2.5) million and $(1.8) million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
We believe that all repurchase demands received were adequately reserved for at December 31, 2019. For additional information, see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements included Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Liquidity Management
We are required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. Historically, we have maintained liquid assets above levels believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows, and dividend payments. Cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Operations Founded in 1982, Adobe Inc. is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, students, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, independent software vendors, retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). Basis of Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and...

[" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments and accounting estimates that affect the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses on the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes, and amounts disclosed as contingent assets and liabilities. While we base estimates on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed to be relevant, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures that are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgment and are reflective of significant uncertainties, and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management has identified our most critical accounting policies and accounting estimates as: investment securities, allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes. See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a description of these policies.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information on recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements.
The following recently issued accounting pronouncement is of material importance to us: In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (ASU 2016-13) which is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. To achieve this objective, the amendments in this guidance replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current US GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to credit loss estimates. This ASU will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.
We have developed our models to estimate lifetime expected credit losses on our loans primarily using a lifetime loss methodology. We have used these models to execute our process for estimating the allowance for credit losses under the new standard in parallel with our existing process for estimating the allowance for credit losses based on incurred losses and have developed an appropriate governance process for our estimate of expected credit losses under the new standard. The adoption of this standard will be applied through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. We expect our allowance for credit losses may increase by approximately 5% to 15% from our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2019.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us, such as reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and adopting a territorial tax system. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 22.2%. This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income,...

Traditional loans that were past due at least 30 days but less than 90 days totaled $25.4 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.7 million, or 36.1%, from $18.6 million at December 31, 2018. The increase was mainly due to increases in commercial and industrial, SBA and SFR loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate, multifamily, construction and other consumer loans.
The increase in commercial and industrial loans for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of the addition of one loan with a real estate developer totaling $5.0 million. The increase in single family residential mortgage for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was a result of fluctuations in the timing of borrower payments between periods.

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans
Loans that we modify or restructure where the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and make a concession to the borrower in the form of changes in the amortization terms, reductions in the interest rates, the acceptance of interest only payments and, in limited cases, reductions in the outstanding loan balances are classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). TDRs are loans modified for the purpose of alleviating temporary impairments to the borrower’s financial condition. A workout plan between a borrower and us is designed to provide a bridge for the cash flow shortfalls in the near term. If the borrower works through the near-term issues, in most cases, the original contractual terms of the loan will be reinstated.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had 25 and 13 loans with an aggregate balance of $21.8 million and $8.0 million classified as TDRs. When a loan becomes a TDR we cease accruing interest, and classify it as non-accrual until the borrower demonstrates that the loan is again performing.
At December 31, 2019, of the 25 loans classified as TDRs, 14 loans totaling $6.6 million were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms and were in accruing status. At December 31, 2018, of the 13 loans classified as TDRs, 12 loans totaling $5.7 million were making payments according to their modified terms and were less than 90-days delinquent under the modified terms and were in accruing status.

Risk Ratings
Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve or charge-off is not warranted.
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allocation allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the Board of Directors. General allocation allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss, it is required either to establish a specific allocation allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our specific allocation allowances is subject to review by the OCC, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allocation allowances.
