Management’s Overview of 2019 Financial Performance
Overall, we had strong growth and profitability to cap a record year in 2019, which was marked by higher net interest and core fee income, record investment securities and equity warrant gains, strong total client funds growth, healthy loan growth and continued stable credit quality. Additionally, we saw higher noninterest expense, primarily from increased compensation and benefits expenses, as well as increased professional services expenses reflective of increased expenses to support our domestic and global expansion initiatives, as well as investments made in projects, systems, and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives and other operating costs. Increases in noninterest income and noninterest expenses were attributable to, in part, the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our 2019 financial results.
Our core business continued to perform well as a result of our ongoing focus on innovation companies and their investors and continued efforts to secure client relationships. We saw continued success in working with private equity/venture capital firms and life science/healthcare clients as well as clients in our private banking division.
Results for the fiscal year ended, and as of, December 31, 2019 (compared to the fiscal year ended, and as of, December 31, 2018, where applicable):

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations. We have identified three policies as being critical because they require us to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Our critical accounting policies include those that address the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and allowance for unfunded credit commitments, measurements of fair value and the valuation of equity warrant assets. Our senior management has discussed and reviewed the development, selection, application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.
We disclose our method and approach for each of our critical accounting policies in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments
Allowance for Loan Losses
The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. We consider our accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses to be critical as our estimation of the allowance involves material estimates by us and is particularly susceptible to significant changes in the near-term. Determining the allowance for loan losses requires us to make forecasts that are highly uncertain and require a high degree of judgment. Our loan loss reserve methodology is applied to our loan portfolio and we maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels that we believe are appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. A committee comprised of senior management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.
Our allowance for loan losses is established for loan losses that are probable and incurred but not yet realized. The process of anticipating loan losses is inherently imprecise. We apply a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. At the time of approval, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating through an evaluation process, which includes consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values, potential loan concentrations and general economic conditions. The credit risk ratings for each loan are monitored and updated on an ongoing basis.
The allowance for loan losses is based on a formula allocation for similarly risk-rated loans by client industry sector and individually for impaired loans. Our formula allocation is determined on a quarterly basis by utilizing a historical loan loss migration model, which is a statistical model used to estimate an appropriate allowance for outstanding loan balances by calculating the likelihood of a loan being charged-off based on its credit risk rating using historical loan performance data from our portfolio. The formula allocation provides the average loan loss experience for each portfolio segment, which considers our quarterly historical loss experience since the year 2000, both by risk-rating category and client industry sector. The resulting loan loss factors for each risk-rating category and client industry sector are ultimately applied to the respective period-end client loan balances for each corresponding risk-rating category by client industry sector to provide an estimation of the allowance for loan losses.
We also supplement our allowance by applying qualitative allocations to the results we obtained through our historical loan loss migration model to ascertain the total allowance for loan losses. These qualitative allocations are based upon management's assessment of the risks that may lead to a loan loss experience different from our historical loan loss experience. These risks are aggregated to become our qualitative allocation. Refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a summary of the factors management considers for its qualitative allocation as part of management's estimate of the changing risks in the lending environment.

Table of Contents

Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments
The allowance for unfunded credit commitments is determined using a methodology that is inherently similar to the methodology used for calculating the allowance for loan losses adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at funding. Our reserve methodology for unfunded loan commitments applies segment specific historical loss experience for our funded loan portfolio and segment specific probability of funding factors to estimate the allowance for unfunded credit commitments. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments also includes certain qualitative allocations as deemed appropriate by management. We consider our accounting policy for the allowance for unfunded credit commitments to be critical as estimation of the reserve involves material estimates by management and is susceptible to changes in the near term. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments equals management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
For an overview of the impact of CECL to the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, see “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” under Part II, Item 7 of this report.
Fair Value Measurements
We use fair value measurements to record fair value for certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures. We disclose our method and approach for fair value measurements of assets and liabilities in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable and the significance of the level of the input to the entire measurement. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data. The three levels for measuring fair value are defined in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value (Level 1 measurements). When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. For inactive markets, there is little information, if any, to evaluate if individual transactions are orderly. Accordingly, we are required to estimate, based upon all available facts and circumstances, the degree to which orderly transactions are occurring and provide more weighting to price quotes that are based upon orderly transactions (Level 2 measurements). In addition, changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. For example, reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable. Therefore, when market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement (Level 3 measurements). Significant judgment is required to determine whether certain assets measured at fair value are included in Level 2 or Level 3. When making this judgment, we consider available information and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. The classification of Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the Level 3 inputs to the instrument's fair value measurement in its entirety. If Level 3 inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greater for financial assets and liabilities categorized as Level 3.
The following table summarizes our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the amounts measured using significant Level 3 inputs at December 31, 2019 and 2018:

----------------------------------------------- ------------- ---------- ------- --- ------------- ------- ------- - --- --------- - - -------

(Dollars in thousands) Total Balance Level 3 Total Balance Level 3

Table of Contents

Financial assets valued using Level 3 measurements consist of our non-marketable securities (investments in venture capital) and equity warrant assets (rights to shares of private and public company capital stock). The valuation techniques of our non-marketable securities carried under fair value accounting and equity warrant assets involve a significant degree of management judgment. Refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a summary of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used for each class of Level 3 assets.
The inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying companies, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the underlying companies, general volatility and interest rate market factors, and legal and contractual restrictions. The timing and amount of actual net proceeds, if any, from the disposition of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including investor demand for IPOs, levels of M&A activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell and the perceived and actual performance of portfolio companies. All of these factors are difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will realize the full value of these securities, which could result in significant losses.
During 2019, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $133.9 million (which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), primarily due to gains on exercised warrant assets. During 2018 and 2017, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $88.4 million and $55.2 million (which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), respectively.
Derivative Assets-Equity Warrant Assets
As discussed above, the valuation of our equity warrant assets is a Level 3 measurement, which requires a significant degree of management judgment in order to value the assets. Our equity warrant asset policy is also considered a critical policy due to the variability of returns from our shares of private and public companies and due to the degree of management judgment in selecting a valuation technique for our equity warrant assets.
The timing and value realized from the disposition of equity warrant assets depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for IPOs, fluctuations in the price of the underlying common stock of these private and public companies, levels of M&A activity and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. All of these factors are difficult to predict. Many equity warrant assets may be terminated or may expire without compensation and may incur valuation losses from lower-priced funding rounds. We are unable to predict future gains or losses with accuracy, and gains or losses could vary materially from period to period.
Additionally, while management has selected the valuation methodology that it believes provides the best estimate of fair value, there are several acceptable valuation techniques as well as alternative approaches for the calculation of significant inputs for the valuation technique. In the event that a different valuation technique or approach for calculating a significant input were to be used, then the estimated values of these assets could differ significantly from the existing values recorded. Further, the inherent uncertainty of valuing assets for which a ready market is unavailable may cause our estimated values of these assets to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the assets existed, and those differences could be material and ultimately, the recorded fair value of equity warrant assets may never be realized, which could result in significant losses.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
In June 2016, the FASB issued a new Accounting Standard Update (ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments- Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments) ("ASU 2016-13" or "CECL"), which amends the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects a current expected credit loss measurement to estimate the allowance for credit losses over the contractual life of the financial assets (including loans, unfunded credit commitments and HTM debt securities) and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. While the CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale debt securities, ASU 2016-13 does require entities to record an allowance when recognizing credit losses for available-for-sale securities, rather than reduce the amortized cost of the securities by direct write-offs, which allows for reversal of credit impairments in future periods based on improvements in credit. We adopted the guidance on January 1, 2020, using a modified retrospective approach.
Our implementation process included loss forecasting model development, evaluation of technical accounting topics, updates to our allowance accounting policies, reporting processes and related internal controls, overall operational readiness

for our adoption of CECL as well as parallel runs for CECL alongside our current allowance process. We provided quarterly updates to senior management and to the Audit and Credit Committees of the Board of Directors throughout the implementation process.
A summary of our approach for estimating current expected life-time credit losses for loans, unfunded commitments and HTM debt securities includes the following:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years for all portfolio segments and classes of financing receivables and unfunded credit exposures leveraging the weighted-average of a range of macroeconomic scenarios. This period reflects management’s expectation of losses based on forward-looking economic scenarios over that time and closely aligns with other internal forecast periods. After the forecast period, our estimate of credit losses will revert to historical averages gradually over the remaining contractual lives, adjusted for prepayments. The macroeconomic scenarios are reviewed on a quarterly basis.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We will utilize a discounted cash flow ("DCF") approach to measure credit impairment for loans identified for individual assessment, which includes TDR's. Collateral-dependent loans identified for individual assessment will be carried at the fair value of collateral, net of selling costs (when applicable).

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our HTM debt securities portfolio, with the exception of our municipal bond portfolio, have been evaluated and currently carry zero risk of credit loss as they are securities that are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. A reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year will be applied to our municipal bonds, however, we do not expect the allowance for credit losses to be significant for this portion of our HTM debt securities portfolio.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Under the prior guidance, our loan portfolio was disclosed by market segments. Going forward, our technology (software/internet and hardware) and life science/healthcare market segments will be disclosed by class of financing receivable that align with their underlying underwriting methodology. The technology (software/internet and hardware) and life science/healthcare market segments will be classified as investor dependent, balance sheet dependent or cash flow dependent and prior period amounts will be reclassified for comparability. There are no other material changes to our current market segments.

Based on our loan and unfunded credit commitments portfolio composition at December 31, 2019, and the current economic environment, we currently estimate the day 1 combined impact of adopting CECL on our allowance for loan losses and allowance for unfunded credit commitments to be an increase of approximately $50 million (on a pre-tax basis) or approximately 13% of the total combined allowance compared to our reported amount at December 31, 2019. The increase reflects an increase in our expected credit loss for our investor dependent loan portfolio as longer-duration assets require more reserves under CECL methodology, offset by a decrease for our private equity/venture capital loan portfolio, given their higher historical credit quality. Based on the credit quality of our existing HTM debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2019, we currently estimate the day one impact of CECL on our allowance for our HTM municipal bond portfolio to be approximately $0.2 million (on a pre-tax basis).
At adoption, we will have a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for our change in the allowance for credit losses for our loans, unfunded credit commitments and HTM debt securities, which will impact our capital. An increase in our allowance will result in a decrease to our regulatory capital amounts and ratios. Federal banking regulatory agencies have provided relief for an initial capital decrease at adoption by allowing the impact to be phased-in over three years on a straight-line basis. At adoption, we do not expect to elect this option as the decrease to our regulatory capital amounts does not have a material impact on our capital ratios.
Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the FASB issued a new Accounting Standard Update (ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement). The ASU primarily modifies certain disclosures with respect to Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance became effective on January 1, 2020. We adopted the guidance on January 1, 2020, however, the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the disclosures in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which is part of the Board’s initiative to reduce cost and complexity related to accounting for income taxes.  The ASU eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, Income Taxes, and simplifies income tax accounting in several areas.  The amendments are effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The ASU allows entities to adopt this provision on a retrospective basis for all periods presented or a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures.

Net Interest Income and Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income is defined as the difference between: (i) interest earned from loans, fixed income investments in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios and short-term investment securities, and, (ii) interest paid on funding sources. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable loans and securities and tax-exempt securities based on the applicable federal statutory tax rate.
Analysis of Net Interest Income Changes Due to Volume and Rate (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume change.” Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “rate change.” The following table sets forth changes in interest income for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and rate changes for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

Net Interest Income (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
2019 compared to 2018
Net interest income increased by $205.4 million to $2.1 billion in 2019, compared to $1.9 billion in 2018. Overall, the increase in our net interest income was due primarily to higher average loan and interest earning cash and short-term investment securities balances.
 The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2019, compared to 2018, are discussed below:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest income for 2019 increased by $342.2 million primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $240.7 million increase in interest income from loans to $1.6 billion in 2019, compared to $1.4 billion in 2018. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $4.3 billion and an increase in the overall yield on our loan portfolio of 5 basis points to 5.35 percent from 5.30 percent. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, increased by 2 basis points to 4.79 percent from 4.77 percent, reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases in effect the first half of the year, partially offset by the strong growth of our lower yielding private equity/venture capital loan portfolio and interest rate decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Our private equity/venture capital portfolio represented 53.5 percent and 49.5 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $61.2 million increase in interest income from our short-term investment securities to $96.4 million, compared to $35.2 million in 2018. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $3.1 billion in average interest earning cash and short-term investment securities balances and higher yields reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases in effect the first half of the year, partially offset by interest rate decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019, and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $40.3 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to $625.8 million in 2019, compared to $585.4 million in 2018. The increase was reflective of an increase in our fixed income securities yield of 22 basis points to 2.58 percent from 2.36 percent, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 billion in average fixed income investment balances primarily due to a decrease in average HTM securities. The increase

Table of Contents

in our fixed income securities yield was primarily from higher reinvestment yields on maturing fixed income investments as well as higher yields on new purchases due to the benefit of interest rate increases in effect the first half of the year.
Interest expense for 2019 increased to $212.8 million, compared to $75.9 million for 2018, primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $148.4 million increase in deposits interest expense, due primarily to an increase in interest paid on our interest-bearing money market deposits as a result of market rate adjustments and an increase of $7.8 billion in average interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An $11.5 million decrease in borrowings interest expense, due primarily to a decrease in our average short-term borrowings balance during 2019 as a result of the increase in average deposit balances.

2018 compared to 2017
Net interest income increased by $479.7 million to $1.9 billion in 2018, compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. Overall, the increase in our net interest income was due primarily to both higher average loan and investment portfolio balances as well as higher interest rates.
The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2018, compared to 2017, are discussed below:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest income for 2018 increased by $510.9 million primarily due to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $332.7 million increase in interest income from loans to $1.4 billion in 2018, compared to $1.0 billion in 2017. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $4.5 billion and an increase in the overall yield on our loan portfolio of 45 basis points to 5.30 percent from 4.85 percent. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, increased by 55 basis points to 4.77 percent from 4.22 percent, reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases, partially offset by the strong growth of our lower yielding private equity/ venture capital loan portfolio. Our private equity/venture capital portfolio represented 49.5 percent and 42.8 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $164.5 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to $585.4 million in 2018, compared to $420.9 million in 2017. The increase was reflective of an increase of $2.4 billion in average fixed income investment balances as a result of strong deposit growth in 2018 and an increase in our fixed income securities yield of 48 basis points to 2.36 percent from 1.88 percent. The increase in our fixed income securities yield was primarily from higher reinvestment yields on maturing fixed income investments as well as higher yields on new purchases due to interest rate increases, and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $13.7 million increase in interest income from our Federal Reserve deposits to $35.2 million, compared to $21.5 million in 2017. The increase was due primarily to higher yields as a result of rate increases in 2018.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest expense for 2018 increased to $75.9 million, compared to $44.8 million for 2017, primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $20.6 million increase in deposits interest expense, due primarily to an increase in interest paid on our interest-bearing money market deposits as a result of market rate adjustments, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $10.5 million increase in borrowings interest expense, due primarily to an increase in our average short-term borrowings balance during 2018 to fund loan growth as a result of the timing of loan funding and deposit activities. The increase in interest expense from short-term borrowings was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from long-term debt reflective of the repayment of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes and the redemption of our Junior Subordinated Debentures in 2017.

Net Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Our net interest margin decreased by 6 basis points to 3.51 percent in 2019, compared to 3.57 percent in 2018 and 3.05 percent in 2017.
2019 compared to 2018
The decrease in our net interest margin in 2019 was reflective primarily of the impact of market rate adjustments made on interest-bearing money market deposits partially offset by the continued shift in the mix of average interest-earning assets towards our higher yielding loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our loan portfolio comprised 50 percent of our average interest-earning assets, an increase from 48 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(1) The “allowance for unfunded credit commitments” is included as a component of “Other liabilities.”

The provision for credit losses is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded credit commitments. Our provision for loan losses is a function of our reserve methodology, which is used to determine an appropriate allowance for loan losses for the period. Our reserve methodology is based on our evaluation of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total gross loans using historical and other objective information, and on our qualitative assessment of the inherent and identified credit risk of the loan portfolio. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments is determined using a methodology that is similar to the methodology used for calculating the allowance for loan losses, adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at funding. Our provision for credit losses equals our best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolios at the balance sheet date. For a more detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above, “Consolidated Financial Condition-Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan Losses” below and Note 10—“Loans, Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on our allowance for loan losses.

Table of Contents

Provision for Loan Losses
 We had a provision for loan losses of $94.2 million in 2019, compared to a provision of $84.3 million in 2018 and a provision of $85.9 million in 2017. The provision for loan losses of $94.2 million in 2019 was reflective primarily of $38.7 million from period-end loan growth, $56.3 million in net new specific reserves for nonaccrual loans and $43.2 million from charge-offs not specifically reserved for, partially offset by a decrease of $23.0 million for our performing loans and $21.0 million of recoveries.
The provision for loan losses of $84.3 million in 2018 was reflective primarily of $46.6 million from period-end loan growth, $39.0 million in net new specific reserves for nonaccrual loans and $26.7 million from charge-offs not specifically reserved for, partially offset by a benefit of $20.7 million from overall improved credit quality of our loan portfolio reflective of the increase of our private equity/venture capital loans, which tend to be of higher credit quality.
The provision for loan losses of $85.9 million in 2017 was reflective primarily of $62.7 million in net new specific reserves for nonaccrual loans and $29.1 million from period-end loan growth, partially offset by a benefit from overall improved credit quality of our loan portfolio reflective of the increase of our private equity/venture capital loans.
Provision for Unfunded Credit Commitments
We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $12.2 million in 2019, compared to a provision of $3.6 million in 2018 and $6.4 million in 2017. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in 2019 was driven primarily by growth in unfunded credit commitments of $5.3 billion.
We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $3.6 million in 2018. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in 2018 was driven primarily by increased reserves of $7.9 million from growth in unfunded credit commitments, partially offset by a benefit of $4.7 million from overall improved credit quality of our loan portfolio as mentioned above.
We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $6.4 million in 2017. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in 2017 was driven primarily by qualitative allocations based on our loan portfolio being comprised of larger loans and additional reserves as a result of the increase in unfunded credit commitments.

Noninterest Income
For the year ended December 31, 2019, noninterest income was $1.2 billion, compared to $745.0 million and $557.2 million for the comparable 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interests was $1.2 billion, compared to $707.0 million and $527.8 million for the comparable 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, non-GAAP core fee income plus investment banking revenue and commissions was $893.4 million, compared to $515.9 million and $379.0 million for the comparable 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, non-GAAP core fee income was $641.8 million, compared to $515.9 million and $379.0 million for the comparable 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. (See reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used below under "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".)
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance (including, but not limited to, non-GAAP core fee income, non-GAAP core fee income plus investment banking revenue and commissions, non-GAAP noninterest income and non-GAAP net gains on investment securities). These supplemental performance measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirement.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding items that represent income attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries and certain other non-recurring items. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Included in noninterest income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. We recognize, as part of our investment funds management business through SVB Capital, the entire income or loss from funds consolidated in accordance with ASC Topic 810 as discussed in Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report. We are required under GAAP to consolidate 100% of the results of these entities, even though we may own less than 100% of such entities. The relevant amounts attributable to investors other

than us are reflected under “Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests” on our statements of income. Where applicable, the tables below for noninterest income and net gains on investment securities exclude noncontrolling interests.
Core fee income is a non-GAAP financial measure, which represents GAAP noninterest income, but excludes (i) certain line items where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control, primarily our net gains (losses) on investment securities and equity warrant assets, (ii) our investment banking revenue and commissions and (iii) other noninterest income. Core fee income includes client investment fees, foreign exchange fees, credit card fees, deposit service charges, lending related fees and letters of credit and standby letters of credit fees.
Core fee income plus investment banking revenue and commissions is a non-GAAP measure, which represents GAAP noninterest income, but excludes certain line items where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control, primarily our net gains (losses) on investment securities and equity warrant assets, and other noninterest income. Core fee income plus investment banking revenue and commissions includes core fee income plus investment banking revenue and commissions.

Gains on Investment Securities, Net
Net gains on investment securities include gains and losses from our non-marketable and other equity securities, which include public equity securities held as a result of exercised equity warrant assets, as well as gains and losses from sales of our AFS debt securities portfolio, when applicable.

Table of Contents

Our non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, SPD-SVB, debt funds, private and public portfolio companies and qualified affordable housing projects. We experience variability in the performance of our non-marketable and other equity securities from period to period, which results in net gains or losses on investment securities (both realized and unrealized). This variability is due to a number of factors, including unrealized changes in the values of our investments, changes in the amount of realized gains and losses from distributions, changes in liquidity events and general economic and market conditions. Unrealized gains or losses from non-marketable and other equity securities for any single period are typically driven by valuation changes, and are therefore subject to potential increases or decreases in future periods. Such variability may lead to volatility in the gains or losses from investment securities. As such, our results for a particular period are not necessarily indicative of our expected performance in a future period.
The extent to which any unrealized gains or losses will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of certain sales restrictions to which these equity securities may be subject to (e.g. lock-up agreements), changes in prevailing market prices, market conditions, the actual sales or distributions of securities and the timing of such actual sales or distributions, which, to the extent such securities are managed by our managed funds, are subject to our funds' separate discretionary sales/distributions and governance processes.
Our AFS securities portfolio is a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed with the objective of earning an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Though infrequent, sales of debt securities in our AFS securities portfolio may result in net gains or losses and are conducted pursuant to the guidelines of our investment policy related to the management of our liquidity position and interest rate risk.
In 2019, we had net gains on investment securities of $134.7 million, compared to $88.1 million and $64.6 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Non-GAAP net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests were $86.2 million in 2019, compared to $49.9 million and $35.4 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests of $86.2 million in 2019 were driven by the following:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $37.9 million from our managed funds of funds portfolio, related primarily to net unrealized valuation increases in both private and public company investments held by the funds in the portfolio,

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $33.1 million from our strategic and other investments portfolio, primarily driven by net unrealized valuation increases in both private and public company investments held in our strategic venture capital funds, and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $7.9 million from our managed direct venture funds, related primarily to net unrealized valuation increases in investments held by the funds in the portfolio.

Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests of $49.9 million in 2018 were driven by the following:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $39.9 million from our strategic and other investments portfolio, primarily driven by net unrealized valuation increases in both private and public company investments held in our strategic venture capital funds,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Gains of $29.1 million from our managed funds of funds portfolio, related primarily to net unrealized valuation increases in both private and public company investments held by the funds in the portfolio, and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Losses of $25.2 million from our public equity securities portfolio primarily reflective of net losses on sales of shares of Roku, Inc. ("Roku"), from exercised warrants in 2017, which were sold in the first quarter of 2018.

Client Investment Fees
We offer a variety of investment products on which we earn fees. These products include money market mutual funds, overnight repurchase agreements and sweep money market funds available through the Bank, client-directed accounts offered through SVB Securities, our former broker dealer subsidiary that was deregistered as a broker dealer in the third quarter of 2019, and fixed income management services offered through SVB Asset Management and SVB Wealth Advisory, our investment advisory subsidiaries.

Table of Contents

Client investment fees were $182.1 million in 2019, compared to $130.4 million and $56.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increases were reflective primarily of the large increase in average client investment funds of $16.6 billion and $23.5 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, driven by our clients’ increased utilization of our off-balance sheet sweep money market funds and products managed by SVB Asset Management. In addition, client investment fees also benefited from improved spreads on our client investment funds due to increases in general market rates in both years. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to the reintroduction of fees, associated with our repurchase agreement program, which had been previously waived due to the low rate environment.

Deposit Service Charges
Deposit service charges were $89.2 million in 2019, compared to $76.1 million and $58.7 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increases were attributable to higher deposit client counts as well as higher volumes of our transaction-based fee products. The increase in 2018 was also driven by the introduction of new product solutions and enhanced product pricing.
Lending Related Fees
Lending related fees were $49.9 million in 2019, compared to $41.9 million and $43.3 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in 2019 was due to an increase in loan servicing fees and syndication fee income. The decrease in 2018 was due primarily to an adjustment of $4.5 million, to increase unused commitment fees during 2017, related to fees earned in prior periods from unused lines of credit.

Letters of credit and standby letters of credit fees were $42.7 million in 2019, compared to $34.6 million and $28.5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increases were primarily driven by increases in deferred fee income reflective of larger letter of credit issuances.
Investment Banking Revenue
Investment banking revenue, attributable to the acquisition of SVB Leerink, was $195.2 million in 2019 consisting primarily of underwriting fees. A summary of investment banking revenue by type for 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

Other Noninterest Income
Total other noninterest income was $55.4 million in 2019, compared to income of $51.9 million in 2018 and $59.1 million in 2017. The increase was due primarily to increases in fund management fees resulting from our acquisition of SVB Leerink on January 4, 2019 and in other service revenue, partially offset by a loss on the early redemption of our $350.0 million 5.375% Senior Notes due 2020. The loss consisted of the amount paid in excess of the principal amount represented a $9.0 million premium due to holders upon early redemption. The decrease of $7.2 million in other noninterest income in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease of $5.2 million in service-based fees and other noninterest income reflective of the sale of our equity valuation services business during 2017.

Non-GAAP Noninterest Expense
We use and report non-GAAP noninterest expense, non-GAAP taxable equivalent revenue and non-GAAP core operating efficiency ratio, which excludes noncontrolling interests and SVB Leerink. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by: (i) excluding certain items that represent expenses attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries, or certain items that do not occur every reporting period; or (ii) providing additional information used by management that is not otherwise required by GAAP or other applicable requirements. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The table below provides a summary of non-GAAP noninterest expense and non-GAAP core operating efficiency ratio, both net of noncontrolling interests:

(1) Other employee incentives and benefits includes employer payroll taxes, group health and life insurance, share-based compensation, 401(k), warrant incentive and retention plans, agency fees and other employee-related expenses.

Compensation and benefits expense was $989.7 million in 2019, compared to $727.0 million in 2018 and $606.4 million in 2017. The key factors driving the increase in compensation and benefits expense in 2019 were as follows:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $111.5 million in salaries and wages expense, reflective primarily of an increase in the number of average FTEs by 677 to 3,362 in 2019, compared to 2,685 in 2018, and annual pay raises. The increase in FTEs was primarily to support our overall growth as well as the acquisition of SVB Leerink which added 230 average FTEs in 2019,

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $85.0 million in incentive compensation expense due primarily to the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our financial results for 2019, partially offset by lower incentive accruals compared to strong 2018 performance levels, and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $66.3 million in other employee compensation and benefits, related to various expenses, particularly the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our financial results for 2019, share-based compensation reflective of an increase in restricted stock compensation due to increased headcount in 2019, an increase in warrant incentive plan expense due to the increased cash liquidations on equity warrant assets in 2019 as compared to 2018 as well as an increase in employer payroll taxes and group health and life insurance reflective of our increased headcount in 2019.

The increase in compensation and benefits expense of $120.6 million in 2018, as compared to 2017, was due primarily to the following:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $56.3 million in incentive compensation expense due primarily to our strong 2018 full-year performance and reflective of our improved ROE relative to our peers, which is one of our key plan performance metrics,

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $47.8 million in salaries and wages expense, reflective primarily of an increase in the number of average FTEs by 289 to 2,685 in 2018, compared to 2,396 in 2017, and annual pay raises. The increase in FTE was primarily to support our overall growth, and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• An increase of $14.8 million in other employee compensation and benefits, related to various expenses, particularly share-based compensation reflective of the increase in our stock price as well as employer payroll taxes and group health and life insurance reflective of our increased headcount in 2018. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our warrant incentive plan expense in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily reflective of our exercise of Roku equity warrants in the fourth quarter of 2017 which resulted in a large accrual of warrant incentive compensation expense in 2017 and subsequent decline of Roku's common stock price, which was sold in 2018, resulting in a lower warrant incentive payout than previously accrued for.

Our variable compensation plans primarily consist of our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive Plan, Deferred Compensation Plan, 401(k) and ESOP Plan, SVB Leerink Incentive Compensation Plan and SVB Leerink Retention Award. Total costs incurred under these plans were $347.3 million in 2019, compared to $239.2 million in 2018 and $183.9 million in 2017. These amounts are included in total compensation and benefits expense discussed above.

Professional Services
Professional services expense was $205.5 million in 2019, compared to $158.8 million in 2018 and $121.9 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 was primarily related to investments in our regulatory, risk management and compliance infrastructure to support our growth both domestically and globally, as well as in projects, systems and technology to support our revenue growth and our global digital banking, and continued global infrastructure, initiatives and other operating costs. Additionally, legal and consulting costs increased in 2019 due to the acquisition of SVB Leerink.
The increase in 2018 was primarily related to enhancements in our regulatory, risk management and compliance infrastructure to support our growth both domestically and globally, as well as investments made in projects, systems and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives and other operating costs. Additionally, we incurred $8.8 million of legal and consulting fees in 2018 associated with the acquisition of SVB Leerink.
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment expense was $96.8 million in 2019, compared to $77.9 million in 2018 and $71.8 million in 2017. The increase related to investments in projects, systems and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives as well as other operating costs.
Net Occupancy
Net occupancy expense was $69.3 million in 2019, compared to $54.8 million in 2018 and $48.4 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to lease renewals at higher costs, reflective of market conditions, and the expansion of certain offices to support our growth. Additionally, for 2019, $7.4 million was attributable to the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our financial results effective January 4, 2019.
FDIC and State Assessments
FDIC and state assessments expense was $18.5 million in 2019, compared to $34.3 million in 2018 and $35.1 million in 2017. The decrease in FDIC and state assessments expense in 2019 was due primarily to the elimination of the FDIC surcharge for banks effective October 1, 2018, reflective of the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio reaching its minimum funding requirements.

Included in net income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. The relevant amounts allocated to investors in our consolidated subsidiaries, other than us, are reflected under “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” on our consolidated statements of income.
In the table below, noninterest income consists primarily of investment gains and losses from our consolidated funds. Noninterest expense is primarily related to management fees paid by our managed funds to SVB Financial's subsidiaries as the managed funds’ general partners. A summary of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2019, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $47.9 million in 2019, compared to $37.5 million in 2018. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $47.9 million for 2019 was primarily a result of the following:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Net gains on investment securities (including carried interest allocation) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $48.5 million ($20.2 million excluding carried interest allocation) primarily from our managed funds of funds and our managed direct venture funds portfolios, related primarily to net unrealized valuation increases in both private and public company investments held by the funds in the portfolios, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Noninterest expense of $0.8 million, primarily related to management fees paid by the noncontrolling interests to our subsidiaries that serve as the general partner.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $37.5 million in 2018, compared to $28.7 million in 2017. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $37.5 million for 2018 was primarily a result of the following:

Income Taxes
Our effective income tax expense rate was 27.2 percent in 2019, compared to 26.5 percent in 2018 and 42.0 percent in 2017. Our effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax expense by the sum of income before income tax expense and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The components of our effective tax rates for 2019, 2018 and 2017 are discussed in Note 19—“Income Taxes” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
The increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation driven by a decrease in the number of stock options exercised during 2019 due to the decline in the stock price from the record highs during 2018.
The reduction in our effective tax rate for 2018 was primarily due to the lower Federal corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJ Act") effective January 1, 2018. The effective tax rate for each of 2018 and 2017 included the recognition of tax benefits of $18.0 million due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.

Income before income tax expense from our GCB increased to $1.5 billion in 2019, compared to $1.3 billion in 2018 and $0.9 billion in 2017, which reflected the continued growth of our core commercial business and clients. The key components of GCB's performance are discussed below:
2019 compared to 2018
Net interest income from GCB increased by $226.9 million in 2019, due primarily to an increase in loan interest income resulting from an increase in average loan balances and higher loan yields as well as an increase in FTP earned for an increase in average deposits.
Noninterest income increased by $117.6 million in 2019, related primarily to an increase in our core fees (higher client investment fees, foreign exchange fees, credit card fees and deposit service charges). The increase in client investment fees was due to higher client investment fund balances as well as from improved spreads on our client investment funds due to increases in general market rates. The increase in foreign exchange fees was due primarily to increased trade volumes driven by the continuing increase in the number of clients actively managing currency exposures. The increase in credit card fees was primarily due to an increase in net interchange fees reflective of increased client utilization of our credit card products and enhanced payment solutions provided to new and existing clients. The increase in deposit service charges was reflective of higher deposit client counts, as well as higher transaction volumes from existing clients.
Noninterest expense increased by $81.7 million in 2019, due primarily to increased expenses for compensation and benefits and professional services. Compensation and benefits expenses increased as a result of higher salaries and wages expenses and higher other employee compensation and benefits, partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. The increase in GCB salaries and wages expenses was due primarily to an increase in the average number of FTEs at GCB, which increased by 328 to 2,350 FTEs in 2019, compared to 2,022 FTEs in 2018. The increase in total other employee benefits was related to various expenses, particularly share-based compensation as well as employer payroll taxes and group health and life insurance reflective of our increased headcount in 2019. Professional services expenses increased primarily related to enhancements in our regulatory, risk management and compliance infrastructure to support our growth both domestically and globally, as well as investments made in projects, systems and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives and other operating costs.

Table of Contents

2018 compared to 2017
Net interest income from GCB increased by $349.1 million in 2018, due primarily to an increase in loan interest income resulting from an increase in average loan balances and higher loan yields as well as an increase in FTP earned for an increase in average deposits.
Noninterest income increased by $128.2 million in 2018, related primarily to an increase in our core fees (higher client investment fees, foreign exchange fees, credit card fees and deposit service charges). The increase in client investment fees was due to higher client investment fund balances as well as from improved spreads on our client investment funds due to increases in general market rates. The increase in foreign exchange fees was due primarily to an increase in our client count as well as volume related to increased client engagement. The increase in credit card fees was primarily reflective of increased client utilization of our credit card products and enhanced payment solutions provided to new and existing clients, partially offset by higher rebate/rewards expense. The increase in deposit service charges was reflective of higher deposit client counts, as well as higher transaction volumes from existing clients.
Noninterest expense increased by $85.5 million in 2018, due primarily to increased expenses for compensation and benefits. Compensation and benefits expenses increased as a result of higher salaries and wages expenses, higher incentive compensation and higher other employee compensation and benefits. The increase in GCB salaries and wages expenses was due primarily to an increase in the average number of FTEs at GCB, which increased by 183 to 2,022 FTEs in 2018, compared to 1,839 FTEs in 2017. The increase in GCB incentive compensation expense was due to our strong 2018 full-year performance and reflective of our improved ROE relative to our peers, which is one of our key plan performance metrics. The increase in total other employee benefits was related to various expenses, particularly share-based compensation as well as employer payroll taxes and group health and life insurance reflective of our increased headcount in 2018.

Income before income tax expense from SVB Private Bank decreased to $11.9 million in 2019, compared to $38.8 million in 2018. Income before income tax expense was $38.2 million in 2017. The key drivers of SVB Private Bank's performance are discussed below:
2019 compared to 2018
Net interest income decreased by $13.9 million in 2019, due primarily to an increase of $0.5 billion in average loans resulting in an increase in FTP charged to SVB Private Bank.
Noninterest expense increased by $15.1 million in 2019, due primarily to increased expenses for compensation and benefits and professional services. Compensation and benefits expenses increased primarily due to the allocation of client service administration FTE to SVB Private Bank as well as the continued increase in the number of average FTEs. Professional services expenses increased primarily related to enhancements in our regulatory, risk management and compliance infrastructure to support our growth both domestically and globally, as well as investments made in projects, systems and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives and other operating costs.
2018 compared to 2017
Net interest income increased by $6.8 million in 2018, due primarily to an increase in loan interest income from an increase in average loan balances and higher loan yields.

Table of Contents

Noninterest expense increased by $7.4 million in 2018, primarily as a result of higher salaries and wages expenses as we continue to increase the number of average FTEs at SVB Private Bank, which increased by 16 to 67 FTEs in 2018, compared to 51 FTEs in 2017, and due to higher incentive compensation reflective of our strong 2018 full-year performance.

Available-for-Sale Securities
Period-end AFS securities were $14.0 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $7.8 billion at December 31, 2018, and $11.1 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase of $6.2 billion in 2019 was primarily due to purchases of new investments of $9.9 billion, partially offset by $1.6 billion in paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities and sales of $2.2 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized gains or losses in a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Period-end AFS securities at December 31, 2018 decreased $3.3 billion, compared to 2017 primarily due to $3.4 billion in paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities and sales of $0.5 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations, partially offset by purchases of new investments of $0.7 billion.
The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income securities, carried at fair value, classified as AFS as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities, which are reported at fair value. For U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. agency debentures and foreign government debt securities, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected remaining maturities for certain U.S. agency debentures may occur earlier than their contractual maturities because the note issuers have the right to call outstanding amounts ahead of their contractual maturity. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as AFS typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments. The weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

Held-to-Maturity Securities
Period-end HTM securities were $13.8 billion at December 31, 2019, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 10.6 percent, compared to $15.5 billion at December 31, 2018. The decrease was due to paydowns and scheduled maturities of $2.1 billion, partially offset by new purchases of $0.5 billion.
Period-end HTM securities were $15.5 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.8 billion, or 22.3 percent, compared to $12.7 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was due to new purchases of $4.7 billion, with $3.9 billion of agency backed mortgage securities purchases and $0.8 billion of municipal bond purchases, partially offset by $1.9 billion in portfolio paydowns and maturities.
Securities classified as HTM are accounted for at cost with no adjustments for changes in fair value. For securities re-designated as HTM from AFS, the unrealized gains at the date of transfer will continue to be reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity and are being amortized over the life of the securities in a manner consistent with the amortization of a premium or discount.
The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income investment securities classified as HTM as of December 31, 2019. Interest income on certain municipal bonds and notes (non-taxable investments) are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 percent. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities. For U.S. agency debentures, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as HTM typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments. The weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

Portfolio duration is a standard measure used to approximate changes in the market value of fixed income instruments due to a change in market interest rates. The measure is an estimate based on the level of current market interest rates, expectations for changes in the path of forward rates and the effect of forward rates on mortgage prepayment speed assumptions. As such, portfolio duration will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Changes in portfolio duration are also impacted by changes in the mix of longer versus shorter term-to-maturity securities. At December 31, 2019, our estimated fixed income securities portfolio weighted-average duration was 3.9 years, compared to 3.8 and 3.0 years at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Non-Marketable and Other Equity Securities
Non-marketable and other equity securities were $1.2 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $272.7 million, or 29.0 percent, compared to $941.1 million at December 31, 2018, which increased by $290.0 million, or 44.6 percent, compared to $651.1 million at December 31, 2017. Included in our non-marketable and other equity securities carried under fair value accounting are amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests. We are required under GAAP to consolidate certain SVB Capital funds, even though we may own less than 100 percent of such entities. See below for a summary of the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other equity securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG.
The increase in non-marketable and other equity securities of $272.7 million in 2019 was related primarily attributable to equity securities from exercised warrants, valuation increases in our managed funds of funds investments and new investments within our qualified housing projects portfolio. We also increased our investment in non-marketable and other equity securities by $47.7 million due to the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our financial results as of December 31, 2019.
The increase in non-marketable and other equity securities of $290.0 million in 2018 was related primarily to new investments and the adoption of ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which required equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting) to be measured at fair value and eliminated the cost method of accounting. As part of this adoption we recorded an adjustment to opening retained earnings for cost method investments measured at NAV and increased the carrying value of our unconsolidated venture capital and private equity fund investments by $103.1 million. Additionally, we increased our investments in qualified affordable housing projects by $144.4 million, net of amortization.
The following table summarizes the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other equity securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG (which generally represents the carrying value times our ownership percentage) at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

(2) The carrying values represented investments in 205 and 213 funds (primarily venture capital funds) at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, where our ownership interest is typically less than 5% of the voting interests of each such fund and in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the partnerships operating activities and financial policies. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities which eliminated the concept of cost method accounting. We carry our unconsolidated venture capital and private equity fund investments at fair value based on the fund investments' net asset values per share as obtained from the general partners of the investments. For each fund investment, we adjust the net asset value per share for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment’s net asset value by using the most recently available financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30th, for our December 31st consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period. We recorded a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings on January 1, 2018 for the difference between fair value and cost for these fund investments. The estimated fair values and carrying values of these venture capital and private equity fund investments were $178.2 million and $201.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, these investments were carried at cost and had a carrying value of $98.5 million.

(3) Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which eliminated the concept of cost method accounting. On a prospective basis, we report our other investments in the line item "Other investments without a readily determinable fair value." These investments include direct equity investments in private companies. The carrying value is based on the price at which the investment was acquired plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. We consider a range of factors when adjusting the fair value of these investments, including, but not limited to, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment and a discount for certain investments that have lock-up restrictions or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted. For further details on the carrying value of these investments refer to Note 9—“Investment Securities" of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

(4) Investments classified as other equity securities (fair value accounting) represent shares held in public companies as a result of exercising public equity warrant assets and direct equity investments in public companies held by our consolidated funds. Effective January 1, 2018 we adopted ASU 2016-01 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which requires equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income. Prior to January 1, 2018, we reported equity securities in public companies that we held as a result of exercising public equity warrant assets in available-for-sale securities. These equity securities are reported in non-marketable and other equity securities.

Volcker Rule

On June 6, 2017, we received notice that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve approved the Company’s application for an extension of the permitted conformance period for the Company’s investments in “illiquid” covered funds. The approval extends the deadline by which the Company must sell, divest, restructure or otherwise conform such investments to the provisions of the Volcker Rule until the earlier of (i) July 21, 2022 or (ii) the date by which each fund matures by its terms or is otherwise conformed to the Volcker Rule.
As implemented under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Volcker Rule prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, a banking entity, such as the Company, from sponsoring or investing in covered funds, defined to include many venture capital and private equity funds. As noted above, the Company currently maintains certain investments deemed to be prohibited covered fund investments, which as of December 31, 2019, had an estimated aggregate carrying value and fair value of approximately $213 million. (For more information about the Volcker Rule, see "Business - Supervision and Regulatory - Proprietary Trading and Relationships with Certain Funds" under Part I, Item I of this report.)

Both commercial and consumer loans increased from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 with the largest increases coming from our private equity/venture capital and consumer real estate industry segments. The growth from our private equity/venture capital clients was due to increased utilization from our capital call lines of credit and the growth in our consumer real estate segment was reflective primarily of healthy new client acquisition.

At December 31, 2018, gross loans equal to or greater than $20 million to any single client (individually or in the aggregate) totaled $14.5 billion, or 50.8 percent of our portfolio. These loans represented 361 clients, and of these loans, $27.5 million were on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2018.
The credit profile of our loan portfolio clients varies based on the nature of the lending we do for different market segments. Our three main market segments are (i) technology (software/internet and hardware) and life science/healthcare, (ii) private equity/venture capital and (iii) SVB Private Bank.

72

Table of Contents

(i) Technology and Life Science/Healthcare
 Our technology and life science/healthcare loan portfolios include loans to clients at the various stages of their life cycles and represent the largest segments of our loan portfolio. The primary underwriting method for our technology and life science/healthcare portfolios are classified as investor dependent, balance sheet dependent or cash flow dependent.

Investor dependent loans represented a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at 10 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2019 and 11 percent at December 31, 2018. These loans are made to companies in both our Accelerator (early-stage) and Growth practices. Investor dependent loans typically have modest or negative cash flows and no established record of profitable operations. Repayment of these loans may be dependent upon receipt by borrowers of additional equity financing from venture capital firms or others, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party or an IPO. Venture capital firms may provide financing selectively, at reduced amounts, or on less favorable terms, which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers' ability to repay their loans to us. When repayment is dependent upon the next round of venture investment and there is an indication that further investment is unlikely or will not occur, it is often likely that the company would need to be sold to repay the debt in full. If reasonable efforts have not yielded a likely buyer willing to repay all debt at the close of the sale or on commercially viable terms, the account will most likely be deemed to be impaired.

Balance sheet dependent loans, which includes asset-based loans, represented seven percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2019 compared to eight percent at December 31, 2018. Balance sheet dependent loans are structured to require constant current asset coverage (i.e. cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable and, to a much lesser extent, inventory) in an amount that exceeds the outstanding debt. These loans are generally made to companies in our Growth and Corporate Finance practices. Our asset-based lending, which includes working capital lines and accounts receivable financing, represented two and one percent of total gross loans as of both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The repayment of these arrangements is dependent on the financial condition, and payment ability, of third parties with whom our clients do business.

Cash flow dependent loans, which include sponsored buyout lending, represented 14 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2019, compared to 16 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2018. Cash flow dependent loans require the borrower to maintain cash flow from operations that is sufficient to service all debt. Borrowers must demonstrate normalized cash flow in excess of all fixed charges associated with operating the business. Sponsored buyout loans represented six percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2019, compared to eight percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2018. These loans are typically used to assist a select group of experienced private equity sponsors with the acquisition of businesses, are larger in size, and repayment is generally dependent upon the cash flows of the acquired company. The acquired companies are typically established, later-stage businesses of scale and characterized by reasonable levels of leverage and loan structures that include meaningful financial covenants. The sponsor's equity contribution is often 50 percent or more of the acquisition price.

(ii) Private Equity/Venture Capital
We also provide financial services to clients in the private equity/venture capital community. At December 31, 2019, our lending to private equity/venture capital firms and funds represented 54 percent of total gross loans, compared to 50 percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2018. The vast majority of this portfolio consists of capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms. These facilities are generally governed by meaningful financial covenants oriented towards ensuring that the funds' remaining callable capital is sufficient to repay the loan, and larger commitments (typically provided to larger private equity funds) are often secured by an assignment of the general partner's right to call capital from the fund's limited partner investors.

(iii) SVB Private Bank
Our SVB Private Bank clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies. Our lending to SVB Private Bank clients represented 11 percent of total gross loans at both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Many of these clients have mortgages, which represented 87 percent of this portfolio at December 31, 2019; the balance of this portfolio consisted of home equity lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, capital call lines of credit and other secured and unsecured lending.

Loan Administration
The Credit Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our credit risks and strategies, as well as our key credit policies and lending practices.
Subject to the oversight of the Credit Committee, lending authority is delegated to our Chief Credit Officer and other senior members of our lending management based on certain size and underwriting criteria.
Credit Quality Indicators
As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our total criticized loans and impaired loans represented three and four percent of our total gross loans, respectively. Criticized loans and impaired loans to early-stage clients represented 22 percent and 19 percent of our total criticized loans and impaired loan balances at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Loans to early-stage clients represent a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at five and six percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. It is common for an early-stage client’s remaining liquidity to fall temporarily below the threshold for a pass-rated credit during its capital-raising period for a new round of funding. Based on our experience, for most early-stage clients, this situation typically lasts one to two quarters and generally resolves itself with a subsequent round of venture funding, though there are exceptions, from time to time. As a result, we expect that each of our early-stage clients will reside in our criticized portfolio during a portion of their life cycle.

Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets consist of loans on nonaccrual status, loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest, and Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) and other foreclosed assets. We measure all loans placed on nonaccrual status for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or the net present value of the expected cash flows. The table below sets forth certain data and ratios between nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and the allowance for loan losses:

Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans decreased 8 basis points to 0.91 percent at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.99 percent at December 31, 2018. The decrease is reflective of a seven basis point decrease in the reserves for gross performing loans. Our reserve percentage for performing loans as a percentage of total gross performing loans decreased to 0.78 percent at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.86 percent at December 31, 2018, reflective of the continued shift in the mix of our overall loan portfolio to our higher quality private equity/venture capital loan portfolio. Our reserve percentage for nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total gross loans remained flat at 0.13 percent at both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

---------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- ------- - -------

 Year ended December 31,

Charge-offs (55,224 ) (43,857 )
Other reductions (82 ) (99 )
Balance, end of period $ 102,669 $ 94,142

Our nonaccrual loan balance increased $8.5 million to $102.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $94.1 million at December 31, 2018. The $8.5 million increase was primarily attributable to our life science/healthcare portfolio. Our life science/healthcare nonaccrual loan portfolio increased $8.6 million primarily due to $18.3 million in new nonaccruals for three clients in our Growth practice, partially offset by $7.6 million of paydowns for two clients in our Growth practice and sponsored buyout loan portfolio and a $2.4 million decrease for one sponsored buyout loan due to partial charge-off during 2019.
Our nonaccrual loans as of December 31, 2019 included $75.0 million from six clients (three software/internet clients represented $52.0 million and three life science/healthcare clients represented $22.9 million). One of these loans is a sponsored buyout loan that was added to our nonaccrual portfolio in 2015, one is a Growth client that was added in 2018 and four are new nonaccrual loans added during 2019, three Growth clients and one sponsored buyout loan. The total credit exposure for these six largest nonaccrual loans was $75.1 million as of December 31, 2019, for which we have specifically reserved $35.3 million.
Average nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $160.3 million, $117.1 million, $123.8 million, $108.7 million, and $80.3 million, respectively. The increase in average nonaccrual loans was attributable to the increase in nonaccrual loans from our life science/healthcare loan portfolio related to the new nonaccruals for the clients mentioned above. If the nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 had not been nonperforming, $5.6 million, $7.4 million, $7.7 million, $4.6 million and $4.5 million, respectively, in interest income would have been recorded.

(1) See “Derivatives” section below.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Assets
The increase of $658.0 million in foreign exchange spot contract assets was primarily due to an overall increase in the amount of unsettled spot trades reflective of several large trades at year-end December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.
Net Deferred Tax Assets
The decrease of $37.0 million in net deferred tax assets was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of our AFS securities portfolio driven by decreases in market interest rates as compared to December 31, 2018.
Other Assets
Other assets includes various asset amounts for other operational transactions. The increase of $86.0 million was primarily due to the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our financial results, which included a $38.6 million increase from receivables. Additionally, the increase resulted from a $25.6 million increase in current tax receivables, due to quarterly tax payments exceeding our estimated full year taxable income as of December 31, 2019 and a $15.2 million increase in merchant card receivables due to the timing of settlement.

Equity Warrant Assets
In connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of equity warrant assets in primarily private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. At December 31, 2019, we held warrants in 2,268 companies, compared to 2,095 companies at December 31, 2018. Warrants in 20 companies each had values greater than $1.0 million and collectively represented $57.6 million, or 34.8 percent, of the fair value of the total warrant portfolio. The change in fair value of equity warrant assets is recorded in gains on equity warrant assets, net, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. The following table provides a summary of transactions and valuation changes for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:

Terminated equity warrant assets (3,502 ) (5,964 )
Balance, end of period $ 165,473 $ 149,238

Foreign Exchange Forward and Foreign Currency Option Contracts
We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in foreign activities, either as the purchaser or seller, depending upon the clients' need. For each forward or option contract entered into with our clients, we enter into an opposite way forward or option contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in currency rates. We also enter into forward contracts with correspondent banks to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure related to certain foreign currency denominated instruments. Net gains and losses on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated instruments are recorded in the line item "Other" as part of noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. We have not experienced nonperformance by any of our counterparties and therefore have not incurred any related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties. Our net exposure for foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts, net of cash collateral, was $22.2 million at December 31, 2019 and $20.7 million at December 31, 2018. For additional information on our foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, see Note 16—“Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Client Interest Rate Derivatives
We sell interest rate contracts to clients who wish to mitigate their interest rate exposure. We economically reduce the interest rate risk from this business by entering into opposite way contracts with correspondent banks. Our net exposure for client interest rate derivative contracts, net of cash collateral, was $28.6 million at December 31, 2019 and $8.7 million at December 31, 2018. For information on our client interest rate derivatives, refer to Note 16—“Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Interest Rate Swaps
To manage interest rate risk on our variable-interest rate loan portfolio, we enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge against future changes in interest rates by using hedging instruments to lock in future cash inflows that would otherwise be impacted by movements in the market interest rates. We designate these interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815 and record them in other assets and other liabilities. Our net exposure for interest rate swaps, net of cash collateral, was zero at December 31, 2019. For information on our interest rate swaps, refer to Note 16—“Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Total deposits $ 61,757,807 $ 49,328,900 $ 44,254,075

The increase in deposits of $12.4 billion in 2019 was driven primarily by a healthy equity funding environment across a majority of our market segments with robust activities in the IPO and secondary public offering markets as well as strong new client acquisition. In addition, we saw a continued shift in the mix of our on-balance sheet deposits with growth in our interest-bearing deposits reflective of our deposit growth initiatives and continued strong liquidity of our clients. No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our business. Approximately 13 percent, 16 percent and 14 percent of our total deposits at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were from our clients in Asia.
The increase in deposits of $5.1 billion in 2018 was driven primarily by a healthy equity funding environment across a majority of our market segments with robust activities in the IPO and secondary public offering markets as well as strong new client acquisition.
At December 31, 2019, 34 percent of our total deposits were interest-bearing deposits, compared to 21 percent at December 31, 2018 and 17 percent at December 31, 2017. The increases were driven by active management of deposit products as well as new product offerings.
At December 31, 2019, the aggregate balance of time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $100,000 totaled $185 million, compared to $46 million at December 31, 2018 and $41 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2019, $182 million in time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $100,000 were scheduled to mature within one year. The maturity profile of our time deposits as of December 31, 2019 is as follows:

--- --------------------------------
(1) See “Derivatives” section above.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Liabilities
The increase of $718.0 million in foreign exchange spot contract liabilities was due primarily to an increase in the amount of unsettled spot trades at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.
Accrued Compensation
Accrued compensation includes amounts for our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive Plan, ESOP, SVB Leerink Incentive Compensation Plan, SVB Leerink Retention Award and other compensation arrangements. The increase of $130.0 million was due primarily to the result of higher incentive compensation accruals attributable to SVB Leerink FTEs as a result of strong 2019 performance as well as the increase in the number of average FTEs in 2019. For a description of our variable compensation plans, refer to Note 20—“Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Other Liabilities
Other liabilities increased $135.0 million to $593.4 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $458.4 million at December 31, 2018, reflective primarily of a $96.3 million net increase in new commitments for our qualified affordable tax credit funds, a $14.2 million increase in FX trade liability due to large outstanding trades and a $10.3 million increase in deferred compensation due to increases in the fair value of the underlying investments. In addition, an increase of $16.7 million in other liabilities was attributable to the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our financial results at December 31, 2019.

Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests totaled $150.8 million and $148.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was due to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $47.9 million as well as an additional $5.3 million attributable to the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our financial results, partially offset by net capital distributions of $51.0 million primarily to investors in our managed funds of funds for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information, refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Capital Resources
We maintain an adequate capital base to support anticipated asset growth, operating needs, and credit and other business risks, and to provide for SVB Financial and the Bank to be in compliance with applicable regulatory capital guidelines, including the joint agency rules implementing the "Basel III" capital rules. Our primary sources of new capital include retained earnings and proceeds from the sale and issuance of our capital stock or other securities. Under the oversight of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, management engages in regular capital planning processes in an effort to optimize the use of the capital available to us and to appropriately plan for our future capital needs. The capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and allocates capital to both existing and future business activities. Expected future use or activities for which capital may be set aside include balance sheet growth and associated relative increases in market or credit exposure, investment activity, potential product and business expansions, acquisitions and strategic or infrastructure investments. In addition, we conduct capital stress tests as part of our annual capital planning process. The capital stress tests allow us to assess the impact of adverse changes in the economy and interest rates on our capital adequacy position.
Common Stock
On November 13, 2018, the Company announced a program to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding common stock (the "Stock Repurchase Program"). The program completed on July 1, 2019, after we repurchased and retired 2.2 million shares of our outstanding common stock totaling $499.6 million. The program completed on July 1, 2019.
On October 24, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program that enables the Company to repurchase up to $350 million of its outstanding common stock, though no shares have yet been repurchased under the new stock repurchase program. This program expires on October 29, 2020. The extent to which the Company repurchases its shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements, availability of funds, and other relevant considerations, as determined by the Company. The Company may, in its discretion, begin, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time prior to the program’s expiration, without any prior notice. Repurchases may also be made pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so because of self-imposed trading blackout periods or other regulatory restrictions.
Share repurchases subsequent to December 31, 2019
As of February 27, 2020, we have repurchased 244,223 shares of our common stock totaling $60.0 million at an average share price of $245.76.
Preferred Stock
On December 9, 2019, the Company issued depositary shares each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in 350,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with $0.001 par value and liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, or $25 per depositary share. The Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or other obligation of SVB Financial Group. Dividends are approved by the Board of Directors and, if declared, are payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate per annum equal to 5.25 percent.
As of December 31, 2019, there were 350,000 shares issued and outstanding of Series A Preferred Stock, which had a carrying value of $340.1 million and liquidation preference of $350 million.
SVBFG Stockholders’ Equity
SVBFG stockholders’ equity totaled $6.5 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 26.5 percent compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily the result of net income of $1.1 billion in 2019, an increase in capital of $340.1 million related to the issuance of preferred stock, and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income reflective primarily of a $193.7 million ($139.9 million net of tax) increase in the fair value of our AFS securities portfolio driven by decreases in period-end market interest rates. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in retained earnings of $352.5 million related to the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program.
Funds generated through retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to continue to be so in the future.

Capital Ratios
Regulatory capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank exceeded minimum federal regulatory guidelines under the current Capital Rules as well as for a well-capitalized bank holding company and insured depository institution, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. See Note 24—“Regulatory Matters” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. Capital ratios for SVB Financial and the Bank, compared to the minimum capital ratios are set forth below:

2019 compared to 2018
Risk-based capital ratios (CET 1, tier 1, and total risk-based capital) for SVB Financial decreased as of December 31, 2019, compared to the same ratios as of December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of a proportionally higher increase in our risk-weighted assets relative to the increase in capital during 2019. The increase in risk-weighted assets was driven primarily by robust loan growth during 2019. The increase in tier 1 and total risk-based capital was reflective primarily of net income of $1.1 billion and $340.1 million for our Series A Preferred Stock issuance. The increase in CET 1 capital was reflective primarily of net income. SVB Financial's tier 1 leverage ratio remained flat as of December 31, 2019, as compared to December 31, 2018.
Risk-based capital ratios (CET 1, tier 1, total risk-based capital, and tier 1 leverage) for Silicon Valley Bank (the "Bank") decreased as of December 31, 2019, compared to the same ratios as of December 31, 2018. The decreases were a result of the proportionally higher increase in our risk-weighted assets and average assets relative to the increase in capital during 2019. The increase in risk-weighted assets and average assets were driven by robust loan growth during 2019. The increases in capital due to net income were partially offset by $733 million of cash dividends paid by the Bank to our bank holding company, SVB Financial, during 2019.
 All our reported capital ratios remain above the levels considered to be "well capitalized" under applicable banking regulations.
2018 compared to 2017
Risk-based capital ratios (CET 1, tier 1, and total risk-based capital) for SVB Financial and the Bank increased as of December 31, 2018, compared to the same ratios as of December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a proportionally higher increase in capital relative to the increase in our risk-weighted assets during 2018. The increase in capital was reflective primarily of net income of $973.8 million as well as a net increase of $68.8 million related to the adoption of new accounting guidance in 2018, partially

offset by a decrease of $147.1 million related to the repurchase of our outstanding common stock under the Stock Repurchase Program. The increase in risk-weighted assets was due primarily to our robust loan growth in 2018.
Both SVB Financial and the Bank's tier 1 leverage ratios increased as of December 31, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017, due to proportionally higher capital relative to average assets growth during 2018.
Non-GAAP Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets and Non-GAAP Tangible Common Equity to Risk-weighted Assets
The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios are not required by GAAP or applicable bank regulatory requirements. However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these ratios in evaluating the adequacy of the Company’s capital levels; however, this financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These ratios are calculated by dividing total SVBFG stockholder’s equity, by total period-end assets and risk-weighted assets, after reducing both amounts by acquired intangibles, if any. The manner in which this ratio is calculated varies among companies. Accordingly, our ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar measures of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP:

2019 compared to 2018
SVB Financial's and the Bank's tangible common equity to tangible assets and risk-weighted assets ratios decreased due to the proportionally higher increases in tangible and risk-weighted assets relative to tangible common equity. The increase in risk-tangible and risk-weighted assets were driven by robust loan growth during 2019. Increased capital was reflective primarily of net income. The decrease in the Bank's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was partially attributable to $733 million in cash dividends paid by the Bank to SVB Financial during 2019. See "SVBFG Stockholders’ Equity" above for further details on changes to the individual components of our equity balance.
2018 compared to 2017
SVB Financial's and the Bank's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased due to the proportionally higher increase in tangible common equity relative to changes to tangible assets. Increased capital was reflective primarily of net income. SVB Financial's and the Bank's tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets increased due to the proportionally higher increase

in tangible common equity, reflective primarily of net income, relative to changes in risk-weighted assets. The increase in the Bank's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was partially offset as a result of $140 million in cash dividends paid by the Bank to our bank holding company, SVB Financial, during 2018.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
In the normal course of business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, commercial and standby letters of credit and commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity fund investments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than the contractual amount of these commitments because a significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. Refer to the discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 22—“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Excluded from the tables above are unfunded commitment obligations of $19.1 million to our managed funds of funds and other fund investments for which neither the payment, timing, nor eventual obligation is certain. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule (see "Business - Supervision and Regulation" under Part I, Item 1 of this report), we make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a 10-year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling 100% of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over 5 to 7 years; however in certain cases, the funds may not call 100% of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. Additionally, our consolidated managed funds of funds have $5.3 million of remaining unfunded commitments to venture capital and private equity funds. See Note 9—“Investment Securities" of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further disclosure related to non-marketable and other equity securities.

Liquidity
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations, including, as necessary, paying creditors, meeting depositors’ needs, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities and other operating or capital needs, without incurring undue cost or risk, or causing a disruption to normal operating conditions.
We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business activities. Our Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which is a management committee, provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs. Additionally, we routinely conduct liquidity stress testing as part of our liquidity management practices.
Our deposit base is, and historically has been, our primary source of liquidity. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits may fluctuate from time to time due to a variety of factors, including market conditions, prevailing interest rates, changes in client deposit behaviors, availability of insurance protection, and our offering of deposit products. At December 31, 2019, our period-end total deposit balances increased to $61.8 billion, compared to $49.3 billion at December 31, 2018.
Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations, short-term investment securities maturing within one year, AFS securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of one year and anticipated near-term cash flows from investments.
We have certain facilities in place to enable us to access short-term borrowings on a secured and unsecured basis. Our secured facilities include collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco and the discount window at the FRB (using both fixed income securities and loans as collateral). Our unsecured facility consists of our uncommitted federal funds lines. As of December 31, 2019, collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco was comprised primarily of fixed income investment securities and loans and had a carrying value of $4.7 billion, of which $4.3 billion was available to support additional borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, collateral pledged to the discount window at the FRB was comprised of fixed income investment securities and had a carrying value of $1.0 billion, all of which was unused and available to support additional borrowings. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity for our uncommitted federal funds lines totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity under our master repurchase agreements with various financial institutions totaled $3.3 billion at December 31, 2019.
On a stand-alone basis, SVB Financial’s primary liquidity channels include dividends from the Bank, its portfolio of liquid assets, and its ability to raise debt and capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations described in “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Restrictions on Dividends” under Part I, Item 1 of this report.

Note 24. New Accounting Standards: Recently adopted On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Additionally, ASU 2016-02 modifies current guidance for lessors' accounting. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. PMI has identified its lease management system and has identified and evaluated the applicable leases. In addition to the guidance in ASU 2016-02, PMI has evaluated ASU 2018-11, which was issued in July 2018 and provides an optional transitional method. As a result of this evaluation, PMI elected to use the optional transition method, which allows companies to use the effective date as the date of initial application on transition and not adjust comparative period financial information or make the new required disclosures for periods prior to the effective date. Additionally, PMI elected to use the hindsight practical expedient, as well as the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard. Upon adoption, PMI recognized lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its operating leases in place at that time. At January 1, 2019, PMI's adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in an increase of approximately $0.7 billion on its assets and liabilities in its statement of financial position. ASU 2016-02 did not have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. For further details, see Note 23. Leases. On January 1, 2019, PMI elected to early adopt ASU 2018-15 "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal - Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Im...

Table of Contents

Financial assets valued using Level 3 measurements consist of our non-marketable securities (investments in venture capital) and equity warrant assets (rights to shares of private and public company capital stock). The valuation techniques of our non-marketable securities carried under fair value accounting and equity warrant assets involve a significant degree of management judgment. Refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for a summary of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used for each class of Level 3 assets.
The inherent uncertainty in the process of valuing securities for which a ready market does not exist may cause our estimated values of these securities to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the securities existed, and those differences could be material. The timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying companies, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of the underlying companies, general volatility and interest rate market factors, and legal and contractual restrictions. The timing and amount of actual net proceeds, if any, from the disposition of these financial instruments depend upon factors beyond our control, including investor demand for IPOs, levels of M&A activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell and the perceived and actual performance of portfolio companies. All of these factors are difficult to predict and there can be no assurances that we will realize the full value of these securities, which could result in significant losses.
During 2019, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $133.9 million (which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), primarily due to gains on exercised warrant assets. During 2018 and 2017, the Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis experienced net realized and unrealized gains of $88.4 million and $55.2 million (which is inclusive of noncontrolling interest), respectively.
Derivative Assets-Equity Warrant Assets
As discussed above, the valuation of our equity warrant assets is a Level 3 measurement, which requires a significant degree of management judgment in order to value the assets. Our equity warrant asset policy is also considered a critical policy due to the variability of returns from our shares of private and public companies and due to the degree of management judgment in selecting a valuation technique for our equity warrant assets.
The timing and value realized from the disposition of equity warrant assets depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for IPOs, fluctuations in the price of the underlying common stock of these private and public companies, levels of M&A activity and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell the underlying securities. All of these factors are difficult to predict. Many equity warrant assets may be terminated or may expire without compensation and may incur valuation losses from lower-priced funding rounds. We are unable to predict future gains or losses with accuracy, and gains or losses could vary materially from period to period.
Additionally, while management has selected the valuation methodology that it believes provides the best estimate of fair value, there are several acceptable valuation techniques as well as alternative approaches for the calculation of significant inputs for the valuation technique. In the event that a different valuation technique or approach for calculating a significant input were to be used, then the estimated values of these assets could differ significantly from the existing values recorded. Further, the inherent uncertainty of valuing assets for which a ready market is unavailable may cause our estimated values of these assets to differ significantly from the values that would have been derived had a ready market for the assets existed, and those differences could be material and ultimately, the recorded fair value of equity warrant assets may never be realized, which could result in significant losses.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration.

Period-end AFS securities at December 31, 2018 decreased $3.3 billion, compared to 2017 primarily due to $3.4 billion in paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities and sales of $0.5 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations, partially offset by purchases of new investments of $0.7 billion.
The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income securities, carried at fair value, classified as AFS as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities, which are reported at fair value. For U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. agency debentures and foreign government debt securities, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected remaining maturities for certain U.S. agency debentures may occur earlier than their contractual maturities because the note issuers have the right to call outstanding amounts ahead of their contractual maturity. Expected maturities for mortgage-backed securities may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. Mortgage-backed securities classified as AFS typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments. The weighted average yield on mortgage-backed securities is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

Loan Administration
The Credit Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our credit risks and strategies, as well as our key credit policies and lending practices.
Subject to the oversight of the Credit Committee, lending authority is delegated to our Chief Credit Officer and other senior members of our lending management based on certain size and underwriting criteria.
Credit Quality Indicators
As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our total criticized loans and impaired loans represented three and four percent of our total gross loans, respectively. Criticized loans and impaired loans to early-stage clients represented 22 percent and 19 percent of our total criticized loans and impaired loan balances at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Loans to early-stage clients represent a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at five and six percent of total gross loans at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. It is common for an early-stage client’s remaining liquidity to fall temporarily below the threshold for a pass-rated credit during its capital-raising period for a new round of funding. Based on our experience, for most early-stage clients, this situation typically lasts one to two quarters and generally resolves itself with a subsequent round of venture funding, though there are exceptions, from time to time. As a result, we expect that each of our early-stage clients will reside in our criticized portfolio during a portion of their life cycle.

Liquidity
The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations, including, as necessary, paying creditors, meeting depositors’ needs, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities and other operating or capital needs, without incurring undue cost or risk, or causing a disruption to normal operating conditions.
We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business activities. Our Asset/Liability Committee (“ALCO”), which is a management committee, provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs. Additionally, we routinely conduct liquidity stress testing as part of our liquidity management practices.
Our deposit base is, and historically has been, our primary source of liquidity. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits may fluctuate from time to time due to a variety of factors, including market conditions, prevailing interest rates, changes in client deposit behaviors, availability of insurance protection, and our offering of deposit products. At December 31, 2019, our period-end total deposit balances increased to $61.8 billion, compared to $49.3 billion at December 31, 2018.
Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations, short-term investment securities maturing within one year, AFS securities eligible and available for financing or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of one year and anticipated near-term cash flows from investments.
We have certain facilities in place to enable us to access short-term borrowings on a secured and unsecured basis. Our secured facilities include collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco and the discount window at the FRB (using both fixed income securities and loans as collateral). Our unsecured facility consists of our uncommitted federal funds lines. As of December 31, 2019, collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco was comprised primarily of fixed income investment securities and loans and had a carrying value of $4.7 billion, of which $4.3 billion was available to support additional borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, collateral pledged to the discount window at the FRB was comprised of fixed income investment securities and had a carrying value of $1.0 billion, all of which was unused and available to support additional borrowings. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity for our uncommitted federal funds lines totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2019. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity under our master repurchase agreements with various financial institutions totaled $3.3 billion at December 31, 2019.
On a stand-alone basis, SVB Financial’s primary liquidity channels include dividends from the Bank, its portfolio of liquid assets, and its ability to raise debt and capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations described in “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Restrictions on Dividends” under Part I, Item 1 of this report.

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flow Hedges In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of November 29, 2019, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our ant...

• Our HTM debt securities portfolio, with the exception of our municipal bond portfolio, have been evaluated and currently carry zero risk of credit loss as they are securities that are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government. A reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year will be applied to our municipal bonds, however, we do not expect the allowance for credit losses to be significant for this portion of our HTM debt securities portfolio.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Under the prior guidance, our loan portfolio was disclosed by market segments. Going forward, our technology (software/internet and hardware) and life science/healthcare market segments will be disclosed by class of financing receivable that align with their underlying underwriting methodology. The technology (software/internet and hardware) and life science/healthcare market segments will be classified as investor dependent, balance sheet dependent or cash flow dependent and prior period amounts will be reclassified for comparability. There are no other material changes to our current market segments.

Based on our loan and unfunded credit commitments portfolio composition at December 31, 2019, and the current economic environment, we currently estimate the day 1 combined impact of adopting CECL on our allowance for loan losses and allowance for unfunded credit commitments to be an increase of approximately $50 million (on a pre-tax basis) or approximately 13% of the total combined allowance compared to our reported amount at December 31, 2019. The increase reflects an increase in our expected credit loss for our investor dependent loan portfolio as longer-duration assets require more reserves under CECL methodology, offset by a decrease for our private equity/venture capital loan portfolio, given their higher historical credit quality. Based on the credit quality of our existing HTM debt securities portfolio at December 31, 2019, we currently estimate the day one impact of CECL on our allowance for our HTM municipal bond portfolio to be approximately $0.2 million (on a pre-tax basis).
At adoption, we will have a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for our change in the allowance for credit losses for our loans, unfunded credit commitments and HTM debt securities, which will impact our capital. An increase in our allowance will result in a decrease to our regulatory capital amounts and ratios. Federal banking regulatory agencies have provided relief for an initial capital decrease at adoption by allowing the impact to be phased-in over three years on a straight-line basis. At adoption, we do not expect to elect this option as the decrease to our regulatory capital amounts does not have a material impact on our capital ratios.
Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2018, the FASB issued a new Accounting Standard Update (ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement). The ASU primarily modifies certain disclosures with respect to Level 3 fair value measurements. This guidance became effective on January 1, 2020. We adopted the guidance on January 1, 2020, however, the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the disclosures in our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which is part of the Board’s initiative to reduce cost and complexity related to accounting for income taxes.  The ASU eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, Income Taxes, and simplifies income tax accounting in several areas.  The amendments are effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The ASU allows entities to adopt this provision on a retrospective basis for all periods presented or a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and disclosures.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Income and Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income is defined as the difference between: (i) interest earned from loans, fixed income investments in our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios and short-term investment securities, and, (ii) interest paid on funding sources. Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable loans and securities and tax-exempt securities based on the applicable federal statutory tax rate.
Analysis of Net Interest Income Changes Due to Volume and Rate (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “volume change.” Net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as “rate change.” The following table sets forth changes in interest income for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also reflects the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and rate changes for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

Net Interest Income (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
2019 compared to 2018
Net interest income increased by $205.4 million to $2.1 billion in 2019, compared to $1.9 billion in 2018. Overall, the increase in our net interest income was due primarily to higher average loan and interest earning cash and short-term investment securities balances.
 The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2019, compared to 2018, are discussed below:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest income for 2019 increased by $342.2 million primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $240.7 million increase in interest income from loans to $1.6 billion in 2019, compared to $1.4 billion in 2018. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $4.3 billion and an increase in the overall yield on our loan portfolio of 5 basis points to 5.35 percent from 5.30 percent. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, increased by 2 basis points to 4.79 percent from 4.77 percent, reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases in effect the first half of the year, partially offset by the strong growth of our lower yielding private equity/venture capital loan portfolio and interest rate decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Our private equity/venture capital portfolio represented 53.5 percent and 49.5 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively,

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $61.2 million increase in interest income from our short-term investment securities to $96.4 million, compared to $35.2 million in 2018. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $3.1 billion in average interest earning cash and short-term investment securities balances and higher yields reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases in effect the first half of the year, partially offset by interest rate decreases in the third and fourth quarters of 2019, and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $40.3 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to $625.8 million in 2019, compared to $585.4 million in 2018. The increase was reflective of an increase in our fixed income securities yield of 22 basis points to 2.58 percent from 2.36 percent, partially offset by a decrease of $0.5 billion in average fixed income investment balances primarily due to a decrease in average HTM securities. The increase

Table of Contents

in our fixed income securities yield was primarily from higher reinvestment yields on maturing fixed income investments as well as higher yields on new purchases due to the benefit of interest rate increases in effect the first half of the year.
Interest expense for 2019 increased to $212.8 million, compared to $75.9 million for 2018, primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $148.4 million increase in deposits interest expense, due primarily to an increase in interest paid on our interest-bearing money market deposits as a result of market rate adjustments and an increase of $7.8 billion in average interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ An $11.5 million decrease in borrowings interest expense, due primarily to a decrease in our average short-term borrowings balance during 2019 as a result of the increase in average deposit balances.

2018 compared to 2017
Net interest income increased by $479.7 million to $1.9 billion in 2018, compared to $1.4 billion in 2017. Overall, the increase in our net interest income was due primarily to both higher average loan and investment portfolio balances as well as higher interest rates.
The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2018, compared to 2017, are discussed below:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest income for 2018 increased by $510.9 million primarily due to:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $332.7 million increase in interest income from loans to $1.4 billion in 2018, compared to $1.0 billion in 2017. This increase was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $4.5 billion and an increase in the overall yield on our loan portfolio of 45 basis points to 5.30 percent from 4.85 percent. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, increased by 55 basis points to 4.77 percent from 4.22 percent, reflective of the benefit of interest rate increases, partially offset by the strong growth of our lower yielding private equity/ venture capital loan portfolio. Our private equity/venture capital portfolio represented 49.5 percent and 42.8 percent of our total gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $164.5 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities to $585.4 million in 2018, compared to $420.9 million in 2017. The increase was reflective of an increase of $2.4 billion in average fixed income investment balances as a result of strong deposit growth in 2018 and an increase in our fixed income securities yield of 48 basis points to 2.36 percent from 1.88 percent. The increase in our fixed income securities yield was primarily from higher reinvestment yields on maturing fixed income investments as well as higher yields on new purchases due to interest rate increases, and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $13.7 million increase in interest income from our Federal Reserve deposits to $35.2 million, compared to $21.5 million in 2017. The increase was due primarily to higher yields as a result of rate increases in 2018.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Interest expense for 2018 increased to $75.9 million, compared to $44.8 million for 2017, primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $20.6 million increase in deposits interest expense, due primarily to an increase in interest paid on our interest-bearing money market deposits as a result of market rate adjustments, and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
◦ A $10.5 million increase in borrowings interest expense, due primarily to an increase in our average short-term borrowings balance during 2018 to fund loan growth as a result of the timing of loan funding and deposit activities. The increase in interest expense from short-term borrowings was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from long-term debt reflective of the repayment of our 6.05% Subordinated Notes and the redemption of our Junior Subordinated Debentures in 2017.

Net Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)
Our net interest margin decreased by 6 basis points to 3.51 percent in 2019, compared to 3.57 percent in 2018 and 3.05 percent in 2017.
2019 compared to 2018
The decrease in our net interest margin in 2019 was reflective primarily of the impact of market rate adjustments made on interest-bearing money market deposits partially offset by the continued shift in the mix of average interest-earning assets towards our higher yielding loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our loan portfolio comprised 50 percent of our average interest-earning assets, an increase from 48 percent for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(1) The “allowance for unfunded credit commitments” is included as a component of “Other liabilities.”

The provision for credit losses is the combination of both the provision for loan losses and the provision for unfunded credit commitments. Our provision for loan losses is a function of our reserve methodology, which is used to determine an appropriate allowance for loan losses for the period. Our reserve methodology is based on our evaluation of the existing allowance for loan losses in relation to total gross loans using historical and other objective information, and on our qualitative assessment of the inherent and identified credit risk of the loan portfolio. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments is determined using a methodology that is similar to the methodology used for calculating the allowance for loan losses, adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at funding. Our provision for credit losses equals our best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolios at the balance sheet date. For a more detailed discussion of credit quality and the allowance for loan losses, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” above, “Consolidated Financial Condition-Credit Quality and the Allowance for Loan Losses” below and Note 10—“Loans, Allowance for Loan Losses and Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on our allowance for loan losses.

Provision for Loan Losses
 We had a provision for loan losses of $94.2 million in 2019, compared to a provision of $84.3 million in 2018 and a provision of $85.9 million in 2017. The provision for loan losses of $94.2 million in 2019 was reflective primarily of $38.7 million from period-end loan growth, $56.3 million in net new specific reserves for nonaccrual loans and $43.2 million from charge-offs not specifically reserved for, partially offset by a decrease of $23.0 million for our performing loans and $21.0 million of recoveries.
The provision for loan losses of $84.3 million in 2018 was reflective primarily of $46.6 million from period-end loan growth, $39.0 million in net new specific reserves for nonaccrual loans and $26.7 million from charge-offs not specifically reserved for, partially offset by a benefit of $20.7 million from overall improved credit quality of our loan portfolio reflective of the increase of our private equity/venture capital loans, which tend to be of higher credit quality.
The provision for loan losses of $85.9 million in 2017 was reflective primarily of $62.7 million in net new specific reserves for nonaccrual loans and $29.1 million from period-end loan growth, partially offset by a benefit from overall improved credit quality of our loan portfolio reflective of the increase of our private equity/venture capital loans.
Provision for Unfunded Credit Commitments
We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $12.2 million in 2019, compared to a provision of $3.6 million in 2018 and $6.4 million in 2017. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in 2019 was driven primarily by growth in unfunded credit commitments of $5.3 billion.
We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $3.6 million in 2018. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in 2018 was driven primarily by increased reserves of $7.9 million from growth in unfunded credit commitments, partially offset by a benefit of $4.7 million from overall improved credit quality of our loan portfolio as mentioned above.
We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $6.4 million in 2017. Our provision for unfunded credit commitments in 2017 was driven primarily by qualitative allocations based on our loan portfolio being comprised of larger loans and additional reserves as a result of the increase in unfunded credit commitments.

Noninterest Income
For the year ended December 31, 2019, noninterest income was $1.2 billion, compared to $745.0 million and $557.2 million for the comparable 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interests was $1.2 billion, compared to $707.0 million and $527.8 million for the comparable 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, non-GAAP core fee income plus investment banking revenue and commissions was $893.4 million, compared to $515.9 million and $379.0 million for the comparable 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, non-GAAP core fee income was $641.8 million, compared to $515.9 million and $379.0 million for the comparable 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.8 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $3.2 billion, or 89.9 percent, compared to $3.6 billion at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, $3.7 billion of our cash and due from banks was deposited at the FRB and was earning interest at the Federal Funds target rate, and interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions were $2.1 billion. As of December 31, 2018, $1.7 billion, of our cash and due from banks was deposited at the FRB and was earning interest at the Federal Funds target rate and interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions were $1.2 billion.

Investment Securities
Investment securities totaled $29.1 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $4.9 billion, or 20.0 percent, compared to $24.2 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.2 billion, or 0.9 percent, compared to $24.4 billion at December 31, 2017. Our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of: (i) an AFS securities portfolio and a HTM securities portfolio, both of which consist of interest-earning fixed income investment securities; and (ii) a non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio, which represents primarily investments managed as part of our funds management business as well as public equity securities held as a result of exercised equity warrant assets. The major components of the change are explained below.

Available-for-Sale Securities
Period-end AFS securities were $14.0 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $7.8 billion at December 31, 2018, and $11.1 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase of $6.2 billion in 2019 was primarily due to purchases of new investments of $9.9 billion, partially offset by $1.6 billion in paydowns, scheduled maturities and called maturities and sales of $2.2 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations. Securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized gains or losses in a separate component of stockholders']:
NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flow Hedges In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of November 29, 2019, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our ant...

[" as part of noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. We have not experienced nonperformance by any of our counterparties and therefore have not incurred any related losses. Further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties. Our net exposure for foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts, net of cash collateral, was $22.2 million at December 31, 2019 and $20.7 million at December 31, 2018. For additional information on our foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts, see Note 16—“Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Client Interest Rate Derivatives
We sell interest rate contracts to clients who wish to mitigate their interest rate exposure. We economically reduce the interest rate risk from this business by entering into opposite way contracts with correspondent banks. Our net exposure for client interest rate derivative contracts, net of cash collateral, was $28.6 million at December 31, 2019 and $8.7 million at December 31, 2018. For information on our client interest rate derivatives, refer to Note 16—“Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Interest Rate Swaps
To manage interest rate risk on our variable-interest rate loan portfolio, we enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge against future changes in interest rates by using hedging instruments to lock in future cash inflows that would otherwise be impacted by movements in the market interest rates. We designate these interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815 and record them in other assets and other liabilities. Our net exposure for interest rate swaps, net of cash collateral, was zero at December 31, 2019. For information on our interest rate swaps, refer to Note 16—“Derivative Financial Instruments” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Total deposits $ 61,757,807 $ 49,328,900 $ 44,254,075

The increase in deposits of $12.4 billion in 2019 was driven primarily by a healthy equity funding environment across a majority of our market segments with robust activities in the IPO and secondary public offering markets as well as strong new client acquisition. In addition, we saw a continued shift in the mix of our on-balance sheet deposits with growth in our interest-bearing deposits reflective of our deposit growth initiatives and continued strong liquidity of our clients. No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our business. Approximately 13 percent, 16 percent and 14 percent of our total deposits at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were from our clients in Asia.
The increase in deposits of $5.1 billion in 2018 was driven primarily by a healthy equity funding environment across a majority of our market segments with robust activities in the IPO and secondary public offering markets as well as strong new client acquisition.
At December 31, 2019, 34 percent of our total deposits were interest-bearing deposits, compared to 21 percent at December 31, 2018 and 17 percent at December 31, 2017. The increases were driven by active management of deposit products as well as new product offerings.
At December 31, 2019, the aggregate balance of time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $100,000 totaled $185 million, compared to $46 million at December 31, 2018 and $41 million at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2019, $182 million in time deposit accounts individually equal to or greater than $100,000 were scheduled to mature within one year.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Liabilities
The increase of $718.0 million in foreign exchange spot contract liabilities was due primarily to an increase in the amount of unsettled spot trades at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.
Accrued Compensation
Accrued compensation includes amounts for our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive Plan, ESOP, SVB Leerink Incentive Compensation Plan, SVB Leerink Retention Award and other compensation arrangements. The increase of $130.0 million was due primarily to the result of higher incentive compensation accruals attributable to SVB Leerink FTEs as a result of strong 2019 performance as well as the increase in the number of average FTEs in 2019. For a description of our variable compensation plans, refer to Note 20—“Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Other Liabilities
Other liabilities increased $135.0 million to $593.4 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $458.4 million at December 31, 2018, reflective primarily of a $96.3 million net increase in new commitments for our qualified affordable tax credit funds, a $14.2 million increase in FX trade liability due to large outstanding trades and a $10.3 million increase in deferred compensation due to increases in the fair value of the underlying investments. In addition, an increase of $16.7 million in other liabilities was attributable to the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our financial results at December 31, 2019.

Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests totaled $150.8 million and $148.6 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was due to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $47.9 million as well as an additional $5.3 million attributable to the inclusion of SVB Leerink in our financial results, partially offset by net capital distributions of $51.0 million primarily to investors in our managed funds of funds for the year ended December 31, 2019. For more information, refer to Note 2—“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Note 22. Deconsolidation of RBH: As discussed in Note 18. Contingencies, following the March 1, 2019, judgment of the Court of Appeal of Québec in two class action lawsuits against PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. ("RBH"), PMI recorded in its consolidated results a pre-tax charge of $194 million, representing $142 million net of tax, in the first quarter of 2019. This pre-tax Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense was included in marketing, administration and research costs on PMI's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019. The charge reflects PMI's assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment. RBH's share of the deposit is approximately CAD 257 million. On March 22, 2019, RBH obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ("CCAA"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees. The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH. As a result, PMI has determined that it no longer has a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and PMI deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing. PMI has also determined that it does not exert "significant influence" over RBH as that term is defined in ASC 323 (Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures). Therefore, as of March 22, 2019, PMI accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readi...
