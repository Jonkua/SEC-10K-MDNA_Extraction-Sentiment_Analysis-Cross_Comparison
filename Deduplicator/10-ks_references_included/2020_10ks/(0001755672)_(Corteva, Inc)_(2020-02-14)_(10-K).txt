Cash used for financing activities
EID’s cash used for financing activities was $(2,855) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $(2,624) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was due to repayments of commercial paper and long-term debt, transfers of cash to DowDuPont in connection with the Internal Reorganization and Business Realignments in 2019, and a net decrease in contributions from Dow and DuPont, primarily for repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by proceeds received from the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc., and a decrease in distributions to Dow and DowDuPont which were used to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s dividend payments, and in 2018 to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s share repurchases.

See Note 2 - Related Party Transactions, to the EID Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The company's significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company's operating results and financial condition.

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts, including, but not limited to, receivable and inventory valuations, impairment of tangible and intangible assets, long-term employee benefit obligations, income taxes, environmental matters and litigation. Management's estimates are based on historical experience, facts and circumstances available at the time and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. The company reviews these matters and reflects changes in estimates as appropriate. Management believes that the following represent some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company's accounting policies which could have a material effect on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits
Accounting for employee benefit plans involves numerous assumptions and estimates. Discount rate and expected return on plan assets are two critical assumptions in measuring the cost and benefit obligation of the company's pension and OPEB plans. Management reviews these two key assumptions when plans are re-measured. These and other assumptions are updated periodically to reflect the actual experience and expectations on a plan specific basis as appropriate. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated on a plan by plan basis and to the extent that such differences exceed 10 percent of the greater of the plan's benefit obligation or the applicable plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants if all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive.

Substantially all of the company's benefit obligation for pensions and OPEB are attributable to the benefit plans in the U.S. In the U.S., the single equivalent discount rate is developed by matching the expected cash flow of the benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality fixed-income instruments provided by the plans' actuaries as of the measurement date. The company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For non-U.S. benefit plans, historically the company utilized prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date.

Within the U.S., the company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for significant asset classes with the aim of achieving a prudent balance between return and risk. Strategic asset allocations in other countries are selected in accordance with the laws and practices of those countries. Where appropriate, asset-liability studies are also taken into consideration. The long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. is based upon historical real returns (net of inflation) for the asset classes covered by the investment policy, expected performance, and projections of inflation and interest rates over the long-term period during which benefits are payable to plan participants. Consistent with prior years, the long-term expected return on plan assets in the U.S. reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the effect of the company's active management of the plan's assets. In connection with pension contributions of $2,900 million to its principal U.S. pension plan for the period of January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, an investment policy study was completed for the principal U.S. pension plan. The study resulted in new target asset allocations for the U.S. pension plan with resulting changes to the expected return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 8.00 percent for the Predecessor period to 6.25 percent for the Successor period in 2017.

In determining annual expense for the principal U.S. pension plan, the company uses a market-related value of assets rather than its fair value. Accordingly, there may be a lag in recognition of changes in market valuation. As a result, changes in the fair value of assets are not immediately reflected in the company's calculation of net periodic pension cost.  Generally, the market-related value of assets is calculated by averaging market returns over 36 months, however, as a result of the Merger, for the Successor periods, the market-related value of assets was calculated by averaging market returns from September 1, 2017 through the respective year ends.

The following table shows the market-related value and fair value of plan assets for the principal U.S. pension plan:

------------------------------ ----------------- ----------------- ----------------- - ---- - ----

(Dollars in billions) December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017
Market-related value of assets $ 16.4 $ 16.6 $ 16.6
Fair value of plan assets 16.6 15.7 16.7

For plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets.

The following table highlights the potential impact on the company's pre-tax earnings due to changes in certain key assumptions with respect to the company's pension and OPEB plans, based on assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019:

------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------- --------------------------- --- - --

Environmental Matters
Accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2019, the company had accrued obligations of $336 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $51 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. As remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, it is difficult to develop precise estimates of future site remediation costs. The company's estimates are based on a number of factors, including the complexity of the geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs") at multi-party sites and the number of and financial viability of other PRPs. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation and costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to $620 million above that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 3 - Recent Accounting Guidance, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Legal Contingencies
The company's results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company, including product liability claims, patent infringement and antitrust claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental torts. The company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, management considers many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims, the company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and the matter's current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Indemnification Assets
The company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by DuPont, Dow, and Chemours. The term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk.  Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of DuPont, Dow, and / or Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to indemnifications.

Income Taxes
The breadth of the company's operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating taxes the company will ultimately pay. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits in the normal course of business. The resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to the company's tax assets and tax liabilities. It is reasonably possible that changes to the company’s global unrecognized tax benefits could be significant; however, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of completion of audits and possible outcomes, a current estimate of the range of increases or decreases that may occur within the next twelve months cannot be made.

Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

At December 31, 2019, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $633 million, inclusive of a valuation allowance of $457 million. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.

Valuation of Assets and Impairment Considerations
The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company's valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates, operating margin estimates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Although the estimates are deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition, those estimates are inherently uncertain.

Assessment of the potential impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investments in nonconsolidated affiliates, and other assets is an integral part of the company's normal ongoing review of operations. Testing for potential impairment of these assets is significantly dependent on numerous assumptions and reflects management's best estimates at a particular point in time. The dynamic economic environment in which the company's segments operate, and key economic and business assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized. In addition, the company continually reviews its portfolio of assets to ensure they are achieving their greatest potential and are aligned with the company's growth strategy. Strategic decisions involving a particular group of assets may trigger an assessment of the recoverability of the related assets. Such an assessment could result in impairment losses.

The company performs its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business in which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. As a result of the Internal Reorganizations and Realignments, the company changed its reportable segments to seed and crop protection to reflect the manner in which the company's chief operating decision maker assesses performance and allocates resources.  The change in reportable segments resulted in changes to the company's reporting units for goodwill impairment testing to align with the level at which discrete financial information is available for review by management. The company’s reporting units include seed, crop protection and digital. In connection with the change in reportable segments and reporting units, goodwill was reassigned from the former agriculture reporting unit to the seed, crop protection and digital reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach.

For purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test, the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term commodity prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates, and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is required.

If additional quantitative testing is required, the reporting unit’s fair value is compared with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge, if any, is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The company determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the income approach or market approach.

Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. The company uses its internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and includes an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on its most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in the company’s forecasts. The company derives its discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to its reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The company uses discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in its internally developed forecasts. Discount rates used in the company’s reporting unit valuations ranged from 9.5% to 10.5%. Under the market approach, the company uses metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions for comparable companies.

Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods. The company’s assets and liabilities were measured at fair value as of the date of the Merger, and as a result, any declines in projected cash flows or increases in discount rates could have a material, negative impact on the fair value of the company's reporting units and assets and therefore result in an impairment.

As discussed above, in connection with the change in reportable segments and reporting units, the company performed a goodwill impairment analysis for the former agriculture reporting unit immediately prior to the realignment and the newly created reporting units immediately after the realignment. The impairment analysis was performed using a discounted cash flow model (a form of the income approach), utilizing Level 3 unobservable inputs or a market approach. The company’s significant estimates in this analysis include, but are not limited to, future cash flow projections, the weighted average cost of capital, the terminal growth rate, and the tax rate. The company’s estimates of future cash flows are based on current regulatory and economic climates, recent operating results, and planned business strategy.  The company believes the current assumptions and estimates utilized are both reasonable and appropriate. Based on the goodwill impairment analysis performed both immediately prior to and immediately subsequent to the realignment, the company concluded the fair value of the former agriculture reporting unit and the newly created reporting units exceeded their carrying value, and no goodwill impairment charge was necessary.

In the third quarter of 2019, and in connection with strategic product and portfolio reviews, the company determined that the fair value of certain intangible assets classified as developed technology, other intangible assets and IPR&D within the seed segment that primarily relate to heritage DAS intangibles previously acquired from Cooperativa Central de Pesquisa Agrícola's ("Coodetec") was less than the carrying value due to the company’s focus on advancing more competitive products and eliminating redundancy and complexity across the breeding programs. As a result, the company recorded a pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $54 million ($41 million after-tax). The key assumptions used in determining the fair value of these intangibles involve management judgment and estimates relating to future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual cash flows.  Refer to Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Note 23 - Fair Value Measurements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, quantitative testing was performed on all of the company’s reporting units. Based on the results of the quantitative testing, the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values. For the seed reporting unit, the excess fair value over carrying value is approximately 12%, and therefore carries a higher risk of impairment charges in future periods. The dynamic economic environments in which the company's diversified product lines operate, and key economic and product line assumptions with respect to projected selling prices, product mix, market growth and inflation rates, can significantly affect the outcome of impairment tests. Estimates based on these assumptions may differ significantly from actual results. Changes in factors, circumstances and assumptions used in assessing potential impairments can have a significant impact on the existence and magnitude of impairments, as well as the time in which such impairments are recognized.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company also performed an impairment test on indefinite-lived intangibles and determined that the fair value of certain IPR&D assets had declined as a result of the company’s decision to accelerate the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands over the next five years with minimal use of the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® traits thereafter for the remaining term of the non-exclusive license with the Monsanto Company. This resulted in the company concluding that the recoverability of certain IPR&D projects associated with Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® were impaired, resulting in a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $90 million ($69 million after-tax). Refer to Note 7 - Restructuring and Asset Related Charges - Net, Note 15 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and Note 23 - Fair Value Measurements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

The company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for the seed reporting unit at December 31, 2019 is shown below (in millions):

-------------- -------- ---------------------------------- - -----

Reporting Unit Goodwill Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Seed $ 5,417 $ 1,881

Prepaid Royalties
The company’s seed segment currently has certain third-party biotechnology trait license agreements, which require up-front and variable payments subject to the licensor meeting certain conditions. These payments are reflected as other current assets and other assets and are amortized to cost of goods sold as seeds containing the respective trait technology are utilized over the term of the license. The rate of royalty amortization expense recognized is based on the company’s strategic plans which include various assumptions and estimates including product portfolio, market dynamics, farmer preferences, growth rates and projected planted acres. Changes in factors and assumptions included in the strategic plans, including potential changes to the product portfolio in favor of internally developed biotechnology, could impact the rate of recognition of the relevant prepaid royalty.

At December 31, 2019, the balance of prepaid royalties reflected in other current assets and other assets was $440 million and $794 million, respectively. The majority of the balance of prepaid royalties relates to the company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc.’s (“Pioneer”) non-exclusive license in the United States and Canada for the Monsanto Company's Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® glyphosate tolerance trait and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans (“Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement”). The prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of up-front, fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in Pioneer’s soybean product mix. The company’s historical expectation has been that the technology licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the Pioneer® brand soybean through the term of the agreement. DAS and MS Technologies, L.L.C. jointly developed and own the Enlist E3TM herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2, 4-D choline in Enlist Duo® and Enlist One® herbicides, as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides. In connection with the validation of breeding plans and large-scale product development timelines, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company is accelerating the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands, including Pioneer® brands, over the next five years. During the ramp-up period, the company is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement (the “Transition Plan”). The rate of royalty expense is therefore expected to significantly increase through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty as fewer seeds containing the respective trait are expected to be utilized.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued

In connection with the departure from these traits in the company's product portfolio, beginning January 1, 2020 the company will present and disclose the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense as a component of restructuring and asset related charges - net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense will represent the difference between the rate of amortization based on the revised number of units expected to contain the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® trait technology and the per unit cash rate per the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement. The non-cash accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense estimated for 2020 is approximately $160 million, aggregating to approximately $500 million over the next five years.

Further changes in factors and assumptions associated with usage of the trait platform licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement, including the Transition Plan, could further impact the rate of recognition of the prepaid royalty and statement of operations presentation of the accelerated prepaid royalty amortization expense.

The company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy the contractual obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business.

Long-term Employee Benefits
The company has various obligations to its employees and retirees. The company maintains retirement-related programs in many countries that have a long-term impact on the company's earnings and cash flows. These plans are typically defined benefit pension plans, as well as medical, dental and life insurance benefits for pensioners and survivors and disability benefits for employees (other post employment benefits or OPEB plans). Substantially all of the company's worldwide benefit obligation for pensions and essentially all of the company's worldwide OPEB obligations are attributable to the U.S. benefit plans.

Pension coverage for employees of the company's non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. The company regularly explores alternative solutions to meet its global pension obligations in the most cost effective manner possible as demographics, life expectancy and country-specific pension funding rules change. Where permitted by applicable law, the company reserves the right to change, modify or discontinue its plans that provide pension, medical, dental, life insurance and disability benefits.

Benefits under defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' pay near retirement. In November 2016, the company announced changes to the U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for active employees who participate in the U.S. pension plans on November 30, 2018. Therefore, as of November 30, 2018, active employees participating in the U.S. pension plans will not accrue additional benefits for future service and eligible compensation received. In addition to the changes to the U.S. pension plans, OPEB eligible employees who will be under the age of 50 as of November 30, 2018 will not receive post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance benefits. The majority of employees hired in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2007 are not eligible to participate in the pension and post-retirement medical, dental and life insurance plans, but receive benefits in the defined contribution plans.

Pension benefits are paid primarily from trust funds established to comply with applicable laws and regulations. The actuarial assumptions and procedures utilized are reviewed periodically by the plans' actuaries to provide reasonable assurance that there will be adequate funds for the payment of benefits. The company did not make contributions to the principal U.S. pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Funding for each pension plan other than the principal U.S. pension plan is governed by the rules of the sovereign country in which it operates. Thus, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between pension funding and pension expense. In general, however, improvements in plans' funded status tends to moderate subsequent funding needs. The company contributed $39 million, $103 million, $34 million and $67 million to its funded pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2019, the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively.

U.S. pension benefits that exceed federal limitations are covered by separate unfunded plans and these benefits are paid to pensioners and survivors from operating cash flows. The company's remaining pension plans with no plan assets are paid from operating cash flows. The company made benefit payments of $82 million, $111 million, $35 million and $57 million to its unfunded plans for the year ended December 31, 2019, the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively.

The company's OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $202 million, $216 million, $59 million and $166 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.

In 2020, the company expects to contribute approximately $60 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, and about $240 million for its OPEB plans. The company is evaluating potential discretionary contributions in 2020 to the principal U.S. pension plan, that could reduce a portion of the underfunded benefit obligation. Any discretionary contributions depend on various factors including market conditions and tax deductible limits.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued

The company's income can be significantly affected by pension and defined contribution benefits as well as OPEB costs. The following table summarizes the extent to which the company's loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017 was affected by pre-tax charges related to long-term employee benefits:

 Successor Predecessor
 For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 For the Period September 1 through December 31, 2017 For the Period January 1 through August 31, 2017
(Dollars in millions)
Net periodic benefit (credit) cost - pension and OPEB $ (163 ) $ (186 ) $ (71 ) $ 349
Defined contributions 115 117 41 55
Long-term employee benefit plan (credit) charges - continuing operations $ (48 ) $ (69 ) $ (30 ) $ 404

The above (credit) charges for pension and OPEB are determined as of the beginning of each period. Long-term employee credits were $(48) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $(69) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change is due to decrease in expected return on plan assets.

Activities for the period ended December 31, 2018 and for the period September 1 through December 31, 2017 benefited from the absence of the amortization of net losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss.  See "Pension Plans and Other Post Employment Benefits" under the Critical Accounting Estimates section beginning on page 65 of this report for additional information on determining annual expense.

For 2020, long-term employee benefits credit from continuing operations is expected to increase by about $180 million. The increase is mainly due to lower interest cost.

Environmental Matters
The company operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. Such rules are subject to change by the implementing governmental agency, and the company monitors these changes closely. Company policy requires that all operations fully meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, the company implements voluntary programs to reduce air emissions, minimize the generation of hazardous waste, decrease the volume of water use and discharges, increase the efficiency of energy use and reduce the generation of persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic materials. Management has noted a global upward trend in the amount and complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.

Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below:

------------------------------- ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------ --- -- -- - ---

 Successor Predecessor
(Dollars in millions) For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 For the Period September 1 through December 31, 2017 For the Period January 1 through August 31, 2017
Environmental operating costs $ 136 $ 142 $ 51 $ 67
Environmental remediation costs 29 48 16 51
 $ 165 $ 190 $ 67 $ 118

About 85 percent of total pre-tax environmental operating costs charged to income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental operating costs charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.

Environmental Operating Costs
As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials.

Remediation Accrual
Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:

------------------------------------- --- ---

(Dollars in millions)
Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 457
Remediation payments (55 )
Net increase in remediation accrual 1 48
Net change, indemnification 2 (52 )

Remediation payments (49 )
Net increase in remediation accrual 1 29
Net change, indemnification 2 (42 )
Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 336

-- ---------------------------------------------
1. Excludes indemnified remediation obligations.

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from EID's accrued remediation liabilities of obligations that have been fully transferred to Chemours and DuPont. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and the Corteva Separation Agreement, as discussed in Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, and Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, EID is indemnified by Chemours and DuPont for certain environmental matters.

Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs, and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to $620 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2019. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company.

The above noted $336 million accrued obligations includes the following:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---------------- ---------------------------------------- - --- - ---

2. The company has recorded an indemnification asset related to these accruals, including $30 million related to the Superfund sites.

-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Accrual balance represents management’s best estimate of the costs of remediation and restoration, although it is reasonably possible that the potential exposure, as indicated, could range above the amounts accrued, as there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates.

Part II

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, continued

As of December 31, 2019, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("Superfund") or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 140 sites for which the company does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at 70 of the 500 sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at approximately 210 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in "de minimis buyouts" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. The company received notice of potential liability at 2 new sites during 2018 compared with 3 notices in 2017. There were no new notices in 2019.

Environmental Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were approximately $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $8 million in 2020.

Climate Change
The company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities. The Board of Directors maintains oversight of these risks and opportunities. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues.

The company completed a non-financial materiality assessment and identified short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities. The results of this assessment are integrated into the company’s businesses, strategy and financial planning.

Continuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and market-based approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.

Extreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on customers’ ability to use its products, potentially reducing sales volumes, revenues and margins. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture and mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather.

Corteva is working to shrink its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses. The company is seeking ways to reduce its impact and providing tools and incentives for customers to do the same. Corteva champions climate positive agriculture, utilizing carbon storage and other means to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits without sacrificing farmer productivity or ongoing profitability. The company is developing metrics and targets that will be used to assess and manage material and relevant climate-related risks and opportunities.

The company is committed to engaging with multiple stakeholders and partners around the globe who have innovative and actionable ideas to help safeguard the health and well-being of the planet and its people. The company integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its overall risk management. By doing more to address climate change today, the company is fortifying its ability to grow food, grow progress and build a sustainable industry that will help humanity thrive for generations to come.

Cash used for financing activities
EID’s cash used for financing activities was $(2,855) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $(2,624) million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The change was due to repayments of commercial paper and long-term debt, transfers of cash to DowDuPont in connection with the Internal Reorganization and Business Realignments in 2019, and a net decrease in contributions from Dow and DuPont, primarily for repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by proceeds received from the related party loan between EID and Corteva, Inc., and a decrease in distributions to Dow and DowDuPont which were used to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s dividend payments, and in 2018 to fund a portion of DowDuPont’s share repurchases.

['s current status. Considerable judgment is required in determining whether to establish a litigation accrual when an adverse judgment is rendered against the company in a court proceeding. In such situations, the company will not recognize a loss if, based upon a thorough review of all relevant facts and information, management believes that it is probable that the pending judgment will be successfully overturned on appeal. A detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Indemnification Assets
The company has entered into various agreements where the company is indemnified for certain liabilities by DuPont, Dow, and Chemours. The term of this indemnification is generally indefinite and includes defense costs and expenses, as well as monetary and non-monetary settlements and judgments. In connection with the recognition of liabilities related to these matters, the company records an indemnification asset when recovery is deemed probable. In assessing the probability of recovery, the company considers the contractual rights under the separation agreements and any potential credit risk.  Future events, such as potential disputes related to recovery as well as the solvency of DuPont, Dow, and / or Chemours, could cause the indemnification assets to have a lower value than anticipated and recorded. The company evaluates the recovery of the indemnification assets recorded when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See Note 5 - Divestitures and Other Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to indemnifications.

['s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. For example, changes in facts and circumstances that alter the probability that the company will realize deferred tax assets could result in recording a valuation allowance, thereby reducing the deferred tax asset and generating a deferred tax expense in the relevant period. In some situations, these changes could be material. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

At December 31, 2019, the company had a net deferred tax liability balance of $633 million, inclusive of a valuation allowance of $457 million. Realization of deferred tax assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time. As a result, changes in tax laws, assumptions with respect to future taxable income, and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to deferred tax assets. See Note 10 - Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the deferred tax liability balance.

Valuation of Assets and Impairment Considerations
The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. The determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment, including estimates based on historical information, current market data and future expectations. The principal assumptions utilized in the company']:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us, such as reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and adopting a territorial tax system. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 22.2%. This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income,...

The company measures the service and interest cost components utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For non-U.S. benefit plans, historically the company utilized prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices to determine the discount rate, applicable to each country, at the measurement date.

['s Genuity® Roundup Ready 2 Yield® glyphosate tolerance trait and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® glyphosate and dicamba tolerance trait for soybeans (“Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement”). The prepaid royalty asset relates to a series of up-front, fixed and variable royalty payments to utilize the traits in Pioneer’s soybean product mix. The company’s historical expectation has been that the technology licensed under the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement would be used as the primary herbicide tolerance trait platform in the Pioneer® brand soybean through the term of the agreement. DAS and MS Technologies, L.L.C. jointly developed and own the Enlist E3TM herbicide tolerance trait for soybeans which provides tolerance to 2, 4-D choline in Enlist Duo® and Enlist One® herbicides, as well as glyphosate and glufosinate herbicides. In connection with the validation of breeding plans and large-scale product development timelines, during the fourth quarter of 2019, the company is accelerating the ramp up of the Enlist E3TM trait platform in the company’s soybean portfolio mix across all brands, including Pioneer® brands, over the next five years. During the ramp-up period, the company is expected to significantly reduce the volume of products with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield® and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend® herbicide tolerance traits beginning in 2021, with expected minimal use of the trait platform thereafter for the remainder of the Roundup Ready 2 License Agreement (the “Transition Plan”). The rate of royalty expense is therefore expected to significantly increase through higher amortization of the prepaid royalty as fewer seeds containing the respective trait are expected to be utilized.

['s OPEB plans are unfunded and the cost of the approved claims is paid from operating cash flows. Pre-tax cash requirements to cover actual net claims costs and related administrative expenses were $202 million, $216 million, $59 million and $166 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, the year ended December 31, 2018, the period September 1 through December 31, 2017, and the period January 1 through August 31, 2017, respectively. Changes in cash requirements reflect the net impact of higher per capita health care costs, demographic changes, plan amendments and changes in participant premiums, co-pays and deductibles.

In 2020, the company expects to contribute approximately $60 million to its pension plans other than the principal U.S. pension plan, and about $240 million for its OPEB plans. The company is evaluating potential discretionary contributions in 2020 to the principal U.S. pension plan, that could reduce a portion of the underfunded benefit obligation. Any discretionary contributions depend on various factors including market conditions and tax deductible limits.
