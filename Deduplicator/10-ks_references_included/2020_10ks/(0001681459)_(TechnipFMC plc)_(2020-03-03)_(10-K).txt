ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
We are a global leader in energy projects, technologies, systems and services. We have manufacturing operations worldwide, strategically located to facilitate efficient delivery of these products, technologies, systems and services to our customers. We report our results of operations in the following segments: Subsea, Onshore/Offshore and Surface Technologies. Management’s determination of the Company’s reporting segments was made on the basis of our strategic priorities and corresponds to the manner in which our Chief Executive Officer reviews and evaluates operating performance to make decisions about resource allocations to each segment.
A description of our products and services and annual financial data for each segment can be found in Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We focus on economic- and industry-specific drivers and key risk factors affecting our business segments as we formulate our strategic plans and make decisions related to allocating capital and human resources. The results of our segments are primarily driven by changes in capital spending by oil and gas companies, which largely depend upon current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas demand, production volumes, and consequently, commodity prices. We use crude oil and natural gas prices as an indicator of demand. Additionally, we use both onshore and offshore rig count as an indicator of demand, which consequently influences the level of worldwide production activity and spending decisions. We also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for capital allocation. These factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook, product obsolescence and the competitive environment. We address these risks in our business strategies, which incorporate continuing development of leading edge technologies and cultivating strong customer relationships.
Our Subsea segment is affected by changes in commodity prices and trends in deepwater oil and natural gas production. Our Onshore/Offshore segment is impacted by change in commodity prices, population growth and demand for natural gas, although the onshore market is typically more resilient to these changes impacting the segment. Our Subsea and Onshore/Offshore segments both benefit from the current market fundamentals supporting the demand for new liquefied natural gas facilities. Onshore/Offshore also benefits from the construction of petrochemical and fertilizer plants.
Our Surface Technologies segment is primarily affected by changes in commodity prices and trends in land-based and shallow water oil and natural gas production. We have developed close working relationships with our customers. Our results reflect our ability to build long-term alliances with oil and natural gas companies and to provide solutions for their needs in a timely and cost-effective manner. We believe that by closely working with our customers, we enhance our competitive advantage, improve our operating results and strengthen our market positions.
As we evaluate our operating results, we consider business segment performance indicators like segment revenue, operating profit and capital employed, in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog. A significant proportion of our revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting. Cash receipts from such arrangements typically occur at milestones achieved under stated contract terms. Consequently, the timing of revenue recognition is not always correlated with the timing of customer payments. We aim to structure our contracts to receive advance payments that we typically use to fund engineering efforts and inventory purchases. Working capital (excluding cash) and net (debt) cash are therefore key performance indicators of cash flows.
In each of our segments, we serve customers from around the world. During 2019, approximately 78 percent of our total sales were recognized outside of the United States. We evaluate international markets and pursue opportunities that fit our technological capabilities and strategies.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK
Overall Outlook - The price of crude oil remains volatile but continued to trade throughout 2019 well above the cyclical trough experienced in early 2016. The continued sustainability of the price recovery and business activity levels is dependent on several variables, including geopolitical stability, OPEC’s actions to regulate its production capacity, changes in demand patterns, and international sanctions and tariffs. However, as long-term demand is

forecast to rise and base production continues to naturally decline, we believe the macroeconomic backdrop will provide our customers with greater confidence to increase their investments in new sources of oil and natural gas production. We continue to believe that offshore and deepwater developments will remain a significant part of our customers’ portfolios in the long-term.
Subsea - The impact of the low crude oil price environment has led many of our customers to reduce their capital spending plans and defer new offshore projects. In response to these actions, we have lowered our cost base through reductions in workforce as well as in manufacturing. This has helped align our operations with the lower activity levels in order to mitigate some of the negative impact to our operating profit. We have taken additional actions in 2019, but we have balanced further reductions with the need to preserve our capacity in order to deliver current projects in backlog and ensure we are prepared for increased market activity and higher order inbound as industry activity moves higher.
Continued rationalization of our global footprint will  further leverage the benefits of our integrated offering, providing us with the ability to respond to increased order activity despite reductions in both personnel and manufacturing capacity. These actions are particularly important as the subsea industry continues to have both underutilized manufacturing and vessel capacity, which may lead to continued pricing pressure throughout 2020. We also recognize the need to further develop and invest in our people to ensure we have the core competencies and capabilities necessary for continued success.
Our lowered cost base combined with the aggressive cost reductions taken by our customers has led to an improvement in project economics. Many current and future offshore projects are deemed to be economic at prices below those experienced in 2019. We continue to work closely with our customers through early engagement in iFEED™ and the use of iEPCI™ to allow more project final investment decisions through the cycle. iEPCI™ can support clients’ initiatives to improve subsea project economics by helping to reduce cost and accelerate time to first oil. Our integrated commercial model now accounts for a significant portion of our business and going forward will serve as our standard approach to new business.
Onshore/Offshore - Onshore market activity continues to provide a tangible set of opportunities, particularly for natural gas monetization projects, as natural gas and renewables continue to take a larger share of global energy demand. Despite more recent softness in the spot price for LNG, the long-term outlook continues to remain strong, given the role of natural gas as a critical energy transition fuel. The market experienced a record level of new capacity final investment decisions in 2019, significantly benefitting our Company. We are confident that new LNG investments will continue in the near and intermediate term.
As an industry leader, we are well positioned for the growth in new liquefaction and regasification capacity as well as opportunities in biofuels, green chemistry, and other energy alternatives. We are actively engaged in several LNG FEED studies across multiple geographies. These FEED studies provide a platform for early engagement with clients and can significantly de-risk project execution while also supporting our pursuit of the EPC contract. Additionally, we continue to selectively pursue refining, petrochemical, fertilizer and renewables project opportunities in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and North American markets.
Offshore market activity is expected to benefit in the near-term as macro conditions continue to support the international growth cycle, resulting in increased activity in offshore and deepwater exploration and development. Recent discoveries of offshore fields with reserves in regions such as Brazil, Australia, and East Africa are expected to become drivers of increased investment. In the long-term, gas is expected to become a bigger portion of the global energy mix, requiring new investments in the upstream industry.
Surface Technologies - North American activity continued to decline in the fourth quarter of 2019 in both drilling and completions-related activities impacted negatively volume and prices. Operators have adjusted their spending downward. In that context, we took actions to reduce inventory levels, and our cost structure in terms of workforce and facility capacity. These actions will extend into 2020.
We believe that initiatives launched to propose new commercial offerings will drive market share gain and give us access to new markets which will help us to improve volume and margins.
Activity outside North America is resilient and has continued to increase in fourth quarter. We expect that activity to continue to grow in 2020 for both onshore and shallow water offshore.

a) Merger transaction costs are incurred in the first half of 2019.

2019 Compared With 2018
Revenue
Revenue increased $856.2 million in 2019 compared to the prior-year period, primarily as a result of improved project activity. Subsea revenue increased year-over-year with higher project-related activity, including increased revenue from integrated project execution (iEPCI) and increased demand in subsea services. Onshore/Offshore revenue was stable as a decrease in revenues from projects progressing towards completion, primarily Yamal LNG, was largely offset by increased project activity in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. Surface Technologies revenue increased primarily as a result of improving order backlog from international markets, primarily in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions.
Gross profit
Gross profit (revenue less cost of sales) as a percentage of sales increased marginally to 18.3% in 2019 and 18.2% in the prior-year period. Strong project execution and completion of Yamal LNG milestones improved gross profits in Onshore/Offshore offset by lower gross profit due to a more competitively priced Subsea backlog and weaker demand in North America for Surface Technologies products and services due to a challenged shale market.

43

Selling, general and administrative expense
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $87.5 million year-over-year primarily as a result of increased corporate expense driven largely by accelerated IT spending as well as additional performance incentive compensation awards.
Impairment, restructuring and other expense
We incurred $2.5 billion of restructuring, impairment and other expenses in 2019, primarily driven by $2.0 billion of goodwill impairment and $495.4 million of long-lived asset impairment. See Note 20 for further details.
Separation costs
We have incurred $72.1 million associated with the preparation of the separation during 2019. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the planned transaction.
Merger transaction and integration costs
We incurred merger transaction and integration costs of $31.2 million during the first half of 2019, before the announcement of the planned separation transaction due to the continuation of the integration activities pertaining to combining the two legacy companies.
Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Merger.

Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net, primarily reflects foreign currency gains and losses, non-recurring expenses and results of disposals of assets. In 2019, we recognized $146.9 million of net foreign exchange losses, compared with $116.5 million of net foreign exchange loss in the prior year period, mainly due to the devaluation of the Angolan kwanza, for which there is no active forwards market, while in 2018 a $280 million legal provision was made.
Net interest expense
Net interest expense increased $90.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the change in the fair value of the redeemable financial liability. We revalued the mandatorily redeemable financial liability to reflect current expectations about the obligation and recognized a charge of $423.1 million. See Note 25 for further information regarding the fair value measurement assumptions of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability and related changes in its fair value. Net interest expense in 2019, excluding the fair value measurement of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability, decreased by $10.4 million on a net basis compared to 2018.
Provision for income taxes
Our income tax provisions for 2019 and 2018 reflected effective tax rates of (12.9)% and (28.4)%, respectively. The year-over-year change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of tax expense associated with movements in valuation allowances, the release of contingent tax accruals due to the favorable resolution of income tax audits, and a favorable change in actual country mix of earnings, offset in part by the impact of nondeductible goodwill impairments.

Our effective tax rate can fluctuate depending on our country mix of earnings, which may change based on changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate

2019 Compared With 2018
Subsea revenue increased $683.0 million year-over-year, primarily due to increased project revenue from iEPCI, particularly projects in Asia, the North Sea and the Mediterranean that progressed towards completion, partially offset by decreased activity in Australia. The increase of Subsea Services activity across the globe further added to the year-over-year growth in revenue.
Subsea operating loss improved primarily due to a more competitively priced backlog being executed. This operating loss included $1,798.6 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets compared to $1,784.2 million in 2018. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to these asset impairments.

2019 Compared With 2018
Onshore/Offshore revenue increased $148.1 million year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher activity Europe, Middle East, Africa and North American regions as well as our Process and Technology business. The increase was partially offset by lower activity on Yamal LNG as the project nears completion.
Operating profit year-over-year was favorably impacted by reduced costs, strong project execution and bonus achievements on Yamal LNG due to completion of key milestones ahead of schedule. Additionally, 2019 included $17.0 million in restructuring and other expenses.

Onshore/Offshore operating profit as a percentage of revenue increased to 15.3% compared to 13.5% in 2018.

(a) Due to the Merger, there were 11.5 months included in the year ended 2017 for legacy FMC Technologies. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2019 Compared With 2018
Surface Technologies revenue increased $25.1 million year-over-year primarily driven by increased activity in the Middle East & Asia Pacific markets primarily driven by increased demand for drilling & completion and pressure control equipment and services, offset by negative drilling and completions market activity in North America as customers curbed capital spending.
Surface Technologies operating profit as a percent of revenue decreased significantly year-over-year. The decrease was primarily due to a $704.2 million charge for impairment and restructuring and other charges, in particular related to goodwill. This compared to a $13.8 million charge in the prior year. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to these impairments. Operating profit was also negatively impacted by reduced demand for flowline, hydraulic fracturing services, wellhead systems and pressure control equipment in North America, partially offset by increased demand for products and services in the Middle East and Asia Pacific.
Surface Technologies operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to (40.6)% compared to 10.9% in 2018.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
In addition to financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we provide non-GAAP financial measures (as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) below.
Net income, excluding charges and credits, as well as measures derived from it (including diluted earnings (loss) per share, excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes, excluding charges and credits ("Adjusted Operating profit"); Depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, excluding charges and credits ("Adjusted EBITDA"); and net cash) are non-GAAP financial measures.
Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period, and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The following is a reconciliation of the most comparable financial measures under GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Most of our cash is managed centrally and flowed through centralized bank accounts controlled and maintained by TechnipFMC in the US and in other jurisdictions to best meet the liquidity needs of our global operations.
We expect to meet the continuing funding requirements of our global operations with cash generated by such operations, our commercial paper programs, and our existing revolving credit facility.
Net (Debt) Cash - Net (debt) cash, is a non-GAAP financial measure reflecting cash and cash equivalents, net of debt. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate our capital structure and financial leverage. We believe net debt, or net cash, is a meaningful financial measure that may assist investors in understanding our financial condition and recognizing underlying trends in our capital structure. Net (debt) cash should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash and cash equivalents as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity.
The following table provides a reconciliation of our cash and cash equivalents to net (debt) cash, utilizing details of classifications from our consolidated balance sheets.

------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ------ ---- ------ ---- -------- -------- - - ------ -

 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) 2019 2018 2017

Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (349.8 ) $ (1,197.4 ) $ 468.1

Working capital $ (82.2 ) $ (759.0 ) $ (725.2 )

Operating cash flows - During 2019, we generated $848.5 million in cash flows from operating activities as compared to $185.4 million consumed in 2018, resulting in a $1,033.9 million increase compared to 2018. 65.9% of the annual operating cash flow was generated in the fourth quarter, primarily due to timing differences on project milestones and vendor payments.
Investing cash flows - Investing activities used $419.8 million and $460.2 million of cash in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from repayment of advance to joint venture of $62.0 million, decrease in cash used for acquisitions, partially offset by increased capital expenditures and payment to acquire debt securities in 2019. In 2019, we purchased a deepwater dive support vessel, Deep Discoverer, that was subsequently funded through a sale-leaseback transaction.
Financing cash flows - Financing activities used $784.4 million and $444.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $339.6 million in cash required for financing activities was primarily due to increased settlement of mandatorily redeemable financial liability and decreased borrowings of commercial paper, partially offset by decreased purchases of treasury stock in 2019.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Under our commercial paper program, we have the ability to access up to $1.5 billion and €1.0 billion of financing through our commercial paper dealers. Our available capacity under our revolving credit facility is reduced by any outstanding commercial paper.

Committed credit available under our revolving credit facility provides the ability to issue our commercial paper obligations on a long-term basis. We had $1,967.0 million of commercial paper issued under our facilities at December 31, 2019. As we had both the ability and intent to refinance these obligations on a long-term basis, our commercial paper borrowings were classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019.
Our revolving credit facility contains customary covenants as defined by the credit facility agreement which includes a financial covenant requiring that our total capitalization ratio not exceed 60% at the end of any financial quarter. The facility agreement also contains covenants restricting our ability and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional liens and indebtedness, enter into asset sales, make certain investments. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility.
Refer to Note 16 and Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to our credit facility and our mandatorily redeemable liability, respectively.

Credit Risk Analysis
For the purposes of mitigating the effect of the changes in exchange rates, we hold derivative financial instruments.
Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the fair value of the instruments, including the values associated with counterparty risk. These values must also take into account our credit standing, thus including in the valuation of the derivative instrument and the value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract. Adjustments to our derivative assets and liabilities related to credit risk were not material for any period presented.
We use the income approach as the valuation technique to measure the fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments on a recurring basis. This approach calculates the present value of the future cash flow by measuring the change from the derivative contract rate and the published market indicative currency rate, multiplied by the contract notional values. Credit risk is then incorporated by reducing the derivative’s fair value in asset positions by the result of multiplying the present value of the portfolio by the counterparty’s published credit spread. Portfolios in a liability position are adjusted by the same calculation; however, a spread representing our credit spread is used. Our credit spread, and the credit spread of other counterparties not publicly available are approximated by using the spread of similar companies in the same industry, of similar size and with the same credit rating.
At this time, we have no credit-risk-related contingent features in our agreements with the financial institutions that would require us to post collateral for derivative positions in a liability position.
Additional information about credit risk is incorporated herein by reference to Note 24 and Note 25 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Liquidity Outlook
Historically, we have generated our liquidity and capital resources primarily through operations and, when needed, through our credit facility. We have $533.0 million of capacity available under our revolving credit facility that we expect to utilize if working capital needs temporarily increase. The volatility in credit, equity and commodity markets creates some uncertainty for our business. Any payment deferrals or discounts on pricing granted to clients in prior years may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in 2020 and beyond.
We project spending approximately $450 million in 2020 for capital expenditures. However, projected capital expenditures for 2020 do not include any contingent capital that may be needed to respond to a contract award.
During 2020, we expect to make contributions of approximately $6.9 million to our international pension plans, representing primarily the Netherlands and the U.K. pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon plan investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments and other economic factors. We update our pension estimates annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. Qualified Pension Plan and our U.S. Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plan in 2020.

(a) Our available debt is dependent upon our compliance with covenants, including negative covenants related to liens and our total capitalization ratio. Any violation of covenants or other events of default, which are not waived or cured, or changes in our credit rating could have a material impact on our ability to maintain our committed financing arrangements.

55

Due to our intent and ability to refinance commercial paper obligations on a long-term basis under our revolving credit facility and the variable interest rates associated with these debt instruments, only interest on our Senior Notes is included in the table. During 2019, we paid $109.4 million for interest charges, net of interest capitalized.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) We lease office space, manufacturing facilities and various types of manufacturing and data processing equipment. Leases of real estate generally provide for payment of property taxes, insurance and repairs by us. Substantially all of our leases are classified as operating leases. In addition, in 2014 we entered into construction and operating lease agreements to finance the construction of manufacturing and office facilities located in the USA. In January 2016, construction of the facilities was completed and the operating lease commenced. Upon expiration of the lease term in September 2021, we have the option to renew the lease, purchase the facilities or re-market the facilities on behalf of the lessor, including certain guarantees of residual value under the re-marketing option.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with our suppliers to purchase raw materials or services. These agreements include a requirement that our supplier provide products or services to our specifications and require us to make a firm purchase commitment to our supplier. As substantially all of these commitments are associated with purchases made to fulfill our customers’ orders, the costs associated with these agreements will ultimately be reflected in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d) We expect to contribute approximately $6.9 million to our international pension plans during 2020. Required contributions for future years depend on factors that cannot be determined at this time. Additionally, we expect to pay directly to beneficiaries approximately $13.3 million for international unfunded pension plan and $5.5 million for U.S. Non-Qualified unfunded pension plan during 2019.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(e) It is reasonably possible that $2.1 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits will be settled during 2020, and this amount is reflected in income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. Although unrecognized tax benefits are not contractual obligations, they are presented in this table because they represent demands on our liquidity.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(f) Other contractual obligations represents our share of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we obtained voting control interests in legal onshore/offshore contract entities which own and account for the design, engineering and construction of the Yamal LNG plant. Prior to the amendments of the contractual terms that provided us with voting interest control, we accounted for these entities under the equity method of accounting based on our previously held interests in each of these entities. A mandatorily redeemable financial liability of $174.8 million was recognized as of December 31, 2016 to account for the fair value of the non-controlling interests. During the year ended December 31, 2019 we revalued the liability to reflect current expectations about the obligation. Refer to Note 25 for further information regarding the fair value measurement assumptions of the mandatorily redeemable financial liability and related changes in its fair value.

OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

(a) As collateral for our performance on certain sales contracts or as part of our agreements with insurance companies, we are liable under letters of credit, surety bonds and other bank guarantees. Our ability to generate revenue from certain contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain these off-balance sheet financial instruments. These off-balance sheet financial instruments may be renewed, revised or released based on changes in the underlying commitment. Historically, our commercial commitments have not been drawn upon to a material extent; consequently, management believes it is not reasonably likely there will be material claims against these commitments. However, should these financial instruments become unavailable to us, our operations and liquidity could be negatively impacted.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented and the related disclosures in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe the following critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements address all important accounting areas where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of our significant accounting policies.

56

Revenue Recognition
The majority of our revenue is derived from long-term contracts that can span several years. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers. The unit of account in ASC Topic 606 is a performance obligation. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time.
A significant portion of our total revenue recognized over time relates to our Onshore/Offshore and Subsea segments, primarily for the entire range of onshore facilities, fixed and floating offshore oil and gas facilities, and subsea exploration and production equipment projects that involve the design, engineering, manufacturing, construction, and assembly of complex, customer-specific systems. Because of control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.
Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables, and requires significant judgment. It is common for our long-term contracts to contain award fees, incentive fees, or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification, the amount can be estimated reliably, and its realization is probable. The estimated amounts are included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.
We execute contracts with our customers that clearly describe the equipment, systems, and/or services. After analyzing the drawings and specifications of the contract requirements, our project engineers estimate total contract costs based on their experience with similar projects and then adjust these estimates for specific risks associated with each project, such as technical risks associated with a new design. Costs associated with specific risks are estimated by assessing the probability that conditions arising from these specific risks will affect our total cost to complete the project. After work on a project begins, assumptions that form the basis for our calculation of total project cost are examined on a regular basis and our estimates are updated to reflect the most current information and management’s best judgment.
Adjustments to estimates of contract revenue, total contract cost, or extent of progress toward completion are often required as work progresses under the contract and as experience is gained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. The nature of accounting for long-term contracts is such that refinements of the estimating process for changing conditions and new developments are continuous and characteristic of the process. Consequently, the amount of revenue recognized over time is sensitive to changes in our estimates of total contract costs. There are many factors, including, but not limited to, the ability to properly execute the engineering and design phases consistent with our customers’ expectations, the availability and costs of labor and material resources, productivity, and weather, all of which can affect the accuracy of our cost estimates, and ultimately, our future profitability.
Our operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 was positively impacted by approximately $1,114.3 million, as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized changes in our estimates that had an impact on our margin in the amounts of $797.2 million, $324.7 million and $(7.6) million in our Onshore/Offshore, Subsea and Surface Technologies segments, respectively. The changes in contract estimates are attributed to better than expected performance throughout our execution of our projects.

57

Our operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted by approximately $553.4 million, as a result of changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress at December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized changes in our estimates that had an impact on our margin in the amounts of $379.2 million, $169.9 million and $4.3 million in our Onshore/Offshore, Subsea and Surface technologies segments, respectively. The changes in contract estimates are attributed to better than expected performance throughout our execution of our projects.
Accounting for Income Taxes
Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management’s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United Kingdom and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense.
In determining our current income tax provision, we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. When we maintain deferred tax assets, we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. To the extent, we believe recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period, requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and finally, the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations.
Forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment. In estimating future income, we use our internal operating budgets and long-range planning projections. We develop our budgets and long-range projections based on recent results, trends, economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments’ performance, our backlog, planned timing of new product launches and customer sales commitments. Significant changes in our judgment related to the expected realizability of a deferred tax asset results in an adjustment to the associated valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2019, we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets where we believe it is not more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income sufficient to realize such assets.
The calculation of our income tax expense involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained on examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits. We adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of new information previously unavailable. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates. Any such differences will be reflected as adjustments to income tax expense in the periods in which they are determined.
Accounting for Pension and Other Post-retirement Benefit Plans
The determination of the projected benefit obligations of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are important to the recorded amounts of such obligations on our consolidated balance sheet and to the amount of pension expense in our consolidated statements of income. In order to measure the obligations and expense associated with our pension benefits, management must make a variety of estimates, including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs, rate of compensation increase, employee turnover rates, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. We update these estimates on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events. These accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty and difficulty in estimating these measures. Different estimates used by management could result in our recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time.
Due to the specialized and statistical nature of these calculations which attempt to anticipate future events, we engage third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the costs and obligations associated with these pension benefits. The discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are primarily based on investment yields available and the historical performance

58

of our plan assets, respectively. These measures are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management’s judgment and can materially affect net income.
The actuarial assumptions and estimates made by management in determining our pension benefit obligations may materially differ from actual results as a result of changing market and economic conditions and changes in plan participant assumptions. While we believe the assumptions and estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in plan participant assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets on pension expense and the projected benefit obligation:

Determination of Fair Value in Business Combinations
Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. The determination of fair value requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, and in making these determinations, management uses all available information. If necessary, we have up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finalize these fair value determinations. For tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, the determination of fair value utilizes several valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows which has assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenue and expenses associated with an asset. The assumptions made in performing these valuations include, but are not limited to, discount rates, future revenues and operating costs, projections of capital costs, and other assumptions believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage third-party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Business combinations are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets
Long-lived assets, including vessels, property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets being amortized and capitalized software costs are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future productivity of the asset, operating costs and capital decisions and all available information at the date of review. If future market conditions deteriorate beyond our current expectations and assumptions, impairments of long-lived assets may be identified if we conclude that the carrying amounts are no longer recoverable.

59

Impairment of Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but is tested for impairment on an annual basis at a reporting level unit, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We have established October 31 as the date of our annual test for impairment of goodwill. We identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we measure the impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. Reporting units with goodwill are tested for impairment using a quantitative impairment test.
When using the quantitative impairment test, determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted future cash flow model. The majority of the estimates and assumptions used in a discounted future cash flow model involve unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of a business. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.
A lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments. Factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines of the reporting unit’s products and services, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, changes in customer demand, and other changes in market conditions, which may affect certain market participant assumptions used in the discounted future cash flow model based on internal forecasts of revenues and expenses over a specified period plus a terminal value (the income approach). When assessing triggering factors, on a quarterly and also on an annual basis, we also analyze the relationship between our market capitalization and our consolidated book value of equity.
The income approach estimates fair value by discounting each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows using a weighted-average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions and the risk profile of the reporting unit. To arrive at our future cash flows, we use estimates of economic and market assumptions, including growth rates in revenues, costs, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins, tax rates and cash expenditures. Future revenues are also adjusted to match changes in our business strategy. We believe this approach is an appropriate valuation method. Under the market multiple approach, we determine the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting unit’s projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical calculations using either a one, two or three year average. Our reporting unit valuations were determined primarily by utilizing the income approach, with a lesser weighting attributed the market multiple approach.
Late in the fourth quarter of 2019, oil prices fell dramatically and our market capitalization declined significantly, together with other companies in the oil service industry. This event is not expected to have significant negative impact on our performance and it is not changing materially our medium-term and long-term cash flow projections.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $1,321.9 million and $666.8 million of goodwill impairment charges in our Subsea and Surface Technologies reporting units, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $1,383.0 million of goodwill impairment charges in our Subsea reporting unit. Refer to Note 20 to these consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
The fair value over carrying amount for our Onshore/Offshore reporting unit was in excess of 400% of its carrying amount.
The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of our reporting units at December 31, 2019:

---------------------------------------- --------------

 2019
Year of cash flows before terminal value 4
Discount rates 12.5% to 15.0%

OTHER MATTERS
On March 28, 2016, FMC Technologies received an inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") related to the DOJ's investigation of whether certain services Unaoil S.A.M. provided to its clients, including FMC Technologies, violated the FCPA. On March 29, 2016, Technip S.A. also received an inquiry from the DOJ related to Unaoil. We cooperated with the DOJ's investigations and, with regard to FMC Technologies, a related investigation by the SEC.
In late 2016, Technip S.A. was contacted by the DOJ regarding its investigation of offshore platform projects awarded between 2003 and 2007, performed in Brazil by a joint venture company in which Technip S.A. was a minority participant, and we have also raised with DOJ certain other projects performed by Technip S.A. subsidiaries in Brazil between 2002 and 2013. The DOJ has also inquired about projects in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea that were awarded to Technip S.A. subsidiaries in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation into potential violations of the FCPA in connection with these projects. We contacted and cooperated with the Brazilian authorities (Federal Prosecution Service (“MPF”), the Comptroller General of Brazil (“CGU”) and the Attorney General of Brazil (“AGU”)) with their investigation concerning the projects in Brazil and have also contacted and are cooperating with French authorities (the Parquet National Financier (“PNF”)) about these existing matters.
On June 25, 2019, we announced a global resolution to pay a total of $301.3 million to the DOJ, the SEC, the MPF, and the CGU/AGU to resolve these anti-corruption investigations. We will not be required to have a monitor and will, instead, provide reports on our anti-corruption program to the Brazilian and U.S. authorities for two and three years, respectively.
As part of this resolution, we entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ related to charges of conspiracy to violate the FCPA related to conduct in Brazil and with Unaoil. In addition, Technip USA, Inc., a U.S. subsidiary, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA related to conduct in Brazil. We will also provide the DOJ reports on our anti-corruption program during the term of the DPA.
In Brazil, our subsidiaries Technip Brasil - Engenharia, Instalações E Apoio Marítimo Ltda. and Flexibrás Tubos Flexíveis Ltda. entered into leniency agreements with both the MPF and the CGU/AGU. We have committed, as part of those agreements, to make certain enhancements to their compliance programs in Brazil during a two-year self-reporting period, which aligns with our commitment to cooperation and transparency with the compliance community in Brazil and globally.
In September 2019, the SEC approved our previously disclosed agreement in principle with the SEC Staff and issued an Administrative Order, pursuant to which we paid the SEC $5.1 million, which was included in the global resolution of $301.3 million.
To date, the investigation by PNF related to historical projects in Equatorial Guinea and Ghana has not reached resolution. We remain committed to finding a resolution with the PNF and will maintain a $70.0 million provision related to this investigation. As we continue to progress our discussions with PNF towards resolution, the amount of a settlement could exceed this provision.
There is no certainty that a settlement with PNF will be reached or that the settlement will not exceed current accruals. The PNF has a broad range of potential sanctions under anticorruption laws and regulations that it may seek to impose in appropriate circumstances including, but not limited to, fines, penalties, and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. Any of these measures, if applicable to us, as well as potential customer reaction to such measures, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we cannot reach a resolution with the PNF, we could be subject to criminal proceedings in France, the outcome of which cannot be predicted.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.
