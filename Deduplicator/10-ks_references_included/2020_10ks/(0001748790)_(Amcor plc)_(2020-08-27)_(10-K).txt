Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

        In February 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued guidance that requires the Company to disclose a description of the Company’s accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income and whether the Company elects to reclassify the stranded income tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("The Act"), along with information about other income tax effects that are reclassified. For all entities, the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities can choose whether to apply the amendments retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the Act is recognized or to apply the amendments in the period of adoption. This guidance was effective for the Company on July 1, 2019. The Company adopted the new guidance effective July 1, 2019 and did not elect the optional reclassification as the impact was not material.

        In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance which simplifies existing guidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the economic effects of risk management activities in the financial statements. For public business entities, the amendments in Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-12 were effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. This guidance was effective for the Company on July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach, with the exception of presentation and disclosure guidance which is adopted prospectively. Implementation of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

        In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that required lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to past accounting guidance. The guidance also eliminates the previous real estate-specific provisions and changes the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and lease executory costs for all entities. Lease classification will determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense. The Company adopted the new lease standard at July 1, 2019 using a simplified transition option that allows for a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption and therefore did not restate prior periods. The Company also elected to adopt the package of practical expedients which allows for existing operating leases to continue to be classified as operating leases under the new guidance without reassessing whether the contracts contain a lease under the new guidance or whether classification of the operating lease would be different under the new standard. The Company did not elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient but did adopt the practical expedient pertaining to land easements which provides the option not to reassess whether land easements not previously accounted for as leases under prior leasing guidance would be leases under the new guidance.

        Adoption of the new leasing standard resulted in the following impacts to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements as of the adoption date: the establishment of a lease liability of $590.5 million, including current portion, a corresponding right-of-use asset of $569.8 million, and the reclassification of approximately $58.2 million (net of tax) of deferred gains on sale leaseback transactions.

    The complete impact of the changes made to the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of the new leasing guidance were as follows:

($ in millions) June 30, 2019 Adjustments due to Adoption At July 1, 2019
----------------------------- ------------- --------------------------- ---------------
Operating lease assets — 569.8 569.8
Other current liabilities 1,044.9 54.3 1,099.2
Operating lease liabilities — 506.8 506.8
Deferred tax liabilities 1,011.7 18.7 1,030.4
Other non-current liabilities 241.0 (68.2) 172.8
Retained earnings 323.7 58.2 381.9

        Due to the adoption of the guidance using the simplified transition option, there are no changes to the Company's previously reported results prior to July 1, 2019. Lease expense is not expected to change materially as a result of adoption of the new guidance. The Company changed its disclosures related to leasing beginning in fiscal year 2020. Refer to Note 14, "Leases".

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

        In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires financial assets, or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected when finalized. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that will be deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This guidance affects loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance will be effective for the Company on July 1, 2020 and will be adopted using the modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect the standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

        In December 2019, the FASB issued updated guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and improving the consistent application of U.S. GAAP in other tax accounting areas. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods, and any interim periods within those annual periods, that begin after December 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the guidance will be effective for the Company on July 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

        In March 2020, the FASB issued optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform related to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or another reference rate expected to be discontinued, subject to meeting certain criteria. The Company is currently evaluating whether to elect the adoption of this optional guidance.

    The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB and SEC. The Company determined that all other ASUs not yet adopted to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements at this time.

 Acquisitions and Divestitures
Year ended June 30, 2019

Bemis Company, Inc.

        On June 11, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Bemis Company, Inc ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products based in the United States. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, dated as of August 6, 2018, each outstanding share of Bemis common stock that was issued and outstanding upon completion of the transaction was converted into the right to receive 5.1 ordinary shares of the Company traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

    The following table summarizes the fair value of consideration exchanged:

Bemis shares outstanding at June 11, 2019 (in millions) 91.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- -------
Share Exchange Ratio 5.1
Price per Share (Based on Amcor’s closing share price on June 11, 2019) $ 11.18
Total Equity Consideration $ 5,229.6

        The acquisition of Bemis positioned the Company as a global leader in consumer packaging with a comprehensive global footprint in flexible packaging and greater scale in key regions of North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, along with industry-leading research and development capabilities.

        The acquisition of Bemis was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with ASC 805, "Business Combinations," which required allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were finalized upon completion of the measurement period in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020. The allocation was subject to change within the measurement period, up to one year from the acquisition date, as additional information concerning final asset and liability valuations was obtained. The measurement period adjustments resulted in a $229.9 million increase to goodwill, which includes a $210.6 million decrease to property, plant and equipment, a $99.0 million decrease to finite lived intangible assets, a $184.1 million decrease to deferred tax liabilities, a $97.9 million increase in other non-current liabilities, along with other adjustments to assets held for sale and working capital.
    The following table summarizes the final allocation of the total purchase consideration to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.

Net identifiable assets acquired 1,862.0

    The following table details the identifiable intangible assets acquired from Bemis, their fair values and estimated useful lives:

----------------------------- -------------------------------------- ------- --
(in millions) (Years)
Customer relationships $ 1,650.0 15
Technology 110.0 7
Other 171.2 7
Total other intangible assets $ 1,931.2

        The allocation of the purchase price resulted in $3,367.6 million of goodwill for the Flexibles Segment, which is not tax deductible. The goodwill on acquisition represents the future economic benefit expected to arise from other intangible assets acquired that do not qualify for separate recognition, including assembled workforce and non-contractual relationships, as well as expected future synergies.

        The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows, appraisals and market comparables.
Divestitures

        Closing of the Bemis acquisition was conditional upon the receipt of regulatory approvals, approval by both Amcor and Bemis shareholders, and satisfaction of other customary conditions. In order to satisfy certain regulatory approvals, the Company was required to divest three of Bemis' medical packaging facilities located in the United Kingdom and Ireland ("EC Remedy") and three Amcor medical packaging facilities in the United States ("U.S. Remedy"). The U.S. Remedy was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and the Company received $214.2 million resulting in a gain of $159.1 million. The EC Remedy was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and the Company received $397.1 million and recorded a loss on the sale of $8.8 million which is the result of the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings from discontinued operations upon sale of the EC Remedy.

        In addition, the Company sold an equity method investment acquired through the Bemis acquisition in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 for proceeds of $27.7 million. There was no gain on sale as the investment was recorded at fair value upon acquisition.

 Discontinued Operations
        On February 11, 2019, the Company received approval from the European Commission ("EC") for the acquisition of Bemis. A condition of the approval was an agreement to divest three Bemis medical packaging facilities located in the United Kingdom and Ireland ("EC Remedy"). Upon completion of the Bemis acquisition on June 11, 2019, the Company determined that the EC Remedy met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation, in accordance with ASC 205-20, "Discontinued Operations." The sale of the EC Remedy closed on August 8, 2019. The Company recorded a loss on the sale of $8.8 million, which is the result of the reclassification of accumulated foreign currency translation amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings from discontinued operations upon sale of the EC Remedy.

        The assets and liabilities of the EC Remedy, which is within the Company's Flexibles Segment, are reflected as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2019. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are required to be recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.

        The following table summarizes the results of the EC Remedy, classified as discontinued operations, from June 11, 2019 until the sale of the EC Remedy on August 8, 2019:

 Restructuring Plans
2019 Bemis Integration Plan

        In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization. As previously announced, the Company continues to target realizing approximately $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general and administrative savings by the end of fiscal year 2022.

        The Company's total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan pre-tax integration costs are expected to be approximately $200 million. The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of restructuring and related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. The Company estimates that approximately $150 million of the $200 million total integration costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of which $54.1 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2022.

        Restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration costs are not linked to restructuring. The Company believes the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of our 2019 Bemis Integration Plan. The restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics and train new employees on relocated equipment.

2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan

        On August 21, 2018, the Company announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging ("2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan") aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint. The Plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost reductions.

        The Company's total 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $110 million with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing facilities and employee related costs. The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash impairments. The Company estimates that approximately $65 to $70 million of the $110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $23.6 million. The 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021.

2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan

        On June 9, 2016, the Company announced a major initiative ("2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles segment. This initiative was designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the cost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to market.

        As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, the Company has closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. The Company's total pre-tax restructuring costs were $230.8 million, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million of the $230.8 million total costs resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4 million. The Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2019.

Other Restructuring Plans

        The Company entered into other individually immaterial restructuring plans ("Other Restructuring Plans"). The Company's restructuring charge related to these Plans was approximately $17.9 million, $18.8 million and $25.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 Equity Method Investments
        Investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, with usually not more than 50% voting interest, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in investments in affiliated companies. Investments in affiliated companies as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 include an interest in AMVIG Holdings Limited ("AMVIG") of 47.6% and other individually immaterial investments.

        AMVIG is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Its quoted share price as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 was $0.18 (HKD 1.40) and $0.24 (HKD 1.85), respectively. The value of Amcor's investment in AMVIG based on its quoted share price as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 was $77.7 million and $104.8 million, respectively.

        During the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company received dividends of $9.8 million, $8.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively, from AMVIG.

        The Company reviews its investment in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Due to impairment indicators present in each of the years presented, the Company performed an impairment test by comparing the carrying value of its investment in AMVIG to its fair value, which was determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price. The fair value of the investment dropped below its carrying value during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, and therefore the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $25.6 million, $14.0 million and $36.5 million, respectively, to bring the value of its investment to fair value. The impairment charge was included in equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax, in the consolidated statement of income.

 Fair Value Measurements
    The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities listed below reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).

        The Company's non-derivative financial instruments primarily include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, short-term debt and long-term debt. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

        Fair value disclosures are classified based on the fair value hierarchy. See Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," for information about the Company's fair value hierarchy.

        The fair value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates its carrying value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt with fixed interest rates is based on market prices, if available, or expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for financial liabilities with similar risk profiles.

    The carrying values and estimated fair values of long-term debt with fixed interest rates (excluding finance leases) were as follows:

 June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------- -------------- ---------- - ------- - -------
 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value

Total long-term debt with fixed interest rates (excluding commercial paper and finance leases) $ 3,599.3 $ 3,793.1 $ 2,955.6 $ 3,041.3

Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

        Additionally, the Company measures and records certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments and contingent purchase consideration liabilities, at fair value.

        The following table summarizes the fair value of these instruments, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy:

Forward exchange contracts — 9.3 — 9.3
Interest rate swaps — — — —
Total liabilities measured at fair value $ — $ 13.9 $ 13.6 $ 27.5

    The fair value of the commodity contracts was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and observed market forward prices discounted at a currency-specific rate. Forward exchange contract fair values were determined based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets using inputs such as currency rates and forward points. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market-based swap yield curves, considering current interest rates.

    The fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities was determined for each arrangement individually. The fair value was determined using the income approach with significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include the discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement and probability adjusted financial projections. The expected outcomes are recorded at net present value, which requires adjustment over the life for changes in risks and probabilities.

    The following table sets forth a summary of changes in the value of the Company's Level 3 financial liabilities:

 June 30,
-------------------------------------------- -------- ----- ------ ---- - ----
(in millions) 2020 2019 2018
Fair value at the beginning of the year $ 13.6 $ 14.6 $ 27.6
Additions due to acquisitions — — —
Changes in fair value of Level 3 liabilities 1.1 — 0.8
Payments — (1.0) (13.0)
Foreign currency translation 0.1 — (0.8)
Fair value at the end of the year $ 14.8 $ 13.6 $ 14.6

        The fair value of contingent purchase consideration liabilities is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. The change in fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities, which was included in other income, net is due to the passage of time and changes in the probability of achievement used to develop the estimate.

Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

        In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required by U.S. GAAP. The Company measures certain assets, including the Company’s equity method investments, technology intangible assets, other intangible assets and goodwill at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. The fair values of these assets are determined, when applicable, based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.

    The Company tests for impairment of its equity method investments when impairment indicators are present. Impairment tests were performed by comparing the carrying value of the Company’s investment in AMVIG at the end of each
period, including interim periods, to the fair value of the investment, which was determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price which is classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

        Based on the Company’s evaluation of AMVIG’s current financial condition and the Company’s intent and ability to hold its investment in AMVIG to recover the carrying value, the Company concluded that the decline in fair value was temporary at March 31, 2020, and therefore no impairment was recorded. However, the quoted share price did not recover in the fiscal fourth quarter and the Company determined that the investment was impaired as of June 30, 2020 and recorded an impairment charge of $25.6 million. The Company also recorded impairment charges of our AMVIG investment of $14.0 million in fiscal year 2019 and $36.5 million in fiscal year 2018.

        The Company tests indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. The Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $31.1 million in the fiscal year 2019 to reduce the carrying value of an indefinite-lived technology intangible asset to its fair value. During fiscal year 2020 and 2018, there were no indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges recorded.
 The carrying values and estimated fair values of long-term debt with fixed interest rates (excluding finance leases) were as follows:

 Derivative Instruments
        The Company periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rates, commodity and currency risks. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria, the Company, at inception, formally designates and documents the instrument as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge of a specific underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses and documents that its hedges have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective.

Interest Rate Risk

        The Company's policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates and, where appropriate, hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and interest rate locks.

        For interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in interest expense. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated statement of income under other non-operating income (loss), net.

        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of the Company's receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps was $837.1 million and $841.1 million, respectively.

        At June 30, 2020, the Company had a notional amount of $100 million (equivalent to €89.0 million) cross-currency interest rate swaps outstanding. The Company did not designate the swaps as a hedging instrument and thus changes in fair value were immediately recognized in earnings.

        During the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into six Treasury lock agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to the highly probable issuance of long-term debt. The total notional amount of the Treasury lock of $250.0 million was designated as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction and deemed these agreements to be highly effective.

        The associated unsecured senior note was issued on June 19, 2020, and the Company has settled these Treasury lock agreements with a $19.8 million cash payment to the counterparties. The loss associated with the settlement was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the unsecured senior notes, which is 10 years.

Foreign Currency Risk

        The Company manufactures and sells its products and finances operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.

    To manage this exchange rate risk, the Company utilizes forward contracts. Contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging relationship in the same consolidated statement of income line item as the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.

        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts was $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.

        The Company manages its currency exposure related to the net assets of its foreign operations primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant currency. Foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement of external borrowings designated as net investment hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in AOCI, to the extent that the hedge is effective. The ineffective portion is immediately recognized in other non-operating income (loss), net in the consolidated
statement of income. When a hedged net investment is disposed of, a percentage of the cumulative amount recognized in AOCI in relation to the hedged net investment is recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.

        At the beginning of fiscal year 2020, the carrying value of commercial paper issued which is designated as a net investment hedge was $67.0 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, the Company settled $67.0 million of U.S. commercial paper issued by a non-U.S. entity, which was previously designated as a net investment hedge in its U.S. subsidiaries. The net investment hedges recorded through the point of settlement are included in AOCI and will be reclassified into earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the related subsidiaries. The Company did not have any net investment hedges in place as of June 30, 2020.

Commodity Risk

        Certain raw materials used in the Company's production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. The Company's policy is to minimize exposure to price volatility by passing through the commodity price risk to customers, including the use of fixed price swaps. The Company purchases on behalf of customers fixed price commodity swaps to offset the exposure of price volatility on the underlying sales contracts, these instruments are cash closed out on maturity and the related cost or benefit is passed through to customers. Information about commodity price exposure is derived from supply forecasts submitted by customers and these exposures are hedged by a central treasury unit. Changes in the fair value of commodity hedges are recognized in AOCI. The cumulative amount of the hedge is recognized in the consolidated statement of income when the forecast transaction is realized.

        At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had the following outstanding commodity contracts that were entered into to hedge forecasted purchases:

        In addition to the fair value associated with derivative instruments noted in the table above, the Company had a carrying value of $67.0 million associated with non-derivative instruments designated as foreign currency net investment hedges as of June 30, 2019. The designated foreign currency-denominated debt was included in long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet. There are no currency net investment hedges as of June 30, 2020.

    Certain derivative financial instruments are subject to netting arrangements and are eligible for offset. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to offset the fair values of these instruments within the consolidated balance sheets.

        Where funded, the Company and, in some countries, the employees make cash contributions into the pension fund. In the case of unfunded plans, the Company is responsible for benefit payments as they fall due. Plan funding requirements are generally determined by local regulation and/or best practice and differ between countries. The local statutory funding positions are not necessarily consistent with the funded status disclosed on the consolidated balance sheet. For any funded plans in deficit (as measured under local country guidelines), the Company agrees with the trustees and plan fiduciaries to undertake suitable funding programs to provide additional contributions over time in accordance with local country requirements. Contributions to the Company's defined benefit pension plans, not including unfunded plans, are expected to be $24.2 million over the next fiscal year.

        The following benefit payments for the succeeding five fiscal years and thereafter, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

        The ERISA Benefit Plan Committee in the United States, the Pension Plan Committee in Switzerland and the Trustees of the pension plans in Canada, Ireland and UK establish investment policies and strategies for the Company's pension plan assets and are required to consult with the Company on changes to their investment policy. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date, the Company considers the plan assets' historical returns, asset allocations, and the anticipated future economic environment and long-term performance of the asset classes. While appropriate consideration is given to recent and historical investment performance, the assumption represents management's best estimate of the long-term prospective return.

    The pension plan assets measured at fair value were as follows:

Equity securities: Valued at the closing prices reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.

Government debt securities: Valued using the pricing of similar agency issues, live trading feeds from several vendors and benchmark yield.

Corporate debt securities: Valued using market inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications. Inputs may be prioritized differently at certain times based on market conditions.

Real estate: Valued at the closing prices reported in the active market in which the listed real estate funds are traded.

Cash and cash equivalents: Consist of cash on deposit with brokers and short-term money market funds and are shown net of receivables and payables for securities traded at period end but not yet settled. All cash and cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

Other:

Level 1: Mutual funds. A daily asset value is available for these assets.

Level 2: Assets held in diversified growth funds, pooled funds, financing funds and derivatives, where the value of the assets are determined by the investment managers or an external valuer based on the probable value of the underlying assets.

Level 3: Indemnified plan assets and a buy-in policy, insurance contacts and pooled funds (equity, credit, macro-orientated, multi-strategy, cash and other). The value of indemnified plan assets and the buy-in policy are determined based on the value of the liabilities that the assets cover. The value of insurance contracts is determined by the insurer based on the value of the insurance policies. The value of the pooled funds is calculated by the investment managers based on the values of the underlying portfolios.

Forward contracts to purchase own shares

    The Company's employee share plans require the delivery of shares to employees in the future when rights vest or vested options are exercised. The Company currently acquires shares on the open market to deliver shares to employees to satisfy vesting or exercising commitments. This exposes the Company to market price risk.

        To manage the market price risk, the Company has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares. As of June 30, 2020, the Company has entered into forward contracts that mature in June 2021 to purchase 2.0 million shares at an average price of $10.68. As of June 30, 2019, the Company had outstanding forward contracts for 1.0 million shares at a price of $11.00 that matured in June 2020.

    The forward contracts to purchase the Company's own shares are classified as a current liability. Equity is reduced by an amount equal to the fair value of the shares at inception. The carrying value of the forward contracts at each reporting period was determined based on the present value of the cost required to settle the contract.
 The changes in ordinary and treasury shares during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

 Income Taxes
        Amcor plc is a tax resident of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ("UK"). Prior to the acquisition of Bemis, the ultimate parent of the Company at June 30, 2018 was Amcor Limited, which was a tax resident of Australia.

    The components of income before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies were as follows:

        The following is a reconciliation of income tax computed at the UK statutory tax rate of 18.5%, 19% and 30% (Australian) for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to income tax expense.

Years ended June 30,

        Amcor operates in over forty different jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. The tax expense from operating in non-UK jurisdictions in excess of the UK statutory tax rate is included in the line "Foreign tax rate differential" in the above tax rate reconciliation table. For fiscal year 2020, the Company's effective tax rate was 22.6% as compared to the effective tax rates of 28.4% and 16.4% for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fiscal year 2020 foreign tax rate differential reflects a benefit related to Swiss tax law changes, which was mostly offset by current period tax charges related to true-up adjustments. Refer to the section "Swiss Tax Reform" in this footnote for a discussion of the benefit realized for Swiss tax law changes which the Company recognized in fiscal year 2020.

    For fiscal year 2020, the Company's effective tax rate for the year was higher than its UK statutory tax rate primarily due to pretax income being earned in jurisdictions outside of the UK where the applicable tax rates are higher than the UK statutory tax rate.
    Significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

June 30,
---------------------------------------------------------------- ------- --------- - -------
(in millions) 2020 2019
Deferred tax assets
Inventories 23.3 6.3
Accrued employee benefits 126.3 103.1
Provisions 5.1 14.1

Total deferred tax assets 522.4 571.1
Valuation allowance (363.8) (290.9)
Net deferred tax assets 158.6 280.2
Deferred tax liabilities
Property, plant and equipment (306.6) (329.2)
Other intangible assets, including impacts from Swiss tax reform (349.5) (638.5)
Trade receivables (7.2) (6.7)
Derivatives (5.4) (20.4)
Undistributed foreign earnings (26.9) (106.2)
Total deferred tax liabilities (695.6) (1,101.0)
Net deferred tax liability (537.0) (820.8)
Deferred tax assets 135.4 190.9
Deferred tax liabilities (672.4) (1,011.7)
Net deferred tax liability $ (537.0) $ (820.8)

        Deferred tax liabilities relating to other intangible assets is shown net of a deferred tax asset arising from Swiss tax reform which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and reflected in the balance as at June 30, 2020. A valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax asset to bring the net amount recorded to the amount more likely than not to be realized. Refer to the section titled "Swiss Tax Reform" for more information.

        The Company maintains a valuation allowance on net operating losses and other deferred tax assets in jurisdictions for which it does not believe it is more likely than not to realize those deferred tax assets based upon all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance, carry-back periods, reversal of taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and earnings expectations. The Company's valuation allowance increased by $72.9 million, increased by $20.4 million and increased by $5.3 million for fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of the Company’s valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily attributed to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset arising from Swiss tax reform.

        The decrease in deferred tax liability related to undistributed foreign earnings in fiscal year 2020 includes the tax impact of the EC Remedy sale of $82.5 million.

        As of June 30, 2020, the Company has UK net operating losses (tax effected) and tax credits of approximately $2.9 million that do not expire. The Company has non-UK net operating losses (tax effected) and other tax attribute carryforwards of $50.9 million, the majority of which do not expire. The Company recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets associated with these net operating losses and tax credits. The benefits of these carryforwards are dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which they arose.

        The Company considers the following factors, among others, in evaluating its plans for indefinite reinvestment of its subsidiaries' earnings: (i) the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries, both for the long term and for the short term; and (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to reinvest earnings of any subsidiary. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $968.2 million of earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. Upon distribution of such earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to incremental foreign tax. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of
foreign tax that might be payable. A cumulative deferred tax liability of $26.9 million has been recorded attributable to undistributed earnings that the Company has deemed are no longer indefinitely reinvested. The remaining undistributed earnings of the Company's subsidiaries are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested and can be repatriated at no tax cost. Accordingly, there is no provision for income or withholding taxes on these earnings.

        The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, "Income Taxes." At June 30, 2020 and 2019, unrecognized tax benefits totaled $101.1 million and $102.6 million, respectively, all of which would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized.

        The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company's accrual for interest and penalties for these uncertain tax positions was $7.1 million, $13.8 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. The Company does not currently anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will result in material changes to its financial position within the next 12 months.

    A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the years presented is as follows:

June 30,
------------------------------------------------------------ ------ ------ ----- ----- - ----
(in millions) 2020 2019 2018
Balance at the beginning of the year $ 102.6 $ 74.5 $ 65.1

Additions related to acquisitions — 29.7 —
Balance at the end of the year $ 101.1 $ 102.6 $ 74.5

        The Company conducts business in a number of tax jurisdictions and, as such, is required to file income tax returns in multiple jurisdictions globally. The years 2016 through 2019 remain open for examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), the year 2019 remains open for examination by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs ("HMRC") and the years 2011 through 2019 are currently subject to audit or remain open for examination in various U.S. states and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.

        The Company believes that its income tax reserves are adequately maintained taking into consideration both the technical merits of its tax return positions and ongoing developments in its income tax audits. However, the final determination of the Company's tax return positions, if audited, is uncertain and therefore there is a possibility that final resolution of these matters could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.

Swiss Tax Reform

        During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, Swiss tax laws were changed in order to remove certain tax regimes and replace these with new measures that are hereafter referred to as "Swiss Tax Reform." In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company obtained confirmation from local authorities as to the methodology to calculate the future benefits and recorded the impact. The net impact was a benefit of $21.7 million, which consisted of a reduction in deferred tax expense from an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes.
 The components of income before income taxes and equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies were as follows:

 Share-based Compensation
        The Company's equity incentive plans include grants of share options, restricted shares/units, performance shares, performance rights and share rights to directors, officers and employees. In certain countries and in selected cases, cash equivalent awards are provided in the event that the issuance of equity awards is not compliant with local legislation and tax laws.

Cash-Settled Awards

        Cash-settled awards may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company in lieu of, or in addition to, participation in other programs.

    Such awards are accounted for as liabilities and are remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date.

    Liabilities for cash-settled share-based compensation are as follows:

June 30,
------------------------------------------------------------------ ---- ---- - ---
(in millions) 2020 2019
Total carrying amount of liabilities for cash settled arrangements $ 1.1 $ 2.7

        During fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company paid $1.6 million, $2.3 million and $1.6 million in cash, respectively, to settle these plans.

Equity-Settled Awards

Share Options

        In fiscal year 2020, share options were granted to officers and employees. The exercise price for shares options was set at the time of grant. There were no share options granted in fiscal year 2019 as they were deferred due to the transaction with Bemis.

        The requisite service period for outstanding share options in fiscal year 2020 ranges from two to four years. The awards are also subject to performance and market conditions. At vesting, share options can be exercised and converted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis, subject to payment of the exercise price. The maximum contractual term of the share options in fiscal year 2020 ranges from five to seven years from the grant date.

    The fair value of the share options granted in fiscal year 2020 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table to produce a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of share options granted was estimated using the following assumptions:

June 30,
--------------------------------------- ---- --- ---
 2020 2019
Expected dividend yield (%) (1) 4.6 % N/A
Expected share price volatility (%) (2) 18.0 % N/A
Risk-free interest rate (%) (3) 1.8 % N/A
Expected life of options (in years) (4) 5.7 N/A

(1)Determined assuming no change in dividend payout during the expected term of the option.
(2)Determined based on the observed historical volatility for the Company's ordinary share price.
(3)Determined based on the yields on U.S. Treasury Bonds in effect at the time of grant with maturities approximately equal to the share options' expected term.
(4)Determined considering the options' contractual terms, historical exercise and post-vesting termination patterns.

    The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjusts compensation expense based on its probability assessment.
    Changes in outstanding share options for the year were as follows:

Share Options Weighted-average Exercise Price Weighted-average Contractual Life
------------------------------------------ ------------------------------- --------------------------------- ----- ---
(in millions) (in years)
Share options outstanding at June 30, 2019 10.8 $ 10.32 3.6
Granted 49.6 10.33 5.7
Exercised (0.2) 6.08 6.9
Forfeited (4.2) 10.63 6.0
Share options outstanding at June 30, 2020 56.0 $ 10.32 5.3
Vested and exercisable at June 30, 2020 2.5 $ 8.78 1.6

        The aggregate intrinsic value (difference in exercise price and closing price at that date) for all share options outstanding at June 30, 2020 was zero. The aggregate intrinsic value for share options vested and exercisable at June 30, 2020 was $3.6 million. The Company received $1.1 million, $19.3 million and $28.1 million and realized a tax benefit of $0.2 million, $5.5 million and $12.3 million on the exercise of stock options during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the intrinsic value associated with the exercise of share options was $0.7 million, $8.3 million and $20.6 million, respectively.

    The weighted-average grant date fair value of share options granted and the fair value of share options vested was as follows:

Years ended June 30,
--------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- --- --- --- ---
 2020 2019 2018
Weighted average grant date fair value of share options granted $ 0.7 N/A $ 1.1
Fair value of share options vested (in millions) $ 0.3 $ 3.8 $ 5.3

Restricted Shares/Units

    Restricted shares/units may be granted to directors, officers and employees of the Company and vest on terms as described in the award. The restrictions prevent the participant from disposing of the restricted shares/units during the vesting period.

    The fair value of restricted shares/units is determined based on the closing price of the Company's shares on the grant date. Changes in the restricted shares/units for the year were as follows:

Restricted Shares/Units Weighted-average Grant Date Fair Value
--------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------- ---- ----
(in millions)
Non-vested restricted shares/units at June 30, 2019 0.5 $ 11.4
Granted 0.4 10.1
Exercised (0.2) 12.1
Forfeited — —
Non-vested restricted shares/units at June 30, 2020 0.7 $ 10.4

    The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted shares granted and the fair value of restricted shares/units vested was as follows:

Years ended June 30,
------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- --- --- ---- ---
 2020 2019 2018
Weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted shares granted $ 10.1 N/A $ 11.5
Fair value of restricted shares/units vested (in millions) $ 2.1 $ 0.2 $ 1.8

Performance Rights and Performance Shares

        In fiscal year 2020, performance rights or performance shares (awarded to U.S. participants in place of performance rights) were granted to officers and employees. There were no performance rights or performance shares granted in fiscal year 2019 as they were deferred due to the transaction with Bemis.

        The requisite service period for outstanding performance rights or performance shares in fiscal year 2020 ranges from two to four years. The awards are also subject to performance and market conditions. At vesting, performance rights can be exercised and converted to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Performance shares vest automatically and convert to ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. There is no amount payable by the participant.

The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...
