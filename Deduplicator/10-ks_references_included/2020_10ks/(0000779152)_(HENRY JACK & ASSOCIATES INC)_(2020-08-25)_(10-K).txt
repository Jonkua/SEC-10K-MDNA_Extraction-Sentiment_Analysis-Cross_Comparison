Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).These changing conditions may affect the estimates and assumptions made by management. Such estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, the valuations of the Company’s long-lived assets, goodwill, and definite-lived intangible assets. If conditions significantly deteriorate, changes in any assumptions used may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, total assets and total equity in the period recognized. Events and changes in circumstances arising subsequent to June 30, 2020, including those resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be reflected in management’s estimates for future periods.REVENUE RECOGNITIONThe Company generates "Services and Support" revenue through software licensing and related services, outsourcing core and complementary software solutions, professional services, and hardware sales. The Company generates "Processing" revenue through processing of remittance transactions, card transactions and monthly fees, and digital transactions.Significant Judgments in Application of the GuidanceIdentification of Performance ObligationsThe Company enters into contracts with customers that may include multiple types of goods and services. At contract inception, the Company assesses the solutions and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - that is, if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. Significant judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer.Determination of Transaction PriceThe amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. The Company’s contracts with its customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration. The Company estimates variable consideration in its contracts primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. Where appropriate, the Company may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount. Significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of customer contracts that are long-term and include uncertain transactional volumes.Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue. The Company includes reimbursements from customers for expenses incurred in providing services (such as for postage, travel and telecommunications costs) in revenue, while the related costs are included in cost of revenue.Technology or service components from third parties are frequently included in or combined with the Company’s applications or service offerings. Whether the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained involves judgment in determining whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. This assessment is made at the performance obligation level.Allocation of Transaction PriceThe transaction price, once determined, is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells each good or service. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available, including reference to historical pricing data.The following describes the nature of the Company’s primary types of revenue:ProcessingProcessing revenue is generated from transaction-based fees for electronic deposit and payment services, electronic funds transfers and debit and credit card processing. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis by processing an unspecified number of transactions over the contractual term. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services), and pricing may include tiered pricing structures. Amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed. Customers are typically billed monthly for transactions processed during the month. The Company evaluates tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists. If, after that evaluation, it determines a material right does exist, it assigns value to the material right based upon standalone selling price after estimation of breakage associated with the material right.Outsourcing and CloudOutsourcing and cloud revenue is generated from data and item processing services and hosting fees. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services), and pricing may include tiered pricing structures. Amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed. Data and item processing services are typically billed monthly. The Company evaluates tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists. If, after that evaluation, it determines a material right does exist, it assigns value to the material right based upon standalone selling price.Product Delivery and ServicesProduct delivery and services revenue is generated primarily from software licensing and related professional services and hardware delivery. Software licenses, along with any professional services from which they are not considered distinct, are recognized as they are delivered to the customer. Hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery. Professional services that are distinct are recognized as the services are performed. Deconversion fees are also included within product delivery and services and are considered a contract modification. Therefore, the Company recognizes these fees over the remaining modified contract term. In-House SupportIn-house support revenue is generated from software maintenance for ongoing client support and software usage, which includes a license and ongoing client support. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services). Software maintenance fees are typically billed to the customer annually in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Software usage is typically billed annually in advance, with the license delivered and recognized at the outset, and the maintenance fee recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Accordingly, the Company utilizes the practical expedient which allows entities to disregard the effects of a financing component when the contract period is one year or less.COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENTThe Company capitalizes new product development costs incurred for software to be sold from the point at which technological feasibility has been established through the point at which the product is ready for general availability. Software development costs that are capitalized are evaluated on a product-by-product basis annually and are assigned an estimated economic life based on the type of product, market characteristics, and maturity of the market for that particular product. These costs are amortized based on current and estimated future revenue from the product or on a straight-line basis, whichever yields greater amortization expense. All of this amortization expense is included within components of operating income, primarily cost of revenue.The Company capitalizes development costs for internal use software beginning at the start of application development. Amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life.CASH EQUIVALENTSThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEReceivables are recorded at the time of billing. A reasonable estimate of the realizability of customer receivables is made through the establishment of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is estimated based on a combination of write-off history, aging analysis, and any specifically known collection issues.PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSProperty and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.Intangible assets consist of goodwill, customer relationships, computer software, and trade names acquired in business acquisitions in addition to internally developed computer software. The amounts are amortized, with the exception of those with an indefinite life (goodwill), over an estimated economic benefit period, generally three to twenty years.The Company reviews its long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of its assets might not be recoverable. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment of value on an annual basis as of January 1 and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.PURCHASE OF INVESTMENTThe Company has invested $6,000 in the preferred stock of Automated Bookkeeping, Inc ("Autobooks"), which represents a non-controlling share of the voting equity of Autobooks. This investment was recorded at cost and is included within other non-current assets on the Company's balance sheet. The fair value of this investment has not been estimated, as estimation is not practicable. There have been no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an impairment and no price changes resulting from observing a similar or identical investment. An impairment and/or an observable price change would be an adjustment to recorded cost. Fair value will not be estimated unless there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment.COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income for each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 equals the Company’s net income.REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATIONIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company's operations are classified as four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other (see Note 14). Substantially all the Company’s revenues are derived from operations and assets located within the United States of America.COMMON STOCKThe Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock. Under this authorization, the Company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or short-term borrowings on its existing credit facilities. The share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time. At June 30, 2020, there were 26,993 shares in treasury stock and the Company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 2,998 additional shares. The total cost of treasury shares at June 30, 2020 is $1,181,673. During fiscal 2020, the Company repurchased 485 treasury shares for $71,549. At June 30, 2019, there were 26,508 shares in treasury stock and the Company had authority to repurchase up to 3,483 additional shares.EARNINGS PER SHAREPer share information is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Stock options and restricted stock have been included in the calculation of income per diluted share to the extent they are dilutive. The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock (see Note 11). INCOME TAXESDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Also, interest and penalties expense are recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company's policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSRecently Adopted Accounting GuidanceIn August of 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles, Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), which broadens the scope of Subtopic 350-40 to include costs incurred to implement a hosting arrangement that is a service contract. The costs are capitalized or expensed depending on the nature of the costs and the project stage during which they are incurred, consistent with costs for internal-use software. The amendments in this update can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The required ASU effective date for the Company is July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The Company early-adopted ASU No. 2018-15 for its fiscal 2020 third quarter. The Company chose prospective adoption and there was no material impact on its consolidated financial statements for the quarter or year-to-date period.The FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, in February 2016. This ASU aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information regarding leasing arrangements to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. Specifically, the standard requires operating lease commitments to be recorded on the balance sheet as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, and the cost of those operating leases to be amortized on a straight-line basis. The Company adopted the new standard effective July 1, 2019 using the optional transition method in ASU 2018-11. Under this method, the Company did not adjust its comparative period financial statements for the effects of the new standard or make the new, expanded required disclosures for periods prior to the effective date. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the new standard, which among other things, allows it to carry forward its historical lease classifications. In addition, the Company has made a policy election to keep leases with an initial term of twelve months or less off of the balance sheet. The Company also elected the practical expedient to not separate the non-lease components of a contract from the lease component to which they relate.The adoption of the standard resulted in the recognition of lease liabilities of $77,393 and right-to-use assets of $74,084 as of July 1, 2019. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income or condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted [Text Block] Not Adopted at Fiscal Year EndIn December of 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which removes certain exceptions and simplifies other requirements of Topic 740 guidance. The ASU will be effective for the Company on July 1, 2021. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. An entity that elects to early adopt the amendments in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. The Company will adopt ASU No. 2019-12 when required, or sooner as allowed, and is assessing the timing of adoption and evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test that had required a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Rather, entities should apply the same impairment assessment to all reporting units and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Entities will continue to have the option to perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. ASU No. 2017-04 will be effective prospectively for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-04 on July 1, 2020 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, with an allowance for credit losses valuation account that is deducted to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impacts of adopting this standard, including the processes, systems, data and controls that will be necessary to estimate credit reserves for impacted areas. Financial assets held by the Company subject to the “expected credit loss” model prescribed by the standard include trade and other receivables and contract assets. While the Company continues to evaluate the expected impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, it currently expects the adoption of this guidance will result in an acceleration in the timing for recognition of credit losses, and may also result in an increase in the reserve for these credit losses due to the requirement to record upfront the losses that are expected over the remaining contractual lives of its financial assets. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 on July 1, 2020 and does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Contract Balances
The following table provides information about contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers.

June 30,2020 June 30,2019
---------------------------------------------------- ------------ ------- - -------
Receivables, net $ 300,945 $ 310,080
Contract Assets- Current 21,609 21,446
Contract Assets- Non-current 54,293 50,640
Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue)- Current 318,161 339,752
Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue)- Non-current 71,461 54,554

Contract assets primarily result from revenue being recognized when or as control of a solution or service is transferred to the customer, but where invoicing is contingent upon the completion of other performance obligations or payment terms differ from the provisioning of services. The current portion of contract assets is reported within prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet, and the non-current portion is included in other non-current assets. Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to consideration received from customers in advance of delivery of the related goods and services to the customer. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
The Company analyzes contract language to identify if a significant financing component does exist and would adjust the transaction price for any material effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either party to the contract with a significant benefit of financing the transaction.
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $259,887, $265,946, and $269,593, respectively, that was included in the corresponding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the periods.
Amounts recognized that relate to performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in prior periods were immaterial for each period presented. These adjustments are primarily the result of transaction price re-allocations due to changes in estimates of variable consideration.
Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations
As of June 30, 2020, estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period totaled $4,204,569. The Company expects to recognize approximately 28% over the next 12 months, 19% in 13-24 months, and the balance thereafter.
Contract Costs
The Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions, which are incurred only if a contract is obtained, and customer conversion or implementation-related costs. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates, in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated.
Capitalized costs totaled $271,010 and $231,273, at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, amortization of deferred contract costs totaled $117,763, $110,894, and $94,337 respectively. There were no impairment losses in relation to capitalized costs for the periods presented.

The following analysis reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rates reflected above:

 Year Ended June 30,
------------------------------------------------------ ------------------- ---- ----- - ------ -
 2020 2019 2018
Computed "expected" tax expense 21.0 % 21.0 % 28.1 %
Increase (reduction) in taxes resulting from:
State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefits 3.6 % 3.7 % 2.9 %
Research and development credit (2.4) % (2.5) % (2.0) %
Domestic production activities deduction — % — % (1.4) %
TCJA deferred tax rate re-measurement — % — % (30.0) %
Tax effects of share-based payments (0.1) % (1.4) % (0.8) %
Other (net) — % 0.9 % 0.7 %
 22.1 % 21.7 % (2.5) %

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") was enacted into law. The TCJA included numerous provisions that impacted the Company, including reducing the U.S. federal tax rate, eliminating the Domestic Production Activities Deduction, and providing expanded asset expensing. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, a blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate of approximately 28% applied to the Company.
As of June 30, 2020, the Company has $8,108 of gross federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards pertaining to the acquisition of Goldleaf Financial Solutions, Inc., BOLTS, and Geezeo, which are expected to be utilized after the application of IRC Section 382. Separately, as of June 30, 2020, the Company has state NOL carryforwards with a tax-effected value of $532. The federal and state losses have varying expiration dates, ranging from fiscal 2021 to 2040. Based on state tax rules which restrict utilization of these losses, the Company believes it is more likely than not that $473 of these losses will expire unutilized. Accordingly, a valuation allowance of $473 and $415 has been recorded against the state net operating losses as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company paid income taxes, net of refunds, of $63,692, $62,005, and $60,382 in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
At June 30, 2020, the Company had $10,112 of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $9,434 of which, if recognized, would affect its effective tax rate. At June 30, 2019, the Company had $10,495 of unrecognized tax benefits, $9,892 of which, if recognized, would affect its effective tax rate. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $1,565 and $1,514 related to uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The income tax provision included interest expense and penalties (or benefits) on unrecognized tax benefits of $38, $128, and $165 in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 follows:

 Unrecognized Tax Benefits
----------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ------
Balance at July 1, 2018 $ 10,227
Additions for current year tax positions 1,135
Reductions for current year tax positions (40)
Additions for prior year tax positions 562
Reductions for prior year tax positions (531)
Additions related to business combinations 43
Settlements (25)
Reductions related to expirations of statute of limitations (876)
Balance at June 30, 2019 10,495
Additions for current year tax positions 1,451
Additions for prior year tax positions 867
Additions related to business combinations 192
Reductions related to expirations of statute of limitations (2,893)
Balance at June 30, 2020 $ 10,112

The U.S. federal and state income tax returns for fiscal 2017 and all subsequent years remain subject to examination as of June 30, 2020 under statute of limitations rules. The Company anticipates that potential changes due to lapsing statutes of limitations and examination closures could reduce the unrecognized tax benefits balance by $3,500 - $4,500 within twelve months of June 30, 2020.

Risks and Uncertainties [Abstract]
Industry and Supplier Concentrations [Text Block] INDUSTRY AND SUPPLIER CONCENTRATIONSThe Company sells its products to banks, credit unions, and financial institutions throughout the United States and generally does not require collateral. All billings to customers are due 30 days from date of billing. Reserves (which are insignificant at June 30, 2020 and 2019) are maintained for potential credit losses. Customer-related risks are moderated through the inclusion of credit mitigation clauses in the Company's contracts and through the monitoring of timely payments. In addition, some of the Company’s key solutions are dependent on technology manufactured by IBM Corporation and Microsoft. Termination of the Company’s relationship with either IBM or Microsoft could have a negative impact on the operations of the Company.

There were no options granted in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018.
The Company utilized a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of the stock option grants at the grant date. All remaining options were granted on July 1, 2016. Assumptions such as expected life, volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield impact the fair value estimate. These assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. The risk-free interest rate used in the Company's estimate was determined from external data, while volatility, expected life, and dividend yield assumptions were derived from its historical experience with share-based payment arrangements. The appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment, based on relevant facts and circumstances. The assumptions used in estimating fair value and resulting compensation expenses at the grant dates are as follows:

Expected Life (years) 6.50 years
----------------------- ---------- -
Volatility 19.60 %
Risk-free interest rate 1.24 %
Dividend yield 1.28 %

At June 30, 2020, there was no compensation cost yet to be recognized related to outstanding options.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $809, $2,289, and $2,165 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Restricted Stock Plan and 2015 Equity Incentive Plan
The Restricted Stock Plan was adopted by the Company on November 1, 2005, for its employees. The plan expired on November 1, 2015. Up to 3,000 shares of common stock were available for issuance under the plan. The 2015 EIP was adopted by the Company on November 10, 2015 for its employees. Up to 3,000 shares of common stock are available for issuance under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. Upon issuance, shares of restricted stock are subject to forfeiture and to restrictions which limit the sale or transfer of the shares during the restriction period. The restrictions are lifted over periods ranging from 3 years to 5 years from grant date.
The following table summarizes non-vested share awards activity:

Share awards Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value
------------------------- ------ -------------------------------------- -----
Outstanding July 1, 2017 36 $ 73.66
Granted — —
Vested (12) 58.61

Vested (6) 87.27
Forfeited — —
Outstanding June 30, 2020 — $ —

The non-vested share awards granted prior to July 1, 2016 do not participate in dividends during the restriction period. As a result, the weighted-average fair value of the non-vested share awards was based on the fair market value of the Company’s equity shares on the grant date, less the present value of the expected future dividends to be declared during the restriction period, consistent with the methodology for calculating compensation expense on such awards. The non-vested share awards granted during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 do participate in dividends during the restriction period. The weighted-average fair value of such participating awards was based on the fair market value on the grant date.
At June 30, 2020, there was no compensation expense yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock share awards.
An amendment to the Restricted Stock Plan was adopted by the Company on August 20, 2010. Unit awards were made to employees remaining in continuous employment throughout the performance period and vary based on the Company’s percentile ranking in Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) over the performance period compared to a peer group, or peer groups, of companies. TSR is defined as the change in the stock price through the performance period plus dividends per share paid during the performance period, all divided by the stock price at the beginning of the performance period. It is the intention of the Company to settle the unit awards in shares of the Company’s stock. Certain Restricted Stock Unit awards are not tied to performance goals, and for such awards, vesting occurs over a period of 1 to 3 years.
The following table summarizes non-vested unit awards as of June 30, 2020, as well as activity for the fiscal year then ended:

Unit awards Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Aggregate Intrinsic Value
------------------------- ------ -------------------------------------- -------------------------
Outstanding July 1, 2017 386 $ 67.84

Forfeited (61) 85.33
Outstanding June 30, 2020 307 $136.41 $56,476

The 139 unit awards granted in fiscal 2020 had service requirements and performance targets, with 99 only having service requirements. Those 99 were valued at the weighted-average fair value of the non-vested units based on the fair market value of the Company’s equity shares on the grant date, less the present value of expected future dividends to be declared during the vesting period, consistent with the methodology for calculating compensation expense on such awards. The remaining 40 unit awards granted in fiscal 2020 had performance targets along with service requirements, 38 of which were valued using a Monte Carlo pricing model as of the measurement date customized to the specific provisions of the Company’s plan design to value the unit awards as of the grant date. The remaining unit awards granted in fiscal 2020 had other performance targets. Per the Company's award vesting and settlement provisions, approximately half of the awards that utilize a Monte Carlo pricing model were valued at grant on the basis of TSR in comparison to the compensation peer group approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors for fiscal year 2020, and the other half of the awards utilizing a Monte Carlo pricing model were valued at grant on the basis of TSR in comparison to the Standard & Poor's 1500 Information Technology Index ("S&P 1500 IT Index") participants.
The weighted average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo pricing model to estimate fair value at the grant dates for awards with performance targets and service requirements are as follows:

Retirement Benefits [Abstract]
Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 401(k) Disclosure [Text Block] EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSThe Company established an employee stock purchase plan in 2006. The plan allows the majority of employees the opportunity to directly purchase shares of the Company at 85% of the closing price of the Company's stock on or around the fifteenth day of each month. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, employees purchased 74, 76, and 76 shares under this plan at average prices of $132.51, $118.32, and $98.46, respectively. As of June 30, 2020, approximately 1,230 shares remained available for future issuance under the plan. The plan does not meet the criteria as a non-compensatory plan. As a result, the Company records the total dollar value of the stock discount given to employees under the plan as expense. The Company has a defined contribution plan for its employees: the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1975 (“ERISA”) as amended. Under the Plan, the Company matches 100% of full-time employee contributions up to 5% of eligible compensation. Prior to January 1, 2019, the Company match was subject to a maximum of $5 per year. On January 1, 2019, the maximum limit was removed. In order to receive matching contributions, employees must be 18 years of age and be employed for at least six months. The Company has the option of making a discretionary contribution; however, none has been made for any of the three most recent fiscal years. The total matching contributions for the Plan were $25,155, $21,003, and $18,821 for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Accounting Policies [Abstract]
Consolidation CONSOLIDATIONThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JHA and all of its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned, and all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates USE OF ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Risks and UncertaintiesThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets during 2020 (see “COVID-19 Impact and Response” in Item 1. Business and in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).These changing conditions may affect the estimates and assumptions made by management. Such estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, the valuations of the Company’s long-lived assets, goodwill, and definite-lived intangible assets. If conditions significantly deteriorate, changes in any assumptions used may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, total assets and total equity in the period recognized. Events and changes in circumstances arising subsequent to June 30, 2020, including those resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be reflected in management’s estimates for future periods.
Revenue Recognition REVENUE RECOGNITIONThe Company generates "Services and Support" revenue through software licensing and related services, outsourcing core and complementary software solutions, professional services, and hardware sales. The Company generates "Processing" revenue through processing of remittance transactions, card transactions and monthly fees, and digital transactions.Significant Judgments in Application of the GuidanceIdentification of Performance ObligationsThe Company enters into contracts with customers that may include multiple types of goods and services. At contract inception, the Company assesses the solutions and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - that is, if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. Significant judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer.Determination of Transaction PriceThe amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. The Company’s contracts with its customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration. The Company estimates variable consideration in its contracts primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. Where appropriate, the Company may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount. Significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of customer contracts that are long-term and include uncertain transactional volumes.Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue. The Company includes reimbursements from customers for expenses incurred in providing services (such as for postage, travel and telecommunications costs) in revenue, while the related costs are included in cost of revenue.Technology or service components from third parties are frequently included in or combined with the Company’s applications or service offerings. Whether the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained involves judgment in determining whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. This assessment is made at the performance obligation level.Allocation of Transaction PriceThe transaction price, once determined, is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells each good or service. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available, including reference to historical pricing data.The following describes the nature of the Company’s primary types of revenue:ProcessingProcessing revenue is generated from transaction-based fees for electronic deposit and payment services, electronic funds transfers and debit and credit card processing. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis by processing an unspecified number of transactions over the contractual term. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services), and pricing may include tiered pricing structures. Amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed. Customers are typically billed monthly for transactions processed during the month. The Company evaluates tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists. If, after that evaluation, it determines a material right does exist, it assigns value to the material right based upon standalone selling price after estimation of breakage associated with the material right.Outsourcing and CloudOutsourcing and cloud revenue is generated from data and item processing services and hosting fees. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services), and pricing may include tiered pricing structures. Amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed. Data and item processing services are typically billed monthly. The Company evaluates tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists. If, after that evaluation, it determines a material right does exist, it assigns value to the material right based upon standalone selling price.Product Delivery and ServicesProduct delivery and services revenue is generated primarily from software licensing and related professional services and hardware delivery. Software licenses, along with any professional services from which they are not considered distinct, are recognized as they are delivered to the customer. Hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery. Professional services that are distinct are recognized as the services are performed. Deconversion fees are also included within product delivery and services and are considered a contract modification. Therefore, the Company recognizes these fees over the remaining modified contract term. In-House SupportIn-house support revenue is generated from software maintenance for ongoing client support and software usage, which includes a license and ongoing client support. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services). Software maintenance fees are typically billed to the customer annually in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Software usage is typically billed annually in advance, with the license delivered and recognized at the outset, and the maintenance fee recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Accordingly, the Company utilizes the practical expedient which allows entities to disregard the effects of a financing component when the contract period is one year or less.
Computer Software Development COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENTThe Company capitalizes new product development costs incurred for software to be sold from the point at which technological feasibility has been established through the point at which the product is ready for general availability. Software development costs that are capitalized are evaluated on a product-by-product basis annually and are assigned an estimated economic life based on the type of product, market characteristics, and maturity of the market for that particular product. These costs are amortized based on current and estimated future revenue from the product or on a straight-line basis, whichever yields greater amortization expense. All of this amortization expense is included within components of operating income, primarily cost of revenue.
Internal Use Software The Company capitalizes development costs for internal use software beginning at the start of application development. Amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life.
Cash Equivalents CASH EQUIVALENTSThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLEReceivables are recorded at the time of billing. A reasonable estimate of the realizability of customer receivables is made through the establishment of an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is estimated based on a combination of write-off history, aging analysis, and any specifically known collection issues.
Property and Equipment PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSProperty and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Intangible Assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill, customer relationships, computer software, and trade names acquired in business acquisitions in addition to internally developed computer software. The amounts are amortized, with the exception of those with an indefinite life (goodwill), over an estimated economic benefit period, generally three to twenty years.The Company reviews its long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of its assets might not be recoverable. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment of value on an annual basis as of January 1 and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
Comprehensive Income COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEComprehensive income for each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 equals the Company’s net income.
Reportable Segment Information REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATIONIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company's operations are classified as four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other (see Note 14). Substantially all the Company’s revenues are derived from operations and assets located within the United States of America.
Common Stock COMMON STOCKThe Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock. Under this authorization, the Company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or short-term borrowings on its existing credit facilities. The share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time.
Earnings Per Share EARNINGS PER SHAREPer share information is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Stock options and restricted stock have been included in the calculation of income per diluted share to the extent they are dilutive. The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock (see Note 11).
Income Taxes INCOME TAXESDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Also, interest and penalties expense are recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company's policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Note 11.Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Legal Matters Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking 94  unspecified damages and injunctive relief.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...

Contract Balances
The following table provides information about contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers.

June 30,2020 June 30,2019
---------------------------------------------------- ------------ ------- - -------
Receivables, net $ 300,945 $ 310,080
Contract Assets- Current 21,609 21,446
Contract Assets- Non-current 54,293 50,640
Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue)- Current 318,161 339,752
Contract Liabilities (Deferred Revenue)- Non-current 71,461 54,554

Contract assets primarily result from revenue being recognized when or as control of a solution or service is transferred to the customer, but where invoicing is contingent upon the completion of other performance obligations or payment terms differ from the provisioning of services. The current portion of contract assets is reported within prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet, and the non-current portion is included in other non-current assets. Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to consideration received from customers in advance of delivery of the related goods and services to the customer. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
The Company analyzes contract language to identify if a significant financing component does exist and would adjust the transaction price for any material effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either party to the contract with a significant benefit of financing the transaction.
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized revenue of $259,887, $265,946, and $269,593, respectively, that was included in the corresponding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the periods.
Amounts recognized that relate to performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in prior periods were immaterial for each period presented. These adjustments are primarily the result of transaction price re-allocations due to changes in estimates of variable consideration.
Transaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations
As of June 30, 2020, estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period totaled $4,204,569. The Company expects to recognize approximately 28% over the next 12 months, 19% in 13-24 months, and the balance thereafter.
Contract Costs
The Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions, which are incurred only if a contract is obtained, and customer conversion or implementation-related costs. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates, in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated.
Capitalized costs totaled $271,010 and $231,273, at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, amortization of deferred contract costs totaled $117,763, $110,894, and $94,337 respectively. There were no impairment losses in relation to capitalized costs for the periods presented.

Accounting Policies [Abstract]
Consolidation CONSOLIDATIONThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JHA and all of its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned, and all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates USE OF ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Risks and UncertaintiesThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets during 2020 (see “COVID-19 Impact and Response” in Item 1. Business and in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).These changing conditions may affect the estimates and assumptions made by management. Such estimates and assumptions affect, among other things, the valuations of the Company’s long-lived assets, goodwill, and definite-lived intangible assets. If conditions significantly deteriorate, changes in any assumptions used may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, total assets and total equity in the period recognized. Events and changes in circumstances arising subsequent to June 30, 2020, including those resulting from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be reflected in management’s estimates for future periods.
