ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This Management Discussion and Analysis should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data included in this Form 10-K. Certain references to particular information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are made to assist readers.

OVERVIEW

Whirlpool had full-year GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool of $1.2 billion (net earnings margin of 5.8%), or $18.45 per share, compared to GAAP net loss available to Whirlpool of $183 million (net earnings margin of (0.9)%), or $(2.72) per share in the same prior-year period. On a GAAP basis, net earnings were favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of our Embraco compressor business of approximately $511 million, partially offset by product warranty and liability expense of approximately $131 million and losses associated with strategic actions executed in EMEA of approximately $74 million. In the same prior-year period, non-recurring items negatively impacted net earnings available to Whirlpool by approximately $850 million. Solid cash provided by operating activities of $1.2 billion was driven by higher earnings and working capital improvement.

Whirlpool delivered ongoing (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $16.00 and full-year ongoing EBIT margin of 6.9%, compared to 6.3% in the same prior-year period. These results were driven by positive price/mix and strong cost discipline, which were partially offset by cost inflation, increased brand investments and currency. In addition, we delivered strong free cash flow (non-GAAP) of $912 million, primarily driven by working capital improvement and lower capital expenditures. Lastly, we strengthened our balance sheet and made strong progress toward our long-term Gross Debt to EBITDA target of approximately 2.0.

We are very pleased with the successful execution of our strong price-mix actions driven by new product introductions and cost-based price increases and targeted cost takeout. In addition, the strong actions to restore profitability in EMEA resulted in approximately $75 million of EBIT improvement compared to the prior-year.

We are committed to generating margin expansion and strong cash flow and are confident that our actions will drive positive results in 2020 as outlined in our long-term value creation strategy.

Consolidated net sales for 2019 decreased 2.9% compared to 2018, primarily driven by the divestiture of the Embraco compressor business, unfavorable foreign currency and unit volume declines, partially offset by the favorable impact of product price/mix. Organic net sales, or net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency and Embraco, for 2019 increased 1.6% compared to 2018. Consolidated net sales for 2018 decreased 1.0% compared to 2017, primarily driven by unit volume declines and unfavorable foreign currency, partially offset by favorable impacts from product price/mix. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, consolidated net sales for 2018 decreased 0.1% compared to 2017.
For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures including organic net sales and net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis.
The chart below summarizes the balance of net sales by operating segment for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

25

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2019 increased to 17.3% compared to 16.8% in 2018, primarily driven by the favorable impact of product price/mix, cost reduction initiatives in the EMEA region and a gain on sale-leaseback, partially offset by lower unit volumes, cost inflation (raw material, tariff and freight costs) in the North America region, unfavorable foreign currency and product warranty expense related to EMEA-produced washers. The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2018 decreased to 16.8% compared to 16.9% in 2017, primarily driven by unfavorable impacts from raw material inflation across all regions and cost inflation (raw material, tariff and freight costs) in the North America region, lower unit volumes in the EMEA region, partially offset by the favorable impact of product price/mix and restructuring benefits.
Our operating segments are based upon geographical region and are defined as North America, EMEA, Latin America and Asia. These regions also represent our reportable segments. The chief operating decision maker evaluates performance based on each segment's earnings (loss) before interest and taxes (EBIT), which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry (income) expense and excluding restructuring costs, asset impairment charges and certain other items that management believes are not indicative of the region's ongoing performance, if any. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
The following is a discussion of results for each of our operating segments.

Selling, General and Administrative
The following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by operating segment:

------------------- ------------ ----- ------------------ ---- ---- - ------------------ - ----- ---- ------------------ ---- --- - ----- --- -

 December 31,
Millions of dollars 2019 As a %of Net Sales 2018 As a %of Net Sales 2017 As a %of Net Sales
North America $ 826 7.2 % $ 787 6.9 % $ 751 6.8 %
EMEA 497 11.6 564 12.4 557 11.4
Latin America 306 9.6 369 10.2 356 9.0
Asia 253 16.7 244 15.4 258 16.8
Corporate/other 260 — 225 — 190 —
Consolidated $ 2,142 10.5 % $ 2,189 10.4 % $ 2,112 9.9 %

Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2019 is comparable to 2018. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2018 increased compared to 2017 due to expenses related to the bad debt expense from a Brazilian retailer, expenses related to the sale of the Embraco compressor business and the negative impact of unit volume declines.

Restructuring
We incurred restructuring charges of $188 million, $247 million and $275 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the full year 2020, we expect to incur up to $100 million of restructuring charges, driven by previously announced fixed cost reduction actions in the EMEA region.
See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles

We recorded an impairment charge of $747 million related to goodwill ($579 million) and other intangibles ($168 million) for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the EMEA reporting unit.

See Note 6 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.
(Gain) Loss on Sale and Disposal of Businesses
We recorded a pre-tax gain of $511 million on the sale of the Embraco compressor business for the year ended December 31, 2019.
We recorded a loss of $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to charges on the sale of the South Africa business ($63 million) and costs associated with the exit of the Turkey domestic sales operations ($11 million).
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Interest and Sundry (Income) Expense
Interest and sundry (income) expenses were $(168) million, $108 million and $87 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Interest and sundry income in 2019 primarily includes the effect of Brazil indirect tax credits recorded of $180 million, which reflects $196 million of indirect tax credits, net of related fees, partially offset by a trade customer insolvency claim settlement of €52.75 million (approximately $59 million as of December 31, 2019) and foreign currency.
Interest and sundry expense increased $21 million in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the French Competition Authority (FCA) settlement agreement, partially offset by Latin America tax credits and a favorable impact from foreign currency.

31

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $187 million, $192 million and $162 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense in 2019 was comparable to 2018. During 2018, interest expense increased by $30 million compared to 2017. This was primarily due to higher average debt and notes payable balances and higher average interest rates.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $354 million, $138 million and $550 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in tax expense in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to higher earnings before tax, reduced foreign tax credits and the sale of Embraco, partially offset by net reductions in valuation allowances, and impacts from a statutory legal entity merger. As part of ongoing efforts to reduce costs and simplify the Company's legal entity structure, the Company has completed a statutory legal entity merger within our EMEA business. The completion of the merger created a tax-deductible loss which was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, and resulted in a $147 million tax benefit.
The decrease in tax expense in 2018 compared to 2017 is primarily due to lower level of earnings, the reduction in statutory U.S. tax rate from 35% to 21%, impact of non-deductible goodwill impairments and government payment accruals, valuation allowances and tax planning actions.
See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE
Earnings per diluted share presented below are net of tax, while each adjustment is presented on a pre-tax basis. The aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated 2020 full-year tax rate between 20% and 25%. We currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2020 to be within the following ranges:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- - ------

 2020
 Current Outlook
Estimated earnings per diluted share, for the year ending December 31, 2020 $14.80 — $15.80
Including:
Restructuring Expense $(1.56)
Income Tax Impact $0.36

Industry demand
North America (1)% — 1%
EMEA 1% — 2%
Latin America 3% — 4%
Asia (1)% — 1%

For the full-year 2020, we expect to generate cash from operating activities of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion and free cash flow of approximately $800 million to $900 million, including restructuring cash outlays of up to $200 million and, with respect to free cash flow, capital expenditures of approximately $550 million.
The table below reconciles projected 2020 cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named non-GAAP measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations. For 2020 we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assets/businesses. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

 2020
Millions of dollars Current Outlook
Cash provided by operating activities(1) $ 1,350 — $ 1,450
Capital expenditures and proceeds from sale of assets/businesses (550)
Free cash flow $ 800 — $ 900

(1) Financial guidance on a GAAP basis for cash provided by (used in) financing activities and cash provided by (used in) investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection, the Company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control.
The projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the Board of Directors of Whirlpool, and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as "ongoing" measures, including:

- -----------------------------------------
• Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)

- -----------
• EBIT margin

- ------------
• Ongoing EBIT

- -------------------
• Ongoing EBIT margin

- ------------------------
• Sales excluding currency

- -----------------
• Ongoing net sales

- -----------------
• Organic net sales

- --------------
• Free cash flow

Non-GAAP measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. EBIT margin is calculated by dividing EBIT by net sales. Ongoing EBIT margin is calculated by dividing ongoing EBIT by net sales for 2019 and 2018 and ongoing net sales for 2017. Ongoing net sales for 2017 excludes $32 million primarily related to an adjustment for trade promotion accruals in prior periods. Sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales, in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's exchange rate compared to the prior-year period net sales. Organic net sales is calculated by excluding divestitures and foreign currency. Management believes that organic net sales and sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We also disclose segment EBIT, which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry (income) expense and excluding restructuring costs, asset impairment charges and certain other items, if any, that management believes are not indicative of the region's ongoing performance, as the financial metric used by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. The Company provides free cash flow related metrics, such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales, as long-term management goals, not an element of its annual financial guidance, and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for these long-term goal metrics. Any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the Company's control. Whirlpool does not provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for its other forward-looking long-term value creation and other goals, such as organic net sales, EBIT, and gross debt/EBITDA, as such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company’s control.
We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible

to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool, net sales, net earnings as a percentage of net sales and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.
Please refer to a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below.

(3) Proceeds from the sale of assets and business for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 include $1,011 million of net cash proceeds received to date for the sale of the Embraco compressor business; $1,000 million of these proceeds were used to repay an outstanding term loan in August 2019.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying the maturity structure, we avoid concentrations of debt, reducing liquidity risk. We have varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business. We regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities, which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives, funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities, providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions.
Our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending, restructuring activities, and returns to shareholders. We also have $559 million of term debt maturing in the next twelve months, and are currently evaluating our options in connection with this maturing debt, which may include repayment through refinancing, free cash flow generation, or cash on hand.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2019, of which the significant majority was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries. Our cash and cash equivalents are temporarily elevated as of December 31, 2019 from commercial paper outstanding of $274 million that was subsequently repaid after year-end. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and expected future foreign investments. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (if any) and withholding taxes payable to various countries. It is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation.
At December 31, 2019, we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in China, Brazil, the United States and India, which represented 2.5%, 2.0%, 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively. In addition, we did not have any third-party accounts receivable greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of the United States. We continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally.
Notes payable consists of short-term borrowings payable to banks and commercial paper, which are generally used to fund working capital requirements. At December 31, 2019, we had $294 million of notes payable outstanding which primarily included $274 million of commercial paper. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
We monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending, depository, derivative counterparty banks and customers regularly, and take certain action to manage credit risk. We diversify our deposits and investments in short-term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

In June 2018, Whirlpool of India Limited (Whirlpool India), a majority-owned subsidiary of Whirlpool Corporation, acquired a 49% equity interest in Elica PB India for $22 million. Whirlpool India has an option to acquire the remaining equity interest in the future for fair value, and the non-Whirlpool India shareholders of Elica PB India received an option to sell their remaining equity interest to Whirlpool India in the future for fair value, which could be material to the financial statements depending on the performance of the venture. We account for our minority interest under the equity method of accounting.

We continue to review customer conditions globally. At December 31, 2019, we had 272 million Brazilian reais (approximately $68 million at December 31, 2019) in short and long-term receivables due to us from Maquina de Vendas S.A., a trade customer in Brazil. In 2018, as part of their extrajudicial recovery plan, we agreed to receive payment of our outstanding receivable, plus interest, over eight years under a tiered payment schedule. At December 31, 2019, we have 129 million Brazilian reais (approximately $32 million at December 31, 2019) of insurance against this credit risk through policies purchased from high-quality underwriters.

In the past, when faced with a potential volume reduction from any one particular segment of our trade distribution network, we generally have been able to offset such declines through increased sales throughout our broad distribution network.

Embraco Sale Transaction

On April 24, 2018, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a purchase agreement with Nidec Corporation, a leading manufacturer of electric motors incorporated under the laws of Japan, to sell our Embraco business unit (the "Transaction").

On June 26, 2019, Whirlpool and Nidec received the European Commission's final approval of the Transaction, and the parties closed the Transaction on July 1, 2019. At closing, pursuant to the purchase agreement and a subsequent agreement memorializing the purchase price adjustment, the Company received $1.1 billion inclusive of anticipated cash on hand at the time of closing, with final purchase price amounts subject to working capital and other customary post-closing adjustments. Whirlpool has agreed to retain certain liabilities relating to tax, environmental, labor and products following closing of the Transaction.

On August 9, 2019, the Company repaid $1.0 billion pursuant to the Company's April 23, 2018 Term Loan Agreement by and among the Company, Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Syndication Agent, and certain other financial institutions, representing full repayment of amounts borrowed under the term loan. As previously disclosed, the Company agreed to repay this outstanding term loan amount with the net cash proceeds received from the sale of Embraco.
For additional information on the Embraco sale transaction, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Share Repurchase Program
For additional information about our share repurchase program, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sources and Uses of Cash
We met our cash needs during 2019 through cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and financing arrangements. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2019 increased $414 million compared to the same period in 2018. Our cash and cash equivalents are temporarily elevated at December 31, 2019 from commercial paper outstanding of $274 million that was subsequently repaid after year-end.
The following table summarizes the net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the periods presented. Significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2019 are discussed below:

Cash Flow Summary

---------------------------------------------------------- ------ ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- - - -----

Millions of dollars 2019 2018 2017
Cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 1,230 $ 1,229 $ 1,264
Investing activities 636 (399 ) (721 )
Financing activities (1,424 ) (518 ) (553 )
Effect of exchange rate changes (28 ) (67 ) 63
Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 414 $ 245 $ 53

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was comparable to 2018. The impact of working capital primarily includes inventory reduction efforts, credit management activities and the divestiture of the Embraco compressor business. Net earnings includes the non-cash impacts from the gain on sale and disposal of businesses.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2018 primarily reflects $350 million of discretionary pension funding, partially offset by the working capital impact from inventory reduction efforts, lower volumes and credit management activities. Net loss includes the non-cash impacts from impairment of goodwill and other intangibles.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2017 reflects effective credit management and working capital, despite lower cash earnings.
The timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels, sales patterns, promotional programs, funding requirements, credit management, as well as receivable and payment terms. Depending on the timing of cash flows, the location of cash balances, as well as the liquidity requirements of each country, external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2019 primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of the Embraco compressor business (approximately $1 billion) along with proceeds from a real estate sale-leaseback transaction (approximately $140 million) and a decrease in capital expenditures (approximately $60 million)
The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2018 primarily reflects proceeds from a real estate sale-leaseback transaction (approximately $130 million), a decrease in capital expenditures (approximately $95 million), and the proceeds related to held-to-maturity securities (approximately $60 million).
The increase in cash used in investing activities in 2017 primarily reflects the net impact of purchases (approximately $170 million) and proceeds (approximately $110 million) related to held-to-maturity securities and an increase in capital expenditures (approximately $25 million).
In June 2016, Whirlpool China Co., Ltd. ("Whirlpool China"), our majority-owned indirect subsidiary, entered into an agreement to return land use rights for land now occupied by two Whirlpool China plants in Hefei, China to a division of the Hefei municipal government.  The aggregate price for the return of land use rights was approximately RMB 687 million (approximately $103 million as of June 27, 2016). Whirlpool China received RMB 127 million (approximately $20 million) in 2018 and RMB 280 million (approximately $42 million) in 2017. The related cash flow impact from these transactions is included in investing activities in each respective year.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2019 primarily reflects higher repayments of long-term debt (increase of approximately $550 million), net effect of changes in short-term debt (increase of approximately $1.4 billion), partially offset by lower share repurchase activity (decrease of approximately $1 billion). Short-term debt reflects the activity on the $1 billion term loan that was borrowed in 2018 and repaid in 2019, offset by changes in commercial paper for funding normal working capital requirements.

37

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

The decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2018 primarily reflects higher proceeds from borrowings of short-term debt (increase of approximately $300 million) and lower repayments of long-term debt (decrease of approximately $175 million), partially offset by higher share repurchase activity (increase of approximately $400 million). We also acquired the remaining minority interest in a subsidiary.
The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 primarily reflects higher share repurchase activity (increase of approximately $225 million).
Dividends paid in financing activities approximated $300 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Financing Arrangements
The Company had total committed credit facilities of approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2019.  The facilities are geographically diverse and reflect the Company's global operations. The Company believes these facilities are sufficient to support its global operations. We had no borrowings outstanding under the committed credit facilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Dividends
In April 2019, our Board of Directors approved a 4.3% increase in our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.20 per share from $1.15 per share.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds. These agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in Brazil, as is customary under local regulations, and other governmental obligations and debt agreements. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $333 million and $355 million outstanding under these agreements, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

For additional information about our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee's expected period of employment. The determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions. Those key assumptions include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation, respectively. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense.
Our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2019 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2020 were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the sensitivity of our December 31, 2019 retirement obligations and 2020 retirement benefit costs of our United States plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results:

------------------------------------------------ ---------------- -------------------------------- -------------------

(1) Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for other postretirement benefit plans.

These sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years' financial results. Furthermore, the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results. For additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

39

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

Income Taxes
We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, general business credits and deductible temporary differences, will be realizable in future years. Realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and, where possible, considers projections of future profitability. If recovery is not more likely than not, we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, for the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. If future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made.
At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total deferred tax assets of $3.3 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $192 million and $348 million, respectively. During 2019, the Company used proceeds from a bond offering to recapitalize various entities in EMEA which resulted in a reduction in the valuation allowance. In addition, the Company has established tax planning strategies and transfer pricing policies to provide sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. Our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years. The tax expense has been influenced primarily by U.S. energy tax credits, foreign tax credits, audit settlements and adjustments, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income. Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including business profitability, tax planning strategies, and enacted tax laws.
In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 1, Note 8 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Warranty Obligations
The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized. The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold. Warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations. For additional information about warranty obligations, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles

Certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets which are not amortized. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had goodwill of approximately $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. We have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is below the carrying amount. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment.

In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible, including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible; actual and projected revenue and EBIT margin; relevant market data for both the Company and its peer companies; industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the Company's competitive position.

40

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

Significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value.

For our annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2019, the Company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment to evaluate goodwill and certain brand trademarks. The Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment on the other indefinite-lived intangible assets noting no events that indicated that the fair value was less than carrying value that would require a quantitative impairment assessment.
Goodwill Valuations

In performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate each reporting unit's fair value primarily by using the income approach. The income approach uses each reporting unit's projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. The financial projections reflect management's best estimate of economic and market conditions over the five-year projected period including forecasted revenue growth, EBIT margin, tax rate, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization and changes in working capital requirements. Other assumptions include discount rate and terminal growth rate. For one of our reporting units we use a blended approach that includes a market capitalization methodology given publicly available information and a discounted cash flow approach. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to their respective carrying values.

Additionally, we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the operating performance of each reporting unit. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting units. We also corroborate the fair value through a market capitalization reconciliation to determine whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on recent market transactions and other qualitative considerations.

Based on the results of our annual quantitative assessment performed as of October 1, 2019, the fair values of our NAR, Asia and LAR reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 139%, 253% and 27%, respectively.

Based on the quantitative assessment performed for the EMEA reporting unit, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 7%. The EMEA reporting unit has goodwill of approximately $300 million at December 31, 2019.

In evaluating the EMEA reporting unit, significant weight was provided to the forecasted EBIT margins and the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model, as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unit.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Forecasted EBIT margins are expected to recover as we stabilize volumes, improve our price/mix and recover market share and benefit from the recently announced strategic actions to rightsize and refocus the business. The 5-year average forecasted EBIT margin in the discounted cash flow model was approximately 4%.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We used a discount rate of 11.25% based on market participant assumptions.

We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 5% reduction in the projected EBIT margins in the forecasted periods would result in an impairment charge of $180 million and $49 million, respectively.

If actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, a material impairment charge of goodwill could occur, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Valuations

In performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill, primarily trademarks, we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did

41

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

not own the trademark; and a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment loss.

The fair value of the Indesit and Hotpoint* trademarks exceeded their carrying value of €190 million (approximately $213 million at December 31, 2019) and €135 million (approximately $151 million at December 31, 2019) by 16% and 7%, respectively. We expect revenue trends for both these brands to improve as we stabilize volumes, recover market share and benefit from our new product investments in the EMEA region.

The fair value of the Maytag trademark exceeded its carrying value of $1,021 million by approximately 6%. We expect revenue trends for this brand to continue to improve as we execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments.

The fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 10%.

In performing the quantitative assessment on these assets, significant assumptions used in our relief-from-royalty model included revenue growth rates, assumed royalty rates and the discount rate, which are discussed further below.

Revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our financial planning and analysis process and vary from brand to brand. Adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values noting a 10% reduction of forecasted revenues in the Hotpoint* and Maytag trademarks would result in an impairment charge of approximately $3 million and $39 million, respectively, and a 15% reduction of forecasted revenues in the Indesit trademark would result in an impairment charge of approximately $5 million.

In determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid by a market participant for the use of trademarks. The most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry, the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks, and the position of the trademarked products in the given product category. Based on this analysis, we determined a royalty rate of 3%, 3.5% and 4% for our Indesit, Hotpoint* and Maytag trademarks, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for Indesit, Hotpoint* and Maytag noting a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rates from each brand would result in an impairment charge of approximately $9 million, $27 million and $66 million, respectively.

In developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we used a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital, adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries, as applicable, as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets. Based on this analysis, we determined the discount rates to be 14.5%, 15% and 9.75% for Indesit, Hotpoint* and Maytag, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values for Maytag noting a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $57 million, and a 250 basis point increase in the discount rate for Hotpoint* and Indesit would result in an impairment charge of approximately $13 million and $7 million, respectively.

If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment charge of our trademarks could occur, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

For additional information about goodwill and indefinite-life intangible valuations, see Note 6 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas.

ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Additional information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

OTHER MATTERS
For additional information regarding certain of our loss contingencies/litigation, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Grenfell Tower
On June 23, 2017, London's Metropolitan Police Service released a statement that it had identified a Hotpoint–branded refrigerator as the initial source of the Grenfell Tower fire in West London. U.K. authorities are conducting investigations, including regarding the cause and spread of the fire. The model in question was manufactured by Indesit Company between 2006 and 2009, prior to Whirlpool's acquisition of Indesit in 2014. We are fully cooperating with the investigating authorities. Whirlpool has been named as a defendant in a product liability suit related to this matter, which suit is currently pending in Pennsylvania federal court. As these matters are ongoing, we cannot speculate on their eventual outcomes or potential impact on our financial statements; accordingly, we have not recorded any significant charges in 2018 or 2019. Additional claims may be filed related to this incident.
Antidumping and Safeguard Petition

As previously reported, Whirlpool filed petitions in 2011 and 2015 alleging that Samsung, LG and Electrolux violated U.S. and international trade laws by dumping washers into the U.S. Those petitions resulted in orders imposing antidumping duties on certain washers imported from South Korea, Mexico, and China, and countervailing duties on certain washers from South Korea. These orders could be subject to administrative reviews and possible appeals. In March 2019, the order covering certain washers from Mexico was extended for an additional five years, while the order covering certain washers from South Korea was revoked.

Whirlpool also filed a safeguard petition in May 2017 to address our concerns that Samsung and LG are evading U.S. trade laws by moving production from countries covered by antidumping orders. A safeguard remedy went into effect in February 2018, implementing tariffs on finished washers and certain covered parts for three years. During the third year of the remedy, beginning February 7, 2020, the remedy imposes a 16% tariff on the first 1.2 million large residential washing machines imported into the United States ("under tariff") and a 40% tariff on such imports in excess of 1.2 million, and also imposes a 40% tariff on washer tub, drum, and cabinet imports in excess of 90,000 units. In January 2020, the President modified the safeguard order to allocate the 1.2 million under tariff by quarter during the third year of remedy (300,000 washing machines per quarter). The President maintains discretion to modify the remedy. We cannot speculate on the modification's impact, which will depend on Samsung and LG's U.S. production capabilities and import plans.
U.S. Tariffs and Global Economy
The current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. The impact of previously-announced U.S. tariffs was a component of increased raw material costs during the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect these and other tariffs to impact material and freight costs in future quarters, which could require us to modify our current business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period.
Brexit
In 2016, the UK held a referendum, the outcome of which was an expressed public desire to exit the European Union (“Brexit”), which has resulted in greater uncertainty related to the free movement of goods, services, people and capital between the UK and the EU. On January 31, 2020, the UK officially exited the European Union and entered into a transition period to negotiate the final terms of Brexit. Many potential future impacts of Brexit remain unclear and could adversely impact certain areas of our business, including, but not limited to, an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of products, and adverse impacts to our suppliers and financing institutions. In order to mitigate the risks associated

43

with Brexit, we are preparing for potential adverse impacts by collaborating across Company functions and working with external partners to develop and revise the necessary contingency plans.

Among these factors are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers, and the impact of the changing retail environment, including direct-to-consumer sales; (2) Whirlpool's ability to maintain or increase sales to significant trade customers and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (3) Whirlpool's ability to maintain its reputation and brand image; (4) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, productivity improvements, and cost control objectives, and to leverage its global operating platform, and accelerate the rate of innovation; (5) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (6) acquisition and investment-related risks, including risks associated with our past acquisitions, and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets; (7) risks related to our international operations, including changes in foreign regulations, regulatory compliance and disruptions arising from political, legal and economic instability; (8) information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network disruptions, and cybersecurity attacks; (9) product liability and product recall costs; (10) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (11) our ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees; (12) the impact of labor relations; (13) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel, resins, copper and aluminum) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (14) Whirlpool's ability to manage foreign currency fluctuations; (15) impacts from goodwill impairment and related charges; (16) triggering events or circumstances impacting the carrying value of our long-lived assets; (17) inventory and other asset risk; (18) the uncertain global economy and changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products; (19) health care cost trends, regulatory changes and variations between results and estimates that could increase future funding obligations for pension and postretirement benefit plans; (20) changes in LIBOR, or replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; (21) litigation, tax, and legal compliance risk and costs, especially if materially different from the amount we expect to incur or have accrued for, and any disruptions caused by the same; (22) the effects and costs of governmental investigations or related actions by third parties; and (23) changes in the legal and regulatory environment including environmental, health and safety regulations, and taxes and tariffs.
We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, and investors are advised to review disclosures in our filings with the SEC. It is not possible to foresee or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. Therefore, investors should not consider the foregoing factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties, or factors that could potentially cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flow Hedges In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of November 29, 2019, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our ant...

(4) Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes, excluding transaction and integration expenses and special charges, or $840.0 million, $780.1 million, and $694.1 million for the years ended November 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 32 ------------------------------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------------- Estimate for the year ending November 30, 2020 Earnings per share - diluted $5.15 to $5.25 Impact of special charges 0.05 Adjusted earnings per share - diluted $5.20 to $5.30 Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchan...

Note 11.Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations.

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange.

['S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This Management Discussion and Analysis should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Financial Data included in this Form 10-K. Certain references to particular information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are made to assist readers.

OVERVIEW

Whirlpool had full-year GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool of $1.2 billion (net earnings margin of 5.8%), or $18.45 per share, compared to GAAP net loss available to Whirlpool of $183 million (net earnings margin of (0.9)%), or $(2.72) per share in the same prior-year period. On a GAAP basis, net earnings were favorably impacted by the gain on the sale of our Embraco compressor business of approximately $511 million, partially offset by product warranty and liability expense of approximately $131 million and losses associated with strategic actions executed in EMEA of approximately $74 million. In the same prior-year period, non-recurring items negatively impacted net earnings available to Whirlpool by approximately $850 million. Solid cash provided by operating activities of $1.2 billion was driven by higher earnings and working capital improvement.

Whirlpool delivered ongoing (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $16.00 and full-year ongoing EBIT margin of 6.9%, compared to 6.3% in the same prior-year period. These results were driven by positive price/mix and strong cost discipline, which were partially offset by cost inflation, increased brand investments and currency. In addition, we delivered strong free cash flow (non-GAAP) of $912 million, primarily driven by working capital improvement and lower capital expenditures. Lastly, we strengthened our balance sheet and made strong progress toward our long-term Gross Debt to EBITDA target of approximately 2.0.

We are very pleased with the successful execution of our strong price-mix actions driven by new product introductions and cost-based price increases and targeted cost takeout. In addition, the strong actions to restore profitability in EMEA resulted in approximately $75 million of EBIT improvement compared to the prior-year.

We are committed to generating margin expansion and strong cash flow and are confident that our actions will drive positive results in 2020 as outlined in our long-term value creation strategy.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us, such as reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and adopting a territorial tax system. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 22.2%. This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income,...

Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2019 is comparable to 2018. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2018 increased compared to 2017 due to expenses related to the bad debt expense from a Brazilian retailer, expenses related to the sale of the Embraco compressor business and the negative impact of unit volume declines.

Restructuring
We incurred restructuring charges of $188 million, $247 million and $275 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the full year 2020, we expect to incur up to $100 million of restructuring charges, driven by previously announced fixed cost reduction actions in the EMEA region.
See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles

We recorded an impairment charge of $747 million related to goodwill ($579 million) and other intangibles ($168 million) for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the EMEA reporting unit.

Interest Expense
Interest expense was $187 million, $192 million and $162 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense in 2019 was comparable to 2018. During 2018, interest expense increased by $30 million compared to 2017. This was primarily due to higher average debt and notes payable balances and higher average interest rates.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $354 million, $138 million and $550 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in tax expense in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to higher earnings before tax, reduced foreign tax credits and the sale of Embraco, partially offset by net reductions in valuation allowances, and impacts from a statutory legal entity merger.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying the maturity structure, we avoid concentrations of debt, reducing liquidity risk. We have varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business. We regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities, which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives, funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities, providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions.
Our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending, restructuring activities, and returns to shareholders. We also have $559 million of term debt maturing in the next twelve months, and are currently evaluating our options in connection with this maturing debt, which may include repayment through refinancing, free cash flow generation, or cash on hand.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2019, of which the significant majority was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries. Our cash and cash equivalents are temporarily elevated as of December 31, 2019 from commercial paper outstanding of $274 million that was subsequently repaid after year-end. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries']:

Sources and Uses of Cash
We met our cash needs during 2019 through cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and financing arrangements. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2019 increased $414 million compared to the same period in 2018. Our cash and cash equivalents are temporarily elevated at December 31, 2019 from commercial paper outstanding of $274 million that was subsequently repaid after year-end.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee']:

[' operational activities and expected future foreign investments. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (if any) and withholding taxes payable to various countries. It is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation.
At December 31, 2019, we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in China, Brazil, the United States and India, which represented 2.5%, 2.0%, 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively. In addition, we did not have any third-party accounts receivable greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of the United States. We continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally.
Notes payable consists of short-term borrowings payable to banks and commercial paper, which are generally used to fund working capital requirements. At December 31, 2019, we had $294 million of notes payable outstanding which primarily included $274 million of commercial paper. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
We monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending, depository, derivative counterparty banks and customers regularly, and take certain action to manage credit risk. We diversify our deposits and investments in short-term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds. These agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in Brazil, as is customary under local regulations, and other governmental obligations and debt agreements.

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange.

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flow Hedges In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of November 29, 2019, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance.
