Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

– COVID-19 Pandemic,” will help mitigate the impact that reduced revenues may have on its fiscal 2021 operating results. The Company intends to continue to monitor the situation and may extend these actions if necessary.

As of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact the Company's financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations is uncertain.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of receivables, realizability of inventory, property and equipment, goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, other investments, accrued expenses, stock-based compensation, income taxes including deferred tax assets and liabilities, contingencies and litigation. Provisions for depreciation are based on their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Some of these estimates can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

The Company classifies any marketable security with an original maturity date of 90 days or less at the time of purchase as a cash equivalent. Cash equivalents are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value. The Company classifies any marketable security with a maturity date of greater than 90 days at the time of purchase as marketable securities and classifies marketable securities with a maturity date of greater than one year from the balance sheet date as long-term marketable securities.

The Company’s marketable securities, consisting of U.S. Treasury securities, government-back securities, corporate debt securities, and commercial paper, are classified as available-for-sale securities and, accordingly, are recorded at fair value. The difference between amortized cost and fair value is included in stockholders’ equity. Marketable securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity marketable securities. If the Company does not have the intent and ability to hold a marketable security to maturity, it reports the investment as available-for-sale marketable securities. The Company includes unrealized gains and, to the extent deemed temporary, unrealized losses in stockholders’ equity. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers available evidence to evaluate whether the decline is “other than temporary” and, if so, marks the marketable security to market through a charge reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.

Major Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company primarily sells its products to hospitals and distributors. No customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. No individual customer had an accounts receivable balance greater than 10% of total accounts receivable at March 31, 2020 and 2019.

Credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer’s historical financial condition and generally collateral is not required. The Company’s history of credit losses has not been significant and the Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. Accounts receivables are geographically dispersed, primarily throughout the U.S., as well as in Europe and other foreign countries where formal distributor agreements exist in certain countries. The Company's exposure to credit losses may increase if its customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage, and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty associated with local or global economic recessions, disruption associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, or other customer-specific factors. Although the Company has historically not experienced significant credit losses, it is possible that there could be a material adverse impact from potential adjustments of the carrying amount of trade receivables as hospital's cash flows are impacted by their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, short and long-term marketable securities and accounts receivable. Management mitigates credit risk by limiting the investment type and maturity to securities that preserve capital, maintain liquidity and have a high credit quality.

Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and contingent consideration. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered reasonable estimates of their fair value, due to the short maturity of these investments.

Derivative Instruments

The Company uses a foreign-exchange-related derivative instrument to manage its exposure related to changes in the exchange rate on its intercompany loan. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap designated as a hedging instrument that effectively offsets the variability of cash flows are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. These amounts subsequently are reclassified into the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the related hedged item affects earnings. For more information, see “Note 4. Financial Instruments—Derivative Instruments.”

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is based on the first in, first out method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and writes down to its net realizable value any inventory that it believes to be impaired. Management considers forecast demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is not written back up if demand increases.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is carried at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of three to five years for machinery and equipment, computer software, and furniture and fixtures. Building and building improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of seven to thirty-three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses.

Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved and other valuation techniques.

Other Investments

The Company periodically makes investments in medical device companies that focus on heart failure and heart pumps and other medical device technologies. For investments in convertible debt or preferred stock securities that do not have readily determinable market values, the Company measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment. The Company monitors any events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant effect on the fair value of investments, either due to impairment or based on observable price changes, and makes any necessary adjustments.

Leases

On April 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” This new guidance required that the Company’s lease commitments to be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, which increased total assets and total liabilities that the Company reported on its consolidated balance sheet. For a discussion on the impact of this accounting policy adoption, including key accounting policies and elections, see “Note 9. Leases.”

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded when consideration for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually at October 31, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company’s products and services, regulatory and political developments, cost factors, and entity specific factors such as strategies and overall financial performance. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing a two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step is a comparison of the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. If the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further procedures are required. However, if the reporting unit’s fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment of goodwill may exist, requiring a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit.

The Company performed a qualitative assessment during its annual impairment review for fiscal 2020 as of October 31, 2019 and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit is not less than its carrying amount. Therefore, the two-step goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit was not necessary in fiscal 2020.

In-Process Research and Development

In-process research and development, or IPR&D, assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. IPR&D assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies that are acquired, which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. During the period that the IPR&D assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 31, or more frequently if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the IPR&D assets are less than their carrying values. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs upon regulatory approval and the Company is able to commercialize products associated with the IPR&D assets, these assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If development is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have a full or partial impairment charge related to the IPR&D assets, calculated as the excess of carrying value of the IPR&D assets over fair value. The Company performed its annual impairment review for fiscal 2020 as of October 31, 2019 and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D assets is not less than its carrying value.

Contingent Consideration

Contingent consideration represents potential milestones that the Company could pay additional consideration for a business acquisition and is recorded as a liability and is measured at fair value using a combination of (1) an income approach, based on various revenue and cost assumptions and applying a probability to each outcome and (2) a Monte-Carlo valuation model that simulates outcomes based on management estimates. With the income approach, probabilities were applied to each potential scenario and the resulting values were discounted using a rate that considers the weighted average cost of capital, the related projections, and the overall business. The Monte-Carlo valuation model simulates estimated future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success or changes in expected timelines for achievement of any of these milestones could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of the contingent consideration liability. The fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting date is updated by reflecting the changes in fair value reflected within research and development expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

Accrued Expenses

As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate accrued expenses. This process includes identifying services that third parties have performed and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in its financial statements. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include estimates for certain payroll costs, such as bonuses and commissions; contract service fees, such as amounts due to clinical research organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials; professional service fees, such as attorneys and accountants, and third-party expenses relating to marketing efforts associated with commercialization of the Company’s products. The dates in which certain services commence and end, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of services is often subject to the Company’s judgment. The Company makes these judgments and estimates based upon known facts and circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

On April 1, 2018 the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 (“Topic 606”), “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.’ For a discussion on the impact of this accounting policy adoption, including key accounting policies and elections, see “Note 3. Revenue Recognition.”

Product Warranty

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty for certain products sold in which estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded as an expense at the time of shipment. The Company’s products are subject to regulatory and quality standards. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical product performance rates and related costs to repair given products. The accounting estimate related to product warranty expense involves judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs. Should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income, plus all changes in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including any foreign currency translation adjustments. These changes in equity are recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consist of foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities and any unrealized gains or losses from derivative instruments.  There were no reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The cumulative translation effect for subsidiaries using a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company’s intercompany accounts are denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany transactions that the Company considers to be of a long-term investment nature are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, while gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany transactions from those foreign subsidiaries for which the Company anticipates settlement in the foreseeable future are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The net foreign currency translation gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not significant.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted net income per share is computed using the treasury stock method by dividing net income by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated by adding to the weighted average shares outstanding any potential dilutive securities outstanding for the fiscal year. Potential dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based stock awards and shares to be purchased under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s basic and diluted net income per share were as follows (figures in tables are in thousands, except per share data):

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
------------------------------- ---------------------------- ------- - ------- - -------
Basic Net Income Per Share 2020 2019 2018
Net income $ 203,009 $ 259,016 $ 112,170

Weighted average shares - basic 45,179 44,911 44,153

Net income per share - basic $ 4.49 $ 5.77 $ 2.54

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
--------------------------------- ---------------------------- ------- - ------- - -------
Diluted Net Income Per Share 2020 2019 2018
Net income $ 203,009 $ 259,016 $ 112,170

Weighted average shares - basic 45,179 44,911 44,153
Effect of dilutive securities 637 1,240 1,696
Weighted average shares - diluted 45,816 46,151 45,849

Net income per share - diluted $ 4.43 $ 5.61 $ 2.45

For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 232,000, 64,000 and 155,000 shares of common stock underlying outstanding securities related to out-of-the-money stock options and performance-based awards where milestones were not met were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period.

The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of the valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company estimates the expected term of options based on historical exercise experience and estimates of future exercises of unexercised options. In addition, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because the Company does not pay cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures that are expected to occur. An accounting policy change was made by the Company related to the recording of forfeitures in fiscal 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (“Topic 718”): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” discussed further below.

For awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and performance-based conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period. Estimates of stock-based compensation expense for an award with performance conditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. The cumulative effect of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and deferred provision. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on income tax returns for the current fiscal year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future income tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years as the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to impact taxable income.

The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit at the largest amount that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis, when applicable. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, new information and technical insights, and changes in tax laws. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Refer to “Note 12. Income Taxes” for further information related to the Tax Reform Act and its impact on the Company’s financial statements.  When applicable, the Company accrues for the effects of uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest through income tax expense.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) standard update ASU 2016-02 “Leases,” which requires lessees to identify arrangements that should be accounted for as leases. Under this guidance, for lease arrangements exceeding a one-year term, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation is recorded by the lessee for all leases on the balance sheet, whether operating or financing, while the statement of operations includes lease expense for operating leases and amortization and interest expense for financing leases. ASU 2016-02 was adopted using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or entered into after the April 1, 2019. Additional information and disclosures required by this new standard are contained in “Note 9. Leases.”

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326).” This guidance will require financial instruments to be measured at amortized cost, and accounts receivables to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The new model requires an entity to estimate credit losses based on historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-13 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).” This guidance simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which required companies to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill and recognize an impairment charge by the amount in which the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value. Under the new guidance, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded, even if the difference is attributable to the fair value of other assets in the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-04 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820).” which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The Company has investments accounted for and disclosed under Topic 820 and will modify disclosures as applicable to conform with the new guidance. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard and the required disclosure changes to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-13 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740).”   This amendment to the guidance on income taxes is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The amendment eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The amendment also clarifies existing guidance related to the evaluation of a step up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in the effective tax rate computation, among other clarifications. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2019-12 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2022.

In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, “Investments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815),” an amendment clarifying the interaction between accounting standards related to equity securities, equity method investments, and certain derivative instruments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. ASU 2020-01 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2022.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

COVID-19 Pandemic

The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the pandemic is developing and information is rapidly evolving. In recent months, a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has spread to many countries around the world and the outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services has also declared a public health emergency in the U.S. in response to the outbreak. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the COVID-19 virus and its potential effects, and the extent of and effectiveness of responses taken on international, national and local levels. Measures taken to limit the impact of COVID-19, including shelter-in-place orders, social distancing measures, travel bans and restrictions, and business and government shutdowns, have already created significant negative economic impacts on a global basis.

Due to these impacts and measures, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for its products as healthcare customers divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, the Company’s customers may delay, cancel, or redirect planned purchases in order to focus resources on COVID-19 or in response to economic disruption related to COVID-19. For example, beginning in mid-March 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company experienced a significant decline in patient utilization in the U.S. and Europe, as healthcare systems diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19. In addition, public health bodies have recommended delaying elective medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may continue to negatively impact the usage of the Company’s products, including the number of Impella heart pump procedures. The Company may also experience delays in clinical trial enrollment or encounter interruption or delays in the operations of FDA or other regulatory authorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact review and approval timelines. At the end of March 2020, the Company temporarily paused new enrollments in its active clinical trials in response to the COVID-19 response around the globe. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact on its customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.

While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, the Company expects that its revenues, operating results and operating cash flows for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 will be materially adversely impacted. The Company currently expects to see sequential quarterly improvement in the remainder of fiscal 2021 as elective medical procedures are expected to be rescheduled. Further cancellations or delays could materially adversely impact the Company’s revenues and financial results. The Company cannot predict when elective medical procedures will resume or when symptomatic patients will return to the hospital or if its access to hospital sites will be limited, but the Company believes that the implementation of the cost reduction efforts that it has imposed, as discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

– COVID-19 Pandemic,” will help mitigate the impact that reduced revenues may have on its fiscal 2021 operating results. The Company intends to continue to monitor the situation and may extend these actions if necessary.

As of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact the Company's financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations is uncertain.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of receivables, realizability of inventory, property and equipment, goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, other investments, accrued expenses, stock-based compensation, income taxes including deferred tax assets and liabilities, contingencies and litigation. Provisions for depreciation are based on their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Some of these estimates can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

The Company classifies any marketable security with an original maturity date of 90 days or less at the time of purchase as a cash equivalent. Cash equivalents are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value. The Company classifies any marketable security with a maturity date of greater than 90 days at the time of purchase as marketable securities and classifies marketable securities with a maturity date of greater than one year from the balance sheet date as long-term marketable securities.

The Company’s marketable securities, consisting of U.S. Treasury securities, government-back securities, corporate debt securities, and commercial paper, are classified as available-for-sale securities and, accordingly, are recorded at fair value. The difference between amortized cost and fair value is included in stockholders’ equity. Marketable securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity marketable securities. If the Company does not have the intent and ability to hold a marketable security to maturity, it reports the investment as available-for-sale marketable securities. The Company includes unrealized gains and, to the extent deemed temporary, unrealized losses in stockholders’ equity. If any adjustment to fair value reflects a decline in the value of the investment, the Company considers available evidence to evaluate whether the decline is “other than temporary” and, if so, marks the marketable security to market through a charge reflected on the consolidated statements of operations.

Major Customers and Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company primarily sells its products to hospitals and distributors. No customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. No individual customer had an accounts receivable balance greater than 10% of total accounts receivable at March 31, 2020 and 2019.

Credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer’s historical financial condition and generally collateral is not required. The Company’s history of credit losses has not been significant and the Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. Accounts receivables are geographically dispersed, primarily throughout the U.S., as well as in Europe and other foreign countries where formal distributor agreements exist in certain countries. The Company's exposure to credit losses may increase if its customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage, and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty associated with local or global economic recessions, disruption associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, or other customer-specific factors. Although the Company has historically not experienced significant credit losses, it is possible that there could be a material adverse impact from potential adjustments of the carrying amount of trade receivables as hospital's cash flows are impacted by their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, short and long-term marketable securities and accounts receivable. Management mitigates credit risk by limiting the investment type and maturity to securities that preserve capital, maintain liquidity and have a high credit quality.

Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and contingent consideration. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered reasonable estimates of their fair value, due to the short maturity of these investments.

Derivative Instruments

The Company uses a foreign-exchange-related derivative instrument to manage its exposure related to changes in the exchange rate on its intercompany loan. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap designated as a hedging instrument that effectively offsets the variability of cash flows are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. These amounts subsequently are reclassified into the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the related hedged item affects earnings. For more information, see “Note 4. Financial Instruments—Derivative Instruments.”

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is based on the first in, first out method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and writes down to its net realizable value any inventory that it believes to be impaired. Management considers forecast demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is not written back up if demand increases.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is carried at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of three to five years for machinery and equipment, computer software, and furniture and fixtures. Building and building improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of seven to thirty-three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses.

Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved and other valuation techniques.

Other Investments

The Company periodically makes investments in medical device companies that focus on heart failure and heart pumps and other medical device technologies. For investments in convertible debt or preferred stock securities that do not have readily determinable market values, the Company measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment. The Company monitors any events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant effect on the fair value of investments, either due to impairment or based on observable price changes, and makes any necessary adjustments.

Leases

On April 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” This new guidance required that the Company’s lease commitments to be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, which increased total assets and total liabilities that the Company reported on its consolidated balance sheet. For a discussion on the impact of this accounting policy adoption, including key accounting policies and elections, see “Note 9. Leases.”

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded when consideration for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually at October 31, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company’s products and services, regulatory and political developments, cost factors, and entity specific factors such as strategies and overall financial performance. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing a two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step is a comparison of the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. If the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further procedures are required. However, if the reporting unit’s fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment of goodwill may exist, requiring a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit.

The Company performed a qualitative assessment during its annual impairment review for fiscal 2020 as of October 31, 2019 and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit is not less than its carrying amount. Therefore, the two-step goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit was not necessary in fiscal 2020.

In-Process Research and Development

In-process research and development, or IPR&D, assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. IPR&D assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies that are acquired, which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. During the period that the IPR&D assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 31, or more frequently if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the IPR&D assets are less than their carrying values. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs upon regulatory approval and the Company is able to commercialize products associated with the IPR&D assets, these assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If development is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have a full or partial impairment charge related to the IPR&D assets, calculated as the excess of carrying value of the IPR&D assets over fair value. The Company performed its annual impairment review for fiscal 2020 as of October 31, 2019 and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D assets is not less than its carrying value.

Contingent Consideration

Contingent consideration represents potential milestones that the Company could pay additional consideration for a business acquisition and is recorded as a liability and is measured at fair value using a combination of (1) an income approach, based on various revenue and cost assumptions and applying a probability to each outcome and (2) a Monte-Carlo valuation model that simulates outcomes based on management estimates. With the income approach, probabilities were applied to each potential scenario and the resulting values were discounted using a rate that considers the weighted average cost of capital, the related projections, and the overall business. The Monte-Carlo valuation model simulates estimated future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success or changes in expected timelines for achievement of any of these milestones could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of the contingent consideration liability. The fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting date is updated by reflecting the changes in fair value reflected within research and development expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

Accrued Expenses

As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate accrued expenses. This process includes identifying services that third parties have performed and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in its financial statements. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include estimates for certain payroll costs, such as bonuses and commissions; contract service fees, such as amounts due to clinical research organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials; professional service fees, such as attorneys and accountants, and third-party expenses relating to marketing efforts associated with commercialization of the Company’s products. The dates in which certain services commence and end, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of services is often subject to the Company’s judgment. The Company makes these judgments and estimates based upon known facts and circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

On April 1, 2018 the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 (“Topic 606”), “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.’ For a discussion on the impact of this accounting policy adoption, including key accounting policies and elections, see “Note 3. Revenue Recognition.”

Product Warranty

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty for certain products sold in which estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded as an expense at the time of shipment. The Company’s products are subject to regulatory and quality standards. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical product performance rates and related costs to repair given products. The accounting estimate related to product warranty expense involves judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs. Should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income, plus all changes in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including any foreign currency translation adjustments. These changes in equity are recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consist of foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities and any unrealized gains or losses from derivative instruments.  There were no reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The cumulative translation effect for subsidiaries using a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company’s intercompany accounts are denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany transactions that the Company considers to be of a long-term investment nature are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, while gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany transactions from those foreign subsidiaries for which the Company anticipates settlement in the foreseeable future are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The net foreign currency translation gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not significant.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted net income per share is computed using the treasury stock method by dividing net income by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated by adding to the weighted average shares outstanding any potential dilutive securities outstanding for the fiscal year. Potential dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based stock awards and shares to be purchased under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s basic and diluted net income per share were as follows (figures in tables are in thousands, except per share data):

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
------------------------------- ---------------------------- ------- - ------- - -------
Basic Net Income Per Share 2020 2019 2018

Net income per share - diluted $ 4.43 $ 5.61 $ 2.45

For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 232,000, 64,000 and 155,000 shares of common stock underlying outstanding securities related to out-of-the-money stock options and performance-based awards where milestones were not met were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period.

The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of the valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company estimates the expected term of options based on historical exercise experience and estimates of future exercises of unexercised options. In addition, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because the Company does not pay cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures that are expected to occur. An accounting policy change was made by the Company related to the recording of forfeitures in fiscal 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (“Topic 718”): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” discussed further below.

For awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and performance-based conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period. Estimates of stock-based compensation expense for an award with performance conditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. The cumulative effect of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and deferred provision. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on income tax returns for the current fiscal year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future income tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years as the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to impact taxable income.

The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit at the largest amount that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis, when applicable. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, new information and technical insights, and changes in tax laws. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Refer to “Note 12. Income Taxes” for further information related to the Tax Reform Act and its impact on the Company’s financial statements.  When applicable, the Company accrues for the effects of uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest through income tax expense.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) standard update ASU 2016-02 “Leases,” which requires lessees to identify arrangements that should be accounted for as leases. Under this guidance, for lease arrangements exceeding a one-year term, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation is recorded by the lessee for all leases on the balance sheet, whether operating or financing, while the statement of operations includes lease expense for operating leases and amortization and interest expense for financing leases. ASU 2016-02 was adopted using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or entered into after the April 1, 2019. Additional information and disclosures required by this new standard are contained in “Note 9. Leases.”

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326).” This guidance will require financial instruments to be measured at amortized cost, and accounts receivables to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The new model requires an entity to estimate credit losses based on historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-13 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).” This guidance simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which required companies to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill and recognize an impairment charge by the amount in which the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value. Under the new guidance, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded, even if the difference is attributable to the fair value of other assets in the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-04 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820).” which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The Company has investments accounted for and disclosed under Topic 820 and will modify disclosures as applicable to conform with the new guidance. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard and the required disclosure changes to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-13 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740).”   This amendment to the guidance on income taxes is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The amendment eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The amendment also clarifies existing guidance related to the evaluation of a step up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in the effective tax rate computation, among other clarifications. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2019-12 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2022.

In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, “Investments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815),” an amendment clarifying the interaction between accounting standards related to equity securities, equity method investments, and certain derivative instruments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. ASU 2020-01 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2022.

Note 3. Revenue Recognition

Adoption of Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”

The Company adopted Topic 606 on April 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method for all revenue contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 reflect the application of Topic 606 guidance while the reported results for fiscal year 2018 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition.” The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the timing or amount of revenue recognized upon adoption and there was no cumulative prior period adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption. Accordingly, the adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations, stockholders’ equity or cash flows.

The Company has made the following accounting policy elections and elected to use certain practical expedients, as permitted by the FASB, in applying Topic 606: (1) the Company accounts for amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes, net of related amounts remitted to tax authorities; (2) the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because, at contract inception, the Company expects the period between the time when the Company transfers a promised good or service to the customer and the time when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less; (3) the Company expenses costs to obtain a contract as they are incurred if the expected period of benefit, and therefore the amortization period, is one year or less; (4) the Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after control transfers to the customer as a fulfillment cost rather than an additional promised service and these fulfillment costs are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses; (5) the Company does not assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer; and (6) the Company does not disclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the original expected contract duration is one year or less.

The Company generates product revenue from the sale of Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella 5.5, Impella RP and Impella AIC products and related accessories. The Company also earns revenue from preventative maintenance service contracts and maintenance calls.

The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:

 • Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer

 • Identification of the performance obligation in the contract

 • Determination of the transaction price

 • Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract

 • Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied

Identification of contracts and performance obligations

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is an approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. The Company's performance obligations consist mainly of transferring control of products and services identified in the contracts, purchase orders or invoices. For each contract, the Company considers the obligation to transfer products and services to the customer, each of which are distinct, to be performance obligations.

Transaction price and allocation to performance obligations

Transaction prices of products or services are typically based on contracted rates with customers and there is only variable consideration in limited instances. To the extent that the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing the expected value method or the most likely amount, depending on the circumstances, to which the Company expects to be entitled. An expected value method may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if an entity has a large number of contracts with similar characteristics whereas the most likely amount method may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable consideration if the contract has only two possible outcomes. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur.  Estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company’s anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available.  Sales and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue.

Consistent with industry practice, the Company generally offers customers a limited right of return for its products. Product returns are typically not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless there are product errors or the product is damaged at time of receipt. Customers typically have a limited time frame to notify the Company of any defective or non-conforming products. The Company’s limited warranty provision is accounted for using the cost accrual method and is recognized as expense when products are sold and is not considered a separate performance obligation.

If a contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised products or services underlying each performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when, or as, obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised products or services is transferred to customers.  Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring products or services to a customer.

Product revenue is generally recognized when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product, which occurs at a point in time, and may be upon shipment or upon delivery based on the contractual shipping terms of a contract.

Service revenue is generally recognized over time as the services are rendered to the customer based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company recognizes service revenue over the term of the service contract. Services are expected to be transferred to the customer throughout the term of the contract and the Company believes recognizing revenue ratably over the term of the contract best depicts the transfer of value to the customer. Revenue generated from preventative maintenance calls is recognized at a point in time when the services are provided to the customer.

Revenue from the sale of products and services are evidenced by either a contract with the customer or a valid purchase order and an invoice which includes all relevant terms of sale and shipment of product or service provided has been incurred. The Company performs a review of each specific customer's credit worthiness and ability to pay prior to acceptance as a customer. Further, the Company performs periodic reviews of its customers' creditworthiness prospectively.

Disaggregation of Revenue

The Company generally sells its Impella products and services through a direct sales force in the U.S., Germany and Japan and through direct sales and distribution agreements in other international markets outside (e.g., Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific, Middle East). Revenue is disaggregated from contracts between product revenue and service and other revenue and by geography, which the Company believes best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by products and services:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
------------------------- ---------------------------- ------- - ------- - -------
 2020 2019 2018
 (in $000's)
Impella product revenue $ 806,824 $ 741,699 $ 570,870
Service and other revenue 34,059 27,733 22,879
Total revenue $ 840,883 $ 769,432 $ 593,749

The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by geographical location:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
--------------------- ---------------------------- ------- - ------- - -------
 2020 2019 2018
 (in $000's)
U.S. revenue $ 705,409 $ 665,082 $ 526,685
International revenue 135,474 104,350 67,064
Total revenue $ 840,883 $ 769,432 $ 593,749

Variable Consideration

Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from discounts or rebates that are offered within contracts between the Company and its customers relating to the Company’s sales of its products. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or are expected to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as a liability. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration relevant factors such as the Company’s historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. These reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contract. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company’s estimates.  If actual results in the future vary from the Company’s estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.

Returns Reserve

The Company estimates an allowance for future sales returns based on historical return experience, which requires judgment. The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned by its customers and records this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized.  The Company estimates product return liabilities using the expected value method based on its historical sales information and other factors that it believes could significantly impact its expected returns, including product discontinuations, product recalls and expirations, of which it becomes aware.  The Company’s cost of replacing defective products has not been material and is accounted for at the time of replacement. The Company’s returns reserve was $0.6 million and $0 as of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, respectively.

Rebates and Discounts

The Company provides certain customers with rebates and discounts that are defined in the Company’s contract arrangements with customers and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction to revenue and the establishment of a liability, which are all included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rebates normally result from performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes as well as product usage.  Discounts are normally from early payment incentives. The Company estimates the amounts of rebates and discounts based on an estimate of the third-party’s sales and the respective rebate or discount defined in the customer contractual arrangement.

Contract Balances

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in accounts receivables and deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet. A receivable is recognized in the period the Company’s right to the consideration from the customer is unconditional. The change in the accounts receivable balances relate to the timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. The Company generally does not have any performance obligations with a term of more than one year.
Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 30 to 60 days for direct sales customers. Payment terms with certain international distributors can be up to 90 days. The Company’s contracts with customers do not typically include extended payment terms.

Deferred Revenue

When consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract, deferred revenue is recorded. Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue after control of the products or services is transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

The Company’s deferred revenue balance was $19.1 million and $16.4 million as of March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The deferred revenue balance is comprised of product shipments in which the Company recognizes revenue when the customer obtains control of the product, and preventative maintenance service contracts in which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the service contract. During the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recognized $15.6 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2019.  During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company recognized $14.9 million of revenue that was included in the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2018.

Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Customer Contract

The Company has certain costs to obtain and fulfill a customer contract, such as commissions and shipping costs. The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products. These costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Derivative Instruments

In October 2019, the Company entered into an intercompany agreement in which it loaned 85.0 million Euro to Abiomed Europe GMBH, its German subsidiary.  In conjunction with this intercompany loan agreement, the Company entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to convert a notional amount of 85.0 million Euro equivalent to $93.5 million denominated intercompany loan into U.S. dollars. The objective of this cross-currency swap is to hedge the variability of cash flows related to the forecasted interest and principal payments on the Euro denominated fixed rate loan against changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Euro. Under the terms of this cross-currency swap contract, which has been designated as a cash flow hedge, the Company will make interest payments in Euro and receive interest in U.S. dollars. Upon the maturity of this contract, the Company will pay the principal amount of the loan in Euro and receive U.S. dollars from the counterparty. The cross-currency swap is carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value, and changes in the fair values are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The Company uses a foreign-exchange-related derivative instrument to manage its exposure related to changes in the exchange rate on its intercompany loan. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging.

The following table summarizes the terms of the cross-currency swap agreement as of March 31, 2020 (dollar amounts in thousands):

------------- -------------- ----------- ---------- ------------------------------------- ----------
 Effective Date Maturity Fixed Rate Aggregate Notional Amount (in $000's)
Pay EUR October 15, October 15, 2.75% EUR 85,000
Receive U.S.$ 2019 2024 4.64% USD 93,457

The following table presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative instrument as of March 31, 2020:

----------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------ --------------------- -----
Derivatives designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 Balance Sheet classification Fair Value (in$000's)
Cross-currency swap Other assets (long-term liabilities) $ 3,786

The Company has structured its cross-currency swap agreement to be 100% effective and, as a result, there was no net impact to earnings resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap are designated as a hedging instrument that effectively offsets the variability of cash flows are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These amounts subsequently are reclassified into the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the related hedged item affects earnings.

For the year ended March 31, 2020, the Company recorded an income of $0.8 million in other (expense) income, net, included in the consolidated statements of operations related to the interest rate differential of the cross-currency swaps.

Contingent Consideration

The Company’s financial liabilities consisted of contingent consideration potentially payable related to the acquisition of ECP Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH, or ECP, and AIS GmbH Aachen Innovative Solutions, or AIS, in July 2014. The Company acquired ECP and AIS for $13.0 million in cash, with additional potential payouts totaling $15.0 million based on the achievement of CE Mark approval in the European Union and a revenue-based milestone related to the development of the future Impella ECP™ expandable catheter pump technology. These potential milestone payments may be made, at the Company’s option, by a combination of cash or ABIOMED common stock. As of March 31, 2020, the Company used a combination of an income approach, based on various revenue and cost assumptions and applying a probability to each outcome and a Monte-Carlo valuation model. For the clinical and regulatory milestone, probabilities were applied to each potential scenario and the resulting values were discounted using a rate that considers weighted average cost of capital as well as a specific risk premium associated with the riskiness of the Earn-out itself, the related projections, and the overall business. The revenue-based milestone is valued using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, which simulates estimated future revenues during the earn out-period using management's best estimates. Projected revenues are based on the Company’s most recent internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans.

Fair Value Hierarchy

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.

Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose values are based on quoted market prices such as exchange-traded instruments and listed equities.

Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curve, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity, current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.

Level 3 is comprised of unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flows or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

The following table presents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for its financial instruments measured at fair value as of March 31, 2020 and 2019:

The Company has determined that the estimated fair value of its money market funds and its investment in Shockwave Medical should be reported as Level 1 financial assets as they are valued at quoted market prices in active markets. The investment in Shockwave Medical is classified within other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and is further discussed in “Note 8. Goodwill, In-Process Research & Development and Other Assets.”

The Company has determined that the estimated fair value of its repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury securities, government-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper and cross currency agreement are reported as Level 2 financial assets as they are based on model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable, or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset.

The contingent consideration liability is reported as Level 3 as the estimated fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation and is calculated using the following valuation methods:

--------------------------------- ----------------- ------ ---------------------------- - ----- --------------------- ------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Milestone Payment Fair Value at March 31, 2020 Valuation Methodology Significant Unobservable Input Weighted Average (range, if applicable)
 (in $000's)
Clinical and regulatory milestone $ 7,000 $ 5,362 Probability weighted income approach Projected fiscal year of milestone payments 2022 to 2024
 Discount rate 3.72% to 3.90%
 Probability of occurrence Probability adjusted level of 40% for the base case scenario and 5% to 40% for various downside and upside scenarios

Revenue-based milestone 8,000 3,638 Monte Carlo simulation model Projected fiscal year of milestone payments 2026 to 2035
 Discount rate 15%
 Expected volatility for forecasted revenues 50%
 Probability of payment (risk-neutral) 62.7%
 $ 15,000 $ 9,000

The following table summarizes the change in fair value, as determined by Level 3 inputs, of the contingent consideration for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
-------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ----- - - ------ - - ------

Additions — — —
Payments — — —
Change in fair value (575 ) (915 ) 1,337
Level 3 liabilities, ending balance $ 9,000 $ 9,575 $ 10,490

The change in fair value of the contingent consideration was primarily due to change in estimates related to development timelines and the passage of time on the fair value measurement of milestones. Adjustments associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration are included in research and development expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success or changes in expected timelines for achievement of any of these milestones could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of the liability. The fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting date is updated by reflecting the changes in fair value reflected in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. There is no assurance that any of the conditions for the milestone payments will be met.

Note 9. Leases

The Company has lease agreements for real estate including corporate offices and warehouse space, vehicles and certain office equipment.

At the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether it contains a lease by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If both criteria are met, the Company calculates the associated lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset upon lease commencement. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the lease term using an appropriate discount rate. Right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made at or before lease commencement and any initial direct costs incurred and exclude any lease incentives received.

The discount rate used is the rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. At the lease commencement date, the discount rate implicit in the lease is used to discount the lease liability, if readily determinable. If not readily determinable or lease do not contain an implicit rate, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used as the discount rate. Discount rates are updated when there is a new lease or a modification to an existing lease, and the methodology is reassessed annually.

The Company records operating lease liabilities within current liabilities or long-term liabilities based upon the length of time associated with the lease payments. The Company records its operating lease right-of-use assets as long-term assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company have elected the practical expedient where lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component for all assets. The Company’s financing leases are not material to our financial statements.

The Company adopted ASC Topic 842 on April 1, 2019 using the optional transition method. As such, the disclosures required under ASC Topic 842 are not presented for periods before the date of adoption. For the comparative period prior to adoption, the Company presents the disclosures which were previously required under ASC Topic 840.

The Company elected the package of transitional practical expedients for leases existing prior to the adoption date. The Company did not reassess whether existing contracts are or contain leases, leases retained their historical lease classification and initial direct costs were not reassessed for capitalization under the new standard. Operating lease assets and liabilities were recognized based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term as of the adoption date.

The following table presents supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases:

Liabilities
Operating lease liabilities in other current liabilities 3,671

Total operating lease liabilities $ 12,220

Expense charged to operations under operating leases was $3.7 million during the year ended March 31, 2020. Short-term lease expenses were not material.

Under ASC Topic 840, Leases (“ASC 840”), the Company recognized rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and recorded the difference between the amount charged to expense and the rent paid as prepaid rent or deferred rent liability. As of March 31, 2019, the amount of deferred rent was $0.3 million, which was subsequently reclassified as contra-asset against the right-of-use asset upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 on April 1, 2019.

The Company grants stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and others. All outstanding stock options of the Company as of March 31, 2020 were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. Outstanding stock options, if not exercised, expire 10 years from the date of grant.

2015 Stock Incentive Plan

The Company’s 2015 Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) authorizes the grant of a variety of equity awards to the Company’s officers, directors, employees, consultants and advisers, including awards of unrestricted and restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock, performance share awards and stock appreciation rights. The 2015 Plan provides that options may only be granted at the current market value on the date of grant. Each share of stock issued pursuant to a stock option or stock appreciation right counts as one share against the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2015 Plan, while each share of stock issued pursuant to any other type of award counts as 1.8 shares against the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2015 Plan. The Company’s policy for issuing shares upon exercise of stock options or the vesting of its restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is to issue shares of common stock at the time of exercise or conversion. At March 31, 2020, a total of approximately 3,609,512 shares were available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan.

Stock-Based Compensation

The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense by financial statement line item in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
----------------------------------- ---------------------------- ------ - ------ - ------
 2020 2019 2018
 (in $000's)
Cost of revenue $ 2,641 $ 2,643 $ 1,721

Selling, general and administrative 31,606 42,539 32,737
 $ 39,781 $ 54,494 $ 40,353

The components of stock-based compensation for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
---------------------------- ---------------------------- ------ - ------ - ------
 2020 2019 2018

Employee stock purchase plan 1,880 1,051 592
 $ 39,781 $ 54,494 $ 40,353

Stock Options

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020:

 Options (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands)
---------------------------------------------------- ---------------------- --- - ------------------------------- - ------ --------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- - ------
Outstanding at beginning of period 853 $ 87.14 5.57
Granted 120 257.88
Exercised (85 ) 44.02
Cancelled and expired (18 ) 224.77
Outstanding at end of period 869 $ 112.03 5.30 $ 60,113
Exercisable at end of period 652 $ 64.38 4.23 $ 59,445
Options vested and expected to vest at end of period 867 $ 112.03 5.29 $ 60,049

Stock options generally vest and become exercisable annually over three years. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for unvested stock option awards at March 31, 2020 was approximately $12.9 million and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.8 years.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $15.0 million, $174.0 million and $66.4 million, respectively. The total cash received as a result of employee stock option exercises during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $3.7 million, $12.9 million and $9.3 million, respectively.

The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option granted at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The weighted average grant-date fair values and weighted average assumptions used in the calculation of fair value of options granted during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
-------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ----- - - ------ - - ----- -
 2020 2019 2018
Valuation assumptions:
Weighted average grant-date fair value $ 93.05 $ 141.47 $ 52.34
Risk-free interest rate 1.97 % 2.91 % 1.87 %
Expected option life (years) 4.14 4.04 4.07
Expected volatility 42.3 % 42.8 % 43.5 %

The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Volatility assumptions are calculated based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company estimates the expected term of options based on historical exercise experience and estimates of future exercises of unexercised options. An expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because the Company does not pay cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures that are expected to occur.

Restricted Stock Units

The following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020:

 Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value
--------------------------------------------- ---------------- ---- - -------------------------------------- - ------
 (in thousands) (per share)
Restricted stock units at beginning of period 620 $ 193.53
Granted 161 258.59
Vested (393 ) 144.62
Forfeited (68 ) 304.90
Restricted stock units at end of period 320 $ 263.92

Restricted stock units generally vest annually over three years. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense for outstanding restricted stock units, including performance-based awards, as of March 31, 2020 was $23.8 million and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.5 years.

The weighted average grant-date fair value for restricted stock units granted during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $258.59, $376.95 and $137.40 per share, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $99.3 million, $171.3 million and $51.0 million, respectively.

Performance Awards

Restricted stock units include certain awards that vest subject to certain performance. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense for outstanding performance restricted stock units as of March 31, 2020 was $4.5 million and the weighted-average period over which this cost will be recognized is 1.1 years.

In May 2019, performance-based awards of restricted stock units for the potential issuance of up to 196,580 shares of common stock were issued to certain executive officers and employees, which vest upon achievement of prescribed service milestones by the award recipients and the achievement of prescribed performance milestones by the Company. The Company did not meet the prescribed performance milestones in fiscal 2020 and therefore no shares will vest for these performance-based awards and the Company reversed all previously recorded stock stock-based compensation expense related to this award in the three months ended March 31, 2020.

In May 2018, performance-based awards of restricted stock units for the potential issuance of 114,000 shares of common stock were issued to certain executive officers and employees, which vest upon achievement of prescribed service milestones by the award recipients and performance milestones by the Company.  The Company met the prescribed performance milestones in fiscal 2019 such that the remaining outstanding 47,000 shares of common stock as of March 31, 2020 will vest subject to service requirements for vesting for these employees and stock-based compensation expense is being recognized accordingly over the employee’s service term.

In May 2017, performance-based awards of restricted stock units for the potential issuance of 159,000 shares of common stock were issued to certain executive officers and employees, which vest upon achievement of prescribed service milestones by the award recipients and performance milestones by the Company.  The Company met the prescribed performance milestones in fiscal 2018 such that the remaining outstanding 43,000 shares of common stock as of March 31, 2020 will vest subject to service requirements for vesting for these employees and stock-based compensation expense is being recognized accordingly over the employee’s service term.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP. Under the ESPP, eligible employees, including officers and directors, who have completed at least three months of employment with the Company or its subsidiaries who elect to participate in the purchase plan instruct the Company to withhold a specified amount of the employee’s income each payroll period during a six-month payment period (the periods April 1—September 30 and October 1—March 31). On the last business day of each six-month payment period, the amount withheld is used to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price equal to 85% of the lower of its market price on the first business day or the last business day of the payment period.
 P10Y
 Each share of stock issued pursuant to a stock option or stock appreciation right counts as one share against the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2015 Plan, while each share of stock issued pursuant to any other type of award counts as 1.8 shares against the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2015 Plan.

Note 12. Income Taxes

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”), was signed into law. The Tax Reform Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that were effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Act included significant changes in tax laws, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings on foreign subsidiaries, if applicable; (3) adding a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”); and (4) imposing additional limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation and certain employee fringe benefits. ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” requires that the effects of changes in tax laws or rates be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. Those effects, both current and deferred, are reported as part of the tax provision, regardless of income in which the underlying pretax income (expense) or asset (liability) was or will be reported.

As a result of the Tax Reform Act, the Company’s U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21% was applied in the computation of the income tax provision for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 and a blended U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 31.5% was applied in the computation of the income tax provision for the year ended March 31, 2018. The blended U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 31.5% represents the average rate between the pre-enactment U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 35% prior to the January 1, 2018 effective date and the post-enactment U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21% thereafter. As a result of the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate, the Company evaluated its ability to utilize its foreign tax credits carryforward. The Company has concluded that it will be able to use these foreign tax credits within the carryforward period.

The Company remeasured its net deferred tax assets due to the lower U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate and recorded an income tax expense adjustment of $21.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2018. The Tax Reform Act allows for a 100% deduction for the potential repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings with minimal U.S. income tax consequences other than the one-time transition tax. Since most of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are disregarded entities for domestic tax purposes, any repatriation of such funds to the U.S. would likely have a nominal tax impact. In addition, the Company has elected to treat GILTI tax as a period expense and provide for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. The federal income tax expenses associated with GILTI was $0 and $0.5 million in the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Company’s income tax provision was $53.8 million, $4.3 million and $48.3 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate was 21.0%, 1.6% and 30.1% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits and shortfalls to be recognized in the income tax provision as discrete items in the period when restricted stock units vest or stock option exercises occur, whereas previously such income tax effects were recorded as part of additional paid-in capital only when the related tax deduction resulted in a reduction of current income taxes payable. The Company recognized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards of $14.8 million, $69.3 million and $31.0 million as an income tax benefit for fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount of future excess tax benefits or shortfalls will likely fluctuate from period to period based on the price of the Company’s stock, the number of restricted stock units that vest or stock options that are exercised, and the fair value assigned to such stock-based awards under U.S. GAAP.

The components of the Company’s income tax provision for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,

The significant differences between the statutory and effective income tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 consist of the following items:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- ----- - ---- ----- ---- - ----- - -

Rate differential on foreign operations 3.2 0.2 —
Other (0.6 ) 0.4 0.6
Effective tax rate 21.0 % 1.6 % 30.1 %

The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. In determining whether its deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable, the Company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence, and weights the evidence based on its objectivity.

As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $15.2 million and $1.3 million for deferred tax assets primarily related to foreign tax credits that are expected not to be utilizable in the foreign branch basket. Based on the review of all available evidence, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce these deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realizable as of March 31, 2020 and 2019.

Changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

 Fiscal Years Ended March 31,
---------------------------- ---------------------------- ------ ---- - ----- ---- - ------ -
 2020 2019 2018
 (in $000's)
Balance at beginning of year $ 1,302 $ 1,652 $ 2,468
Increase 13,868 — 325
Decrease — (350 ) (1,141 )
Balance at end of year $ 15,170 $ 1,302 $ 1,652

As of March 31, 2020, the Company had foreign net-operating losses (“NOLs”) of approximately $24.1 million. As of March 31, 2020, the Company had foreign tax credits of $21.5 million which expire in varying years from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2030. In addition, at March 31, 2020, the Company had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $20.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively, which expire in varying years from fiscal 2021 through fiscal 2040.

The Company’s operating income outside the U.S. is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. The Tax Reform Act allows for a 100% deduction for the repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings with minimal U.S. income tax consequences other than a one-time deemed repatriation toll charge. Since most of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held by foreign subsidiaries which are disregarded entities for domestic tax purposes, any repatriation of such funds to the U.S. would likely have a nominal tax impact, if any.

As of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has no material uncertain tax positions, and no interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions were recognized during the years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. During fiscal 2019, the Company closed an income tax audit in Germany, which covered fiscal years 2012 through 2015. The Company also closed an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit during fiscal 2019 relating to its fiscal year 2016 tax return.  These audits did not materially impact the Company’s financial statements. All other tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS, state and foreign tax authorities.

['s cash flows are impacted by their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, short and long-term marketable securities and accounts receivable. Management mitigates credit risk by limiting the investment type and maturity to securities that preserve capital, maintain liquidity and have a high credit quality.

Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and contingent consideration. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered reasonable estimates of their fair value, due to the short maturity of these investments.

Derivative Instruments

The Company uses a foreign-exchange-related derivative instrument to manage its exposure related to changes in the exchange rate on its intercompany loan. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap designated as a hedging instrument that effectively offsets the variability of cash flows are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. These amounts subsequently are reclassified into the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the related hedged item affects earnings. For more information, see “Note 4. Financial Instruments—Derivative Instruments.”

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is based on the first in, first out method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and writes down to its net realizable value any inventory that it believes to be impaired. Management considers forecast demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is not written back up if demand increases.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is carried at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of three to five years for machinery and equipment, computer software, and furniture and fixtures. Building and building improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of seven to thirty-three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses.

Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved and other valuation techniques.

Other Investments

The Company periodically makes investments in medical device companies that focus on heart failure and heart pumps and other medical device technologies. For investments in convertible debt or preferred stock securities that do not have readily determinable market values, the Company measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment. The Company monitors any events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant effect on the fair value of investments, either due to impairment or based on observable price changes, and makes any necessary adjustments.

Leases

On April 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” This new guidance required that the Company’s lease commitments to be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, which increased total assets and total liabilities that the Company reported on its consolidated balance sheet. For a discussion on the impact of this accounting policy adoption, including key accounting policies and elections, see “Note 9. Leases.”

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded when consideration for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually at October 31, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company’s products and services, regulatory and political developments, cost factors, and entity specific factors such as strategies and overall financial performance. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing a two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step is a comparison of the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. If the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further procedures are required. However, if the reporting unit’s fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment of goodwill may exist, requiring a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit.

The Company performed a qualitative assessment during its annual impairment review for fiscal 2020 as of October 31, 2019 and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit is not less than its carrying amount. Therefore, the two-step goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit was not necessary in fiscal 2020.

In-Process Research and Development

In-process research and development, or IPR&D, assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. IPR&D assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies that are acquired, which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. During the period that the IPR&D assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 31, or more frequently if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the IPR&D assets are less than their carrying values. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs upon regulatory approval and the Company is able to commercialize products associated with the IPR&D assets, these assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If development is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have a full or partial impairment charge related to the IPR&D assets, calculated as the excess of carrying value of the IPR&D assets over fair value. The Company performed its annual impairment review for fiscal 2020 as of October 31, 2019 and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D assets is not less than its carrying value.

Contingent Consideration

Contingent consideration represents potential milestones that the Company could pay additional consideration for a business acquisition and is recorded as a liability and is measured at fair value using a combination of (1) an income approach, based on various revenue and cost assumptions and applying a probability to each outcome and (2) a Monte-Carlo valuation model that simulates outcomes based on management estimates. With the income approach, probabilities were applied to each potential scenario and the resulting values were discounted using a rate that considers the weighted average cost of capital, the related projections, and the overall business. The Monte-Carlo valuation model simulates estimated future revenues during the earn out-period using management']:
Note 19 -- Commitments and Contingencies 126

['s business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as the response to the pandemic is developing and information is rapidly evolving. In recent months, a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has spread to many countries around the world and the outbreak has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services has also declared a public health emergency in the U.S. in response to the outbreak. Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the COVID-19 virus and its potential effects, and the extent of and effectiveness of responses taken on international, national and local levels. Measures taken to limit the impact of COVID-19, including shelter-in-place orders, social distancing measures, travel bans and restrictions, and business and government shutdowns, have already created significant negative economic impacts on a global basis.

Due to these impacts and measures, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for its products as healthcare customers divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, the Company’s customers may delay, cancel, or redirect planned purchases in order to focus resources on COVID-19 or in response to economic disruption related to COVID-19. For example, beginning in mid-March 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company experienced a significant decline in patient utilization in the U.S. and Europe, as healthcare systems diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19. In addition, public health bodies have recommended delaying elective medical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may continue to negatively impact the usage of the Company’s products, including the number of Impella heart pump procedures. The Company may also experience delays in clinical trial enrollment or encounter interruption or delays in the operations of FDA or other regulatory authorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact review and approval timelines. At the end of March 2020, the Company temporarily paused new enrollments in its active clinical trials in response to the COVID-19 response around the globe. The severity of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic and the extent and severity of the impact on its customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.

While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, the Company expects that its revenues, operating results and operating cash flows for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 will be materially adversely impacted. The Company currently expects to see sequential quarterly improvement in the remainder of fiscal 2021 as elective medical procedures are expected to be rescheduled. Further cancellations or delays could materially adversely impact the Company’s revenues and financial results. The Company cannot predict when elective medical procedures will resume or when symptomatic patients will return to the hospital or if its access to hospital sites will be limited, but the Company believes that the implementation of the cost reduction efforts that it has imposed, as discussed in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

– COVID-19 Pandemic,” will help mitigate the impact that reduced revenues may have on its fiscal 2021 operating results. The Company intends to continue to monitor the situation and may extend these actions if necessary.

As of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact the Company']:
Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 13

['s best estimates. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success or changes in expected timelines for achievement of any of these milestones could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of the contingent consideration liability. The fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting date is updated by reflecting the changes in fair value reflected within research and development expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

Accrued Expenses

As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Company is required to estimate accrued expenses. This process includes identifying services that third parties have performed and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred on these services as of each balance sheet date in its financial statements. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include estimates for certain payroll costs, such as bonuses and commissions; contract service fees, such as amounts due to clinical research organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials; professional service fees, such as attorneys and accountants, and third-party expenses relating to marketing efforts associated with commercialization of the Company’s products. The dates in which certain services commence and end, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of services is often subject to the Company’s judgment. The Company makes these judgments and estimates based upon known facts and circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

On April 1, 2018 the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 (“Topic 606”), “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.’ For a discussion on the impact of this accounting policy adoption, including key accounting policies and elections, see “Note 3. Revenue Recognition.”

Product Warranty

The Company generally provides a one-year warranty for certain products sold in which estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded as an expense at the time of shipment. The Company’s products are subject to regulatory and quality standards. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical product performance rates and related costs to repair given products. The accounting estimate related to product warranty expense involves judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs. Should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income, plus all changes in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including any foreign currency translation adjustments. These changes in equity are recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consist of foreign currency translation adjustments and changes in unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities and any unrealized gains or losses from derivative instruments.  There were no reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

The functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. The assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The cumulative translation effect for subsidiaries using a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar is included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company’s intercompany accounts are denominated in the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany transactions that the Company considers to be of a long-term investment nature are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, while gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of intercompany transactions from those foreign subsidiaries for which the Company anticipates settlement in the foreseeable future are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. The net foreign currency translation gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not significant.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted net income per share is computed using the treasury stock method by dividing net income by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted shares outstanding is calculated by adding to the weighted average shares outstanding any potential dilutive securities outstanding for the fiscal year. Potential dilutive securities include stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based stock awards and shares to be purchased under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s basic and diluted net income per share were as follows (figures in tables are in thousands, except per share data):

For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 232,000, 64,000 and 155,000 shares of common stock underlying outstanding securities related to out-of-the-money stock options and performance-based awards where milestones were not met were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period.

The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of the valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company estimates the expected term of options based on historical exercise experience and estimates of future exercises of unexercised options. In addition, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because the Company does not pay cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur instead of estimating forfeitures that are expected to occur. An accounting policy change was made by the Company related to the recording of forfeitures in fiscal 2018 as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (“Topic 718”): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” discussed further below.

For awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with service and performance-based conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period. Estimates of stock-based compensation expense for an award with performance conditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. The cumulative effect of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and deferred provision. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on income tax returns for the current fiscal year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future income tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years as the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to impact taxable income.

The Company regularly assesses its ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Assessing the realization of deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit at the largest amount that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on an ongoing basis, when applicable. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, new information and technical insights, and changes in tax laws. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. Refer to “Note 12. Income Taxes” for further information related to the Tax Reform Act and its impact on the Company’s financial statements.  When applicable, the Company accrues for the effects of uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest through income tax expense.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Effective April 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) standard update ASU 2016-02 “Leases,” which requires lessees to identify arrangements that should be accounted for as leases. Under this guidance, for lease arrangements exceeding a one-year term, a right-of-use asset and lease obligation is recorded by the lessee for all leases on the balance sheet, whether operating or financing, while the statement of operations includes lease expense for operating leases and amortization and interest expense for financing leases. ASU 2016-02 was adopted using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at or entered into after the April 1, 2019. Additional information and disclosures required by this new standard are contained in “Note 9. Leases.”

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326).” This guidance will require financial instruments to be measured at amortized cost, and accounts receivables to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The new model requires an entity to estimate credit losses based on historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2016-13 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).” This guidance simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which required companies to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill and recognize an impairment charge by the amount in which the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value. Under the new guidance, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded, even if the difference is attributable to the fair value of other assets in the reporting unit. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2017-04 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820).” which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The Company has investments accounted for and disclosed under Topic 820 and will modify disclosures as applicable to conform with the new guidance. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard and the required disclosure changes to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-13 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2021.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740).”   This amendment to the guidance on income taxes is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The amendment eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The amendment also clarifies existing guidance related to the evaluation of a step up in the tax basis of goodwill, and the effects of enacted changes in tax laws or rates in the effective tax rate computation, among other clarifications. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2019-12 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2022.

In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, “Investments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815),” an amendment clarifying the interaction between accounting standards related to equity securities, equity method investments, and certain derivative instruments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. ASU 2020-01 will become effective for the Company in fiscal 2022.

Note 3. Revenue Recognition

Adoption of Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”

The Company adopted Topic 606 on April 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method for all revenue contracts not completed as of the date of adoption. The reported results for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 reflect the application of Topic 606 guidance while the reported results for fiscal year 2018 were prepared under the guidance of ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition.” The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the timing or amount of revenue recognized upon adoption and there was no cumulative prior period adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption. Accordingly, the adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, statement of operations, stockholders’ equity or cash flows.

The Company has made the following accounting policy elections and elected to use certain practical expedients, as permitted by the FASB, in applying Topic 606: (1) the Company accounts for amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes, net of related amounts remitted to tax authorities; (2) the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component because, at contract inception, the Company expects the period between the time when the Company transfers a promised good or service to the customer and the time when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less; (3) the Company expenses costs to obtain a contract as they are incurred if the expected period of benefit, and therefore the amortization period, is one year or less; (4) the Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after control transfers to the customer as a fulfillment cost rather than an additional promised service and these fulfillment costs are recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses; (5) the Company does not assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer; and (6) the Company does not disclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the original expected contract duration is one year or less.

The Company generates product revenue from the sale of Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0, Impella LD, Impella 5.5, Impella RP and Impella AIC products and related accessories. The Company also earns revenue from preventative maintenance service contracts and maintenance calls.

The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:

 • Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer

 • Identification of the performance obligation in the contract

 • Determination of the transaction price

 • Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract

 • Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied

Identification of contracts and performance obligations

The Company accounts for a contract with a customer when there is an approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. The Company']:

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration.

Note 9. Leases

The Company has lease agreements for real estate including corporate offices and warehouse space, vehicles and certain office equipment.

At the inception of a contractual arrangement, the Company determines whether it contains a lease by assessing whether there is an identified asset and whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset in exchange for consideration over a period of time. If both criteria are met, the Company calculates the associated lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset upon lease commencement. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the lease term using an appropriate discount rate. Right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made at or before lease commencement and any initial direct costs incurred and exclude any lease incentives received.

The discount rate used is the rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. At the lease commencement date, the discount rate implicit in the lease is used to discount the lease liability, if readily determinable. If not readily determinable or lease do not contain an implicit rate, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used as the discount rate. Discount rates are updated when there is a new lease or a modification to an existing lease, and the methodology is reassessed annually.

The Company records operating lease liabilities within current liabilities or long-term liabilities based upon the length of time associated with the lease payments. The Company records its operating lease right-of-use assets as long-term assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company have elected the practical expedient where lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component for all assets. The Company’s financing leases are not material to our financial statements.

The Company adopted ASC Topic 842 on April 1, 2019 using the optional transition method. As such, the disclosures required under ASC Topic 842 are not presented for periods before the date of adoption. For the comparative period prior to adoption, the Company presents the disclosures which were previously required under ASC Topic 840.

The Company elected the package of transitional practical expedients for leases existing prior to the adoption date. The Company did not reassess whether existing contracts are or contain leases, leases retained their historical lease classification and initial direct costs were not reassessed for capitalization under the new standard. Operating lease assets and liabilities were recognized based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term as of the adoption date.

The following table presents supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases:

Note 24. New Accounting Standards: Recently adopted On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Additionally, ASU 2016-02 modifies current guidance for lessors' accounting. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. PMI has identified its lease management system and has identified and evaluated the applicable leases. In addition to the guidance in ASU 2016-02, PMI has evaluated ASU 2018-11, which was issued in July 2018 and provides an optional transitional method. As a result of this evaluation, PMI elected to use the optional transition method, which allows companies to use the effective date as the date of initial application on transition and not adjust comparative period financial information or make the new required disclosures for periods prior to the effective date. Additionally, PMI elected to use the hindsight practical expedient, as well as the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard. Upon adoption, PMI recognized lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its operating leases in place at that time. At January 1, 2019, PMI's adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in an increase of approximately $0.7 billion on its assets and liabilities in its statement of financial position. ASU 2016-02 did not have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. For further details, see Note 23. Leases.

Note 11. Stock Award Plans and Stock-Based Compensation

Stock Award Plans

The Company grants stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and others. All outstanding stock options of the Company as of March 31, 2020 were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. Outstanding stock options, if not exercised, expire 10 years from the date of grant.

2015 Stock Incentive Plan

The Company’s 2015 Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) authorizes the grant of a variety of equity awards to the Company’s officers, directors, employees, consultants and advisers, including awards of unrestricted and restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive and nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of common stock, performance share awards and stock appreciation rights. The 2015 Plan provides that options may only be granted at the current market value on the date of grant. Each share of stock issued pursuant to a stock option or stock appreciation right counts as one share against the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2015 Plan, while each share of stock issued pursuant to any other type of award counts as 1.8 shares against the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2015 Plan. The Company’s policy for issuing shares upon exercise of stock options or the vesting of its restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is to issue shares of common stock at the time of exercise or conversion. At March 31, 2020, a total of approximately 3,609,512 shares were available for future issuance under the 2015 Plan.

Note 12. Income Taxes

In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”), was signed into law. The Tax Reform Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that were effective January 1, 2018. The Tax Reform Act included significant changes in tax laws, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings on foreign subsidiaries, if applicable; (3) adding a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”); and (4) imposing additional limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation and certain employee fringe benefits. ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” requires that the effects of changes in tax laws or rates be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. Those effects, both current and deferred, are reported as part of the tax provision, regardless of income in which the underlying pretax income (expense) or asset (liability) was or will be reported.

As a result of the Tax Reform Act, the Company’s U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21% was applied in the computation of the income tax provision for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 and a blended U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 31.5% was applied in the computation of the income tax provision for the year ended March 31, 2018. The blended U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 31.5% represents the average rate between the pre-enactment U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 35% prior to the January 1, 2018 effective date and the post-enactment U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate of 21% thereafter. As a result of the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate, the Company evaluated its ability to utilize its foreign tax credits carryforward. The Company has concluded that it will be able to use these foreign tax credits within the carryforward period.

The Company remeasured its net deferred tax assets due to the lower U.S. federal statutory corporate tax rate and recorded an income tax expense adjustment of $21.4 million during the year ended March 31, 2018. The Tax Reform Act allows for a 100% deduction for the potential repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings with minimal U.S. income tax consequences other than the one-time transition tax. Since most of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are disregarded entities for domestic tax purposes, any repatriation of such funds to the U.S. would likely have a nominal tax impact. In addition, the Company has elected to treat GILTI tax as a period expense and provide for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. The federal income tax expenses associated with GILTI was $0 and $0.5 million in the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Company’s income tax provision was $53.8 million, $4.3 million and $48.3 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company’s effective tax rate was 21.0%, 1.6% and 30.1% for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

ASU 2016-09 requires excess tax benefits and shortfalls to be recognized in the income tax provision as discrete items in the period when restricted stock units vest or stock option exercises occur, whereas previously such income tax effects were recorded as part of additional paid-in capital only when the related tax deduction resulted in a reduction of current income taxes payable. The Company recognized excess tax benefits associated with stock-based awards of $14.8 million, $69.3 million and $31.0 million as an income tax benefit for fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount of future excess tax benefits or shortfalls will likely fluctuate from period to period based on the price of the Company’s stock, the number of restricted stock units that vest or stock options that are exercised, and the fair value assigned to such stock-based awards under U.S. GAAP.

The components of the Company’s income tax provision for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

NOTE 28: SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On February 4, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we will sell Security & Detection Systems and MacDonald Humfrey Automation solutions ("airport security and automation business") to Leidos, Inc. for $1 billion in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments as set forth in the definitive agreement. The sale transaction is conditioned on customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. We expect the sale transaction to close in mid-2020; however, there can be no assurances that the conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable) or that closing will occur in mid-2020 or at all. We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the airport security and automation business to repurchase shares of our common stock. The airport security and automation business provides solutions used by the aviation and transportation industries, regulatory and customs authorities, government and law enforcement agencies and commercial and other high-security facilities. The decision to divest the airport security and automation business represented a significant milestone in our strategic priority to reshape our portfolio and focus our resources on core technologies following the L3Harris Merger. The airport security and automation business had approximately $500 million in annual revenue. Because the expected disposal did not meet the held for sale criteria as of January 3, 2020, the assets and liabilities of the airport security and automation business were not classified as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 3, 2020. We do not expect the divestiture of the airport security and automation business will have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 126 SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED) Selected quarterly financial data is summarized below: ----------------------------------------------------- ...

['s cash flows are impacted by their response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, short and long-term marketable securities and accounts receivable. Management mitigates credit risk by limiting the investment type and maturity to securities that preserve capital, maintain liquidity and have a high credit quality.

Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and contingent consideration. The carrying amounts of accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered reasonable estimates of their fair value, due to the short maturity of these investments.

Derivative Instruments

The Company uses a foreign-exchange-related derivative instrument to manage its exposure related to changes in the exchange rate on its intercompany loan. The Company does not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of the cross-currency swap designated as a hedging instrument that effectively offsets the variability of cash flows are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. These amounts subsequently are reclassified into the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the related hedged item affects earnings. For more information, see “Note 4. Financial Instruments—Derivative Instruments.”

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is based on the first in, first out method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and writes down to its net realizable value any inventory that it believes to be impaired. Management considers forecast demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is not written back up if demand increases.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Land is carried at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of three to five years for machinery and equipment, computer software, and furniture and fixtures. Building and building improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of seven to thirty-three years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses.

Property and equipment is reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved and other valuation techniques.

Other Investments

The Company periodically makes investments in medical device companies that focus on heart failure and heart pumps and other medical device technologies. For investments in convertible debt or preferred stock securities that do not have readily determinable market values, the Company measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment. The Company monitors any events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant effect on the fair value of investments, either due to impairment or based on observable price changes, and makes any necessary adjustments.

Leases

On April 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases.” This new guidance required that the Company’s lease commitments to be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, which increased total assets and total liabilities that the Company reported on its consolidated balance sheet. For a discussion on the impact of this accounting policy adoption, including key accounting policies and elections, see “Note 9. Leases.”

Goodwill

Goodwill is recorded when consideration for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually at October 31, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

In applying the goodwill impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry conditions, the competitive environment, changes in the market for the Company’s products and services, regulatory and political developments, cost factors, and entity specific factors such as strategies and overall financial performance. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then performing a two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step is a comparison of the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. If the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further procedures are required. However, if the reporting unit’s fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment of goodwill may exist, requiring a second step to measure the amount of impairment loss. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit.

The Company performed a qualitative assessment during its annual impairment review for fiscal 2020 as of October 31, 2019 and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company’s single reporting unit is not less than its carrying amount. Therefore, the two-step goodwill impairment test for the reporting unit was not necessary in fiscal 2020.

In-Process Research and Development

In-process research and development, or IPR&D, assets are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development projects. IPR&D assets represent the fair value assigned to technologies that are acquired, which at the time of acquisition have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. During the period that the IPR&D assets are considered indefinite-lived, they are tested for impairment on an annual basis on October 31, or more frequently if the Company becomes aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the IPR&D assets are less than their carrying values. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs upon regulatory approval and the Company is able to commercialize products associated with the IPR&D assets, these assets are then deemed definite-lived and are amortized based on their estimated useful lives at that point in time. If development is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have a full or partial impairment charge related to the IPR&D assets, calculated as the excess of carrying value of the IPR&D assets over fair value. The Company performed its annual impairment review for fiscal 2020 as of October 31, 2019 and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the IPR&D assets is not less than its carrying value.

Contingent Consideration

Contingent consideration represents potential milestones that the Company could pay additional consideration for a business acquisition and is recorded as a liability and is measured at fair value using a combination of (1) an income approach, based on various revenue and cost assumptions and applying a probability to each outcome and (2) a Monte-Carlo valuation model that simulates outcomes based on management estimates. With the income approach, probabilities were applied to each potential scenario and the resulting values were discounted using a rate that considers the weighted average cost of capital, the related projections, and the overall business. The Monte-Carlo valuation model simulates estimated future revenues during the earn out-period using management']:
