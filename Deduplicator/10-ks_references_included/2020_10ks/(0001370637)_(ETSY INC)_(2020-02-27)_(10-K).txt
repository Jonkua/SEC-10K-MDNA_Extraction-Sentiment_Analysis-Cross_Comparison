Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion, particularly information with respect to our outlook, our plans and strategy for our business and our performance and future success, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in the “Risk Factors” section. For more information regarding key factors affecting our performance, see “Key Factors Affecting Our Performance” below.

Overview
Business

Etsy operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers. Our mission is to “Keep Commerce Human,” and we’re committed to using the power of business and technology to strengthen communities and empower people around the world.
Our primary marketplace, Etsy.com, is the global destination for unique and creative goods. The Etsy marketplaceconnects creative entrepreneurs with thoughtful consumers looking for items that are intended to be special, reflect their sense of style, or represent a meaningful occasion.Our sellers are the heart and soul of Etsy, and our technology platform allows our sellers to turn their creative passions into economic opportunity. We have a seller-aligned business model: we make money when our sellers make money. We offer Etsy sellers a marketplace with millions of buyers along with a range of seller tools and services that are specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses.
We are focused on attracting potential buyers to the Etsy marketplace for those “special” purchaseoccasions that happen throughout the year, and for everyday items that have meaning. We are deepening engagement with our existing buyers by inspiring purchases across our many retail categories and special occasions. Special purchases for use in the every day include handmade or vintage unique clothing, accessories, household items, or furniture that the buyer wants to reflect her sense of style. Special purchase occasions can occur many times throughout the year and include shopping for special occasions that reflects an individual’s unique style; gifting that demonstrates thought and care; and celebrations that express creativity and fun. Buyers tell us that they come to Etsy because Etsy sellers offer items that they can’t find anywhere else.
On August 15, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Reverb Holdings, Inc. (“Reverb”) for $270.4 million, net of cash acquired. The Reverb marketplace is a leading global online marketplace dedicated to buying and selling new, used, and vintage musical instruments, with a vibrant community of buyers and sellers all over the world. Reverb, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Etsy, Inc., is included in all financial and other metrics from August 15, 2019 (the date of acquisition), unless otherwise noted.
Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services we provide to sellers to help them generate more sales and scale their businesses.

Marketplace revenue is comprised of the fees a seller pays us for marketplace activities. Marketplace activities include listing an item for sale, completing transactions between a buyer and a seller, and using our payments services to process payments, including foreign currency transactions. Marketplace revenue also includes revenue generated through our commercial partnerships, which was recorded in its own Other revenue line prior to the fourth quarter of 2019.

Services revenue is comprised of the fees a seller pays us for our optional other services (“Services”). Services primarily include advertising services, which allows sellers to pay for prominent placement of their listings in search results; and shipping labels, which allows sellers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia to purchase discounted shipping labels.
Our strategy is focused on growing the Etsy marketplace in our six core geographies and building a sustainable competitive advantage around four elements of our business that we believe differentiate us from our competitors, or what we call our “Right to Win.” The foundation of Etsy’s competitive advantage is our collection of our seller’s unique items, which, we believe, when combined with best-in-class search and discovery, human connections, and a trusted brand, will enable us to continue to stand out among other e-commerce platforms and marketplaces. Our investments in product, marketing, and talent will be focused on capitalizing on these four elements of our business. Ultimately, the goal of our long-term strategy is to drive

more new buyers to the website, give existing buyers reasons to come back more often, encourage buyers to spend more per order, and fuel success for our sellers. We see a number of similarities between the levers of growth for the Etsy and Reverb marketplaces, including improving search and discovery, making selling and buying easier, and building a global brand and user community.
Year Highlights
Total revenue was $818.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by growth in both Marketplace and Services revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded net income of $95.9 million, and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $186.3 million. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
As of December 31, 2019, our marketplaces connected 2.7 million active sellers and 46.4 million active buyers, in nearly every country in the world. In the year ended December 31, 2019, sellers generated GMS of $5.0 billion of which approximately 58% came from purchases made on mobile devices. We are a global company and approximately 36% of our GMS in the year ended December 31, 2019 came from transactions where either a seller or a buyer was located outside of the United States.
Other Operational Highlights

In 2019 we focused on growing the Etsy marketplace in our six core geographies, and owning special purchase occasions – style, gifting, and celebrations – throughout the year. Below are key operational highlights:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We continued to launch new product enhancements and build upon prior launches to help Etsy buyers find the right product at the right time, or discover inspiration among the items in the Etsy marketplace. Product experiment velocity reached a record high during the year. We made a foundational upgrade to our ranking algorithms, which will continue to enable us to provide more relevant search results to Etsy buyers. In addition, we continued to improve our mobile app, highlighting items that are similar to items Etsy buyers have made a favorite in the past, launched variation photos, and integrated several shipping solutions, all geared to helping improve their shopping experience. We focused on our collection of unique items by enhancing the image quality for listings on desktop, our largest channel by device, which is intended to convert more visits into purchases.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We continued to focus on utilizing our marketing efforts to drive new and existing buyers to Etsy. We launched a new national television campaign, which had a positive impact on visits and purchase intent. We also launched our 2019 holiday television campaign in the second half of the year, which continued to positively move brand metrics on purchase intent and brand awareness. We kicked off our first international television campaign towards the end of 2019.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We continued to enhance, expand, and introduce new product offerings and seller tools. In July, we began providing Etsy sellers with tools and support to make it easy for them to guarantee free shipping on orders of $35 or more to U.S. buyers. We also launched a regional sales feature, which allows for Etsy sellers to set a country-specific sale, with a focus on their domestic listings. As of the end of the year, 65% of U.S. buyer GMS shipped for free, 74% of U.S. listing views were eligible to ship for free, and 48% of orders were delivered with free shipping.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We made progress simplifying our marketing tools for Etsy sellers to enable them to more easily invest in their growth. In the third quarter of 2019, we streamlined Promoted Listings, Etsy’s onsite ads platform, and Google Shopping, an off-site marketing tool for Etsy.com sellers, into one unified ad platform, called Etsy Ads. Etsy Ads enables Etsy sellers to set a budget and Etsy then allocates that budget between channels, targeting optimal return on seller spend. With the initial launch of Etsy Ads, our Promoted Listings service was no longer offered as a standalone advertising option during the fourth quarter of 2019.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We progressed on our impact goals, including our ecological goal to build long-term resilience by eliminating our carbon impacts and fostering responsible resource use. In February 2019, we began offsetting 100% of carbon emissions generated by shipping on Etsy.com, which represent 97% of our total measured emissions.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We have also focused on growth investments, such as our migration to Google Cloud. In 2019, we achieved significant milestones in the process by beginning to serve our search traffic from Google Cloud and migrating a majority of our systems to Google Cloud, including our machine learning efforts. As a result of migrating our Etsy.com search efforts to Google Cloud, we were able to make the foundational upgrade to our ranking algorithms for the Etsy marketplace. We spent approximately $30 million on cloud migration costs in 2019, which includes

implementation costs and costs related to cloud usage for growth initiatives, and completed the migration in February 2020.
While our Etsy Ads platform delivered positive returns for many Etsy sellers and revenue growth for Etsy in the fourth quarter of 2019, we will be iterating on our advertising offerings to help sellers more effectively drive traffic to their listings. In the second quarter of 2020, Etsy is planning to launch a new advertising service for Etsy sellers, called Offsite Ads. Etsy will pay the upfront costs to promote Etsy sellers’ listings on multiple internet platforms without any upfront costs for sellers. When a shopper clicks on an online offsite ad featuring a seller’s listing and purchases from their shop, the seller will pay Etsy an advertising fee on that order - only when they make a sale. The Etsy Ads service will be a dedicated on-site advertising program for sellers to promote their listings to shoppers on Etsy.
Debt
In September 2019, we issued $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the Securities Act. The initial conversion price of the 2019 Notes represented a premium of approximately 47.5% over the price of our common stock. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Notes were $639.5 million after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and offering expenses. The 2019 Notes will mature on October 1, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.
We used $76.2 million of the net proceeds from the 2019 Notes offering to enter into separate capped call transactions (“2019 Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The 2019 Capped Call Transactions effectively increase the premium for conversion of the 2019 Notes at maturity to 100% and are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the 2019 Notes and offset any payments we make upon conversion.
In addition, we used $124.5 million of the net proceeds from the 2019 Notes to repurchase 2,094,196 shares of our common stock. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the 2019 Notes offering for general corporate purposes.
On February 25, 2019, we entered into a $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement with several lenders (the “2019 Credit Agreement”). The 2019 Credit Agreement will mature in February 2024. The 2019 Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of $30.0 million and a swingline loan sublimit of $10.0 million.
For more information on the 2019 Notes, 2019 Capped Call Transactions, and 2019 Credit Agreement, see “Note 13—Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reclassification of Revenue Categories
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we reclassified Other revenue to Marketplace revenue. The following table provides our Marketplace revenue and Other revenue under our previous and current presentation for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

(4) Active sellers and active buyers includes Reverb’s active sellers and active buyers of 162 thousand and 624 thousand, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. Reverb active sellers and active buyers are sellers and buyers who have incurred at least one charge or made at least one purchase, respectively, from Reverb in the last 12 months. Etsy.comactive sellers and active buyers were approximately 2.5 million and 45.7 million, respectively.

GMS
Gross merchandise sales (“GMS”) is the dollar value of items sold in our marketplaces within the applicable period, excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with canceled transactions. GMS does not represent revenue earned by us. GMS is largely driven by transactions in our marketplaces and is not directly impacted by Services activity. However, because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace, we believe that GMS is an indicator of the success of our sellers, the satisfaction of our buyers, and the health, scale, and growth of our business. We track “Paid GMS” for the Etsy marketplace, and define it as Etsy.com GMS that is attributable to our performance marketing efforts, which excludes most of our marketing investments focused on brand awareness like TV and digital video.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA represents our net income (loss) adjusted to exclude: interest and other non-operating expense, net; (benefit) provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign exchange (gain) loss; acquisition-related expenses; non-ordinary course disputes; restructuring and other exit costs (income); asset impairment charges; net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities; and contributions to Good Work Institute (formerly Etsy.org). See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information regarding our use of Adjusted EBITDA, including its limitations as a financial measure, and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Active Sellers
An active seller is a seller who has incurred at least one charge from us in the last 12 months. Charges include Marketplace and Services Revenue fees discussed in “Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —Revenue Recognition” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A seller is separately identified in each of our marketplaces by a unique e-mail address; a single person can have multiple seller accounts and can count as a distinct active seller in each of our marketplaces. We succeed when sellers succeed, so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of the awareness of our brand, the reach of our platform, the potential for growth in GMS and revenue, and the health of our business.
Active Buyers
An active buyer is a buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months. A buyer is separately identified in each of our marketplaces by a unique e-mail address; a single person can have multiple buyer accounts and can count as a distinct active buyer in each of our marketplaces. We generate revenue when buyers order items from sellers, so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in GMS and revenue, the reach of our platform, awareness of our brand, the engagement and loyalty of buyers, and the health of our business.
Mobile GMS
Mobile GMS is GMS that results from a transaction completed on a mobile device, such as a tablet or a smartphone. Mobile GMS excludes orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop. When calculating the percentage of mobile GMS, we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions. We believe that mobile GMS indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow GMS and revenue.
International GMS
International GMS is GMS from transactions where either the billing address for the seller or the shipping address for the buyer at the time of sale is outside of the United States. When calculating percent international GMS, we do not take into account refunds associated with canceled transactions. We believe that international GMS shows the level of engagement of our community outside the United States and demonstrates our ability to grow GMS and revenue.
Currency-Neutral GMS Growth
We calculate currency-neutral GMS growth by translating current period GMS for goods sold that were listed in non-U.S. dollar currencies into U.S. dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates.
As reported and currency-neutral GMS growth for the periods presented below is as follows and include the operations of Reverb since August 15, 2019 (the date of acquisition):

------------------------- ----------- - ---------------- ---- --------- ---- --

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we provide Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income adjusted to exclude: interest and other non-operating expense, net; benefit for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; foreign exchange (gain) loss; acquisition-related expenses; non-ordinary course disputes; restructuring and other exit costs (income); and asset impairment charges. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.
We have included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation, and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platform.
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect other non-operating expenses, net of other non-operating income, including net interest expense;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of foreign exchange (gain) loss;

- --------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related expenses;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of non-ordinary course disputes;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of restructuring and other exit costs (income);

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of asset impairment charges;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and our other GAAP results.

(6) In the fourth quarter of 2017, we made the decision to discontinue certain product offerings, including Etsy Studio and Etsy Manufacturing, which resulted in the recognition of a $3.2 million impairment charge to write the related capitalized web development and internal-use software assets down to zero. This decision was based on our strategy to focus on the growth of the Etsy.com marketplace.

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” Our primary marketplace, Etsy.com, is the largest driver of our business and thus the following key factors affecting our performance most significantly relate to the Etsy marketplace.
Growth and Retention of Active Buyers and Active Sellers on the Etsy Marketplace
Our success depends in part on the growth and retention of our active buyers and active sellers. Our revenue is driven by the number of active buyers, buyer engagement, active sellers, seller engagement, and our ability to maintain a trusted marketplace. We believe two of our most significant opportunities to drive growth in our primary marketplace are to bring new buyers to Etsy.com and encourage existing Etsy buyers to purchase more frequently. We are particularly focused on increasing our number of habitual buyers, or buyers who have spent $200 or more and made purchases on six or more purchase days in the year. We are also focused on keeping our best sellers on the platform and helping them grow their businesses by enhancing the seller tools and services that help drive buyer demand.

During 2019, the Etsy marketplace had 19 million new Etsy buyers, or buyers who made their first-ever purchase on Etsy. GMS from new buyers was up 11% year-over-year and represented approximately 16% of overall Etsy.com GMS, a decrease compared to last year. Etsy.com GMS from existing buyers grew 24% year-over-year in 2019 and represented approximately 84% of overall Etsy.com GMS, an increase compared to last year. Repeat purchases demonstrate the loyalty of Etsy buyers. In 2019, on the Etsy marketplace, approximately 41.4% of our active buyers made purchases on two or more days in the previous 12 months, up from 40.1% in 2018.
Habitual buyers represented approximately 5.5% of Etsy.com’s active buyers as of December 31, 2019. Habitual buyers grew to 2.5 million as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 22.9% compared to 2018. We aim to increase repeat purchases and habitual buyers by inspiring purchases in additional categories and on additional occasions, building trust in the Etsy brand, and removing friction from the buying experience to improve conversion rates.
To analyze our retention rates on the Etsy marketplace, we measure repeat activity by active buyers and active sellers.

Etsy Cohort of 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, and 2012 Active Sellers

These cohort data demonstrate our success in retaining sellers over a multi-year period, with the sellers that remain on our platform maintaining consistent GMS growth. We believe there is significant opportunity for growth by fueling seller success through continued investment in paid services and tools to help Etsy sellers generate more sales on our platform.

Services Growth
We have a seller-aligned business model: we make money when sellers make money. Our goal is to enhance the seller tools and services that will drive buyer demand. To achieve this, we continue to invest our resources in developing a cohesive platform of paid services and free tools specifically designed to help our creative entrepreneurs generate more sales and scale their businesses. We believe we can grow our optional paid services in three ways: expand the utility of existing services, expand the geographic reach of existing services, and launch new services offerings. As of December 31, 2019, on the Etsy marketplace, 16.6% of active sellers used advertising services, and 22.9% of active sellers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia used Etsy Shipping Labels.
Investment in Marketing
We are focusing on initiatives to drive traffic to Etsy and shape perceptions of the Etsy marketplace as the go-to shopping destination for special purchases and special purchase occasions by investing primarily in digital and other marketing initiatives, such as search engine optimization and television channels, and in our team to support marketing activities. We believe that we can continue to grow our acquisition marketing efforts, both in scaling and improving our current efforts and by expanding into new marketing channels. In 2019, Paid GMS was 15% of total Etsy.com GMS and grew 7% compared to 2018. Paid GMS only reflects Etsy.com GMS related to performance marketing spend and excludes brand marketing channels such as TV. In 2018, we ran our first-ever Etsy television advertising campaign in the United States and also began to test offline marketing campaigns. We continued these marketing campaigns during 2019. We believe these campaigns can increase brand awareness, visits, and purchase intent.
In 2019, we spent $215.6 million on marketing expenses, or 26.3% of revenue, up 36.4% over 2018. In 2018, we spent $158.0 million on marketing expenses, or 26.2% of revenue, up 44.9% over 2017. We increased digital marketing spend, which excludes brand marketing channels such as TV, by 19% in 2019 to $134.0 million, including $129.3 million of which was spend for the Etsy marketplace, up 15% from 2018.
Investment in Technology
Our engineering team has built a platform that enables millions of Etsy sellers and buyers to smoothly transact across borders, languages and devices. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our platform to attract buyers and sellers to the Etsy marketplace and enhance their experience.
In September 2016, we acquired Blackbird Technologies, Inc., (“Blackbird”), a machine learning company, and, during 2017, fully integrated it into our search team. During 2017, we launched Context Specific Ranking (“CSR”), which leverages our internal data to create a more personalized search experience. On the Etsy marketplace, we continued to improve the search experience using CSR throughout 2018 and migrated to non-linear search models in 2019. We completed our migration to Google Cloud in February 2020, and our technology infrastructure allows us to scale our efforts across the platform. We expect to continue to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to enable shoppers to more easily browse, filter and transact on the Etsy marketplace, even when they may not have something specific in mind.
In 2019, we spent $121.9 million on product development expenses, or 14.9% of revenue, up 25.3% over 2018, and in 2018 we spent $97.2 million on product development expenses, or 16.1% of revenue, up 30.3% over 2017. In addition, we capitalized website development and internal-use software costs of $8.7 million and $22.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, on a consolidated basis. Additionally, in 2019 we acquired developed technology valued at $30.3 million in the Reverb acquisition. We plan to continue to invest in innovation to address the needs of our community and increase our efforts to recruit and hire employees to work on our engineering teams.
Investment in Connected Experience—Mobile and Desktop
We want to engage buyers wherever they are and to provide an enjoyable and accessible shopping experience no matter what device they use to access our marketplaces. Mobile is integrated into everything that we do, and expanding our mobile capabilities is an important focus area. Our mobile websites and mobile apps include search, discovery, curation, personalization, and social shopping features, optimized for a personal mobile experience. Etsy.com mobile GMS was 59% of total Etsy.com GMS in 2019, up from 55% in 2018. We are focused on increasing conversion rates in general; however, we are particularly focused on mobile web, which continued to be the largest driver of overall visits growth. If mobile web visits continue to grow as a percentage of overall visits, it could be a headwind to future conversion rate gains. We are focused on continuing to enhance the buyer experience through mobile offering improvements in 2020.

International Growth
Our growth will depend in part on international sellers and international buyers constituting an increasing portion of our community. Our vision is global and local. Our websites are available in many languages and supports buyers and sellers in nearly every country in the world. In 2018, we entered into a referral agreement with DaWanda GmbH (“DaWanda”), a privately held Germany-based marketplace for gifts and handmade items. As part of this agreement, DaWanda agreed to encourage its community of buyers and sellers to migrate to the Etsy platform. The referral agreement with DaWanda allowed us to grow our international business by expanding our footprint in Central Europe, particularly in Germany, one of our core geographic markets.
On a consolidated basis, international GMS was 36% of total GMS in 2019 compared to 35% in 2018.
For the Etsy marketplace, we expect international GMS to continue to grow faster than U.S. GMS in 2020, assuming that currency rates remain stable compared to average levels in December 2019, driven by our efforts to build local communities and foster local connections. In 2019, 40% of Etsy sellers were located outside the United States. Cross-border transactions is the largest component of international GMS and we remain committed to reducing barriers such as language and currency so that sellers and buyers from different countries can easily connect and transact. For the Etsy marketplace, GMS generated between a non-U.S. buyer and a non-U.S. seller both in the same country grew approximately 37% in 2019 compared with 2018, making it the fastest growing category of international GMS. The Reverb marketplace has a smaller percent of international GMS relative to the Etsy marketplace.
We are focused on building local marketplaces globally, and deepening local communities around the world, each with its own ecosystem of sellers and buyers. To execute on our international strategy, we plan to continue to invest in local marketing and other locally-relevant tools and enhancements, such as local search boost, to encourage these connections around the world.
Our Company Culture
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate exceptional employees who share our dedication to our community and our mission to “Keep Commerce Human.” We believe that our action-oriented, values-based and purpose-driven work culture is a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent.
We are focused on employee engagement, which is linked with high performance, retention, innovation, and growth. We are also committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace because we firmly believe that diverse backgrounds, thoughts, and experiences are beneficial to innovation, decision making, and our business as a whole. We are proud that as of December 31, 2019, our Board of Directors and leadership were at least 50% female.

Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
Our revenue consists of Marketplace revenue and Services revenue.
Etsy.com Marketplace revenue.  Marketplace revenue is primarily comprised of the 5% transaction fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction, inclusive of shipping fees charged, the listing fee of $0.20 she pays for each item she lists (for up to four months) on Etsy.com, and Etsy Payments, our payment processing service. On July 16, 2018, we increased our seller transaction fee from 3.5% to 5%, and now apply it to the cost of shipping in addition to the cost of the item. Etsy Payments processing fees vary between 3.0% to 4.5% of an item’s total sale price, including shipping, plus a flat fee per order, depending on the country in which a seller’s bank account is located. The Company earns additional fees on transactions in which currency conversions are performed. Marketplace revenue also includes revenue generated through our commercial partnerships, which was recorded in its own Other revenue line prior to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Reverb.com Marketplace revenue. The Reverb seller transaction fee is a variable fee, which is 3.5% of each completed transaction, including both the cost of the item and the shipping. There are no Reverb listing fees. Variable fees also include payments fees for processing payments, including foreign currency payments. Payments processing fees vary between 2.5% - 2.7% of an item’s total sale price, including shipping, plus a flat fee per order, depending on the currency in which a listing is denominated.

Etsy.com Services revenue.  Services revenue is derived from optional services offered to sellers, which primarily include advertising services and shipping labels.

• Revenue from Promoted Listings, our on-site advertising service, consists of cost-per-click fees an Etsy seller pays us for prominent placement of her listings in search results in our marketplace. In the third quarter of 2019, Etsy streamlined Promoted Listings and Google Shopping, an off-site marketing tool for Etsy sellers, into one unified ad platform called Etsy Ads, where Etsy sellers can set a budget, which allows Etsy to allocate that budget between channels, targeting optimal return on seller spend. Due to this new offering, Etsy no longer offered its Promoted Listings service as a standalone advertising service after September 30, 2019. Revenue from Etsy Ads consists of cost-per-click fees, which are nonrefundable and are charged to a seller’s Etsy bill when the ad is clicked. The revenue that we recognize related to Etsy Ads is recorded on a gross basis in Services revenue with an offsetting expense recorded in cost of revenue.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Revenue from shipping labels consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she purchases shipping labels directly through our platform, net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels. We are able to provide our sellers shipping labels from the United States Postal Service, FedEx, Canada Post, Royal Mail, and DAI Post at discounted pricing due to the volume of purchases through our platform.

Reverb.com Services revenue.  Reverb has its own on-site advertising service called Bump advertising. Reverb sellers have the ability to determine their own ad rate as a percentage of their item’s final sale price. Reverb also provides its sellers access to purchase shipping labels at discounted pricing due to the volume of purchases through its platform. Revenue from shipping labels consists of fees a Reverb seller pays us when they purchase shipping labels directly through the Reverb platform, net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels.
Our revenue recognition policies are discussed under “Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates.”
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue primarily consists of the cost of interchange and other fees for credit card processing services, credit card verification service fees, and credit card chargebacks to support payments revenue, and costs of refunds made to buyers that we are not able to collect from sellers. Cost of revenue also includes expenses associated with the usage of cloud infrastructure, including employee-related costs, hosting and bandwidth costs, and depreciation and amortization. With the shift to Etsy Ads in the third quarter of 2019, amounts spent on Google Shopping, which were previously recorded on a net basis in Other revenue, are recorded on a gross basis in Services revenue with an offsetting expense recorded in cost of revenue. Our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may change over time as our revenue mix changes; for example, to the extent that payments revenue increases as a percentage of revenue, there may be a dampening effect on our gross margin, as our payments services are lower margin products compared to our other offerings.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses consist of marketing, product development, general and administrative expenses, and asset impairment charges. Direct and indirect employee-related expenses are the most significant component of the product development and general and administrative expense categories. We include stock-based compensation expense in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient’s function. We include restructuring and other exit costs (income) related to the Actions in the applicable operating expense category of the impacted function.
Marketing:  Marketing expenses largely consist of direct marketing and indirect employee-related expenses to support our marketing initiatives. Direct marketing includes digital marketing, brand marketing, television and video, public relations and communications, market research, marketing partnerships, and customer relationship management. Digital marketing, also referred to as performance marketing, primarily consists of targeted promotional campaigns through electronic channels, such as product listing ads, search engine marketing, affiliate programs, display advertising and social channels, which are focused on buyer acquisition and retargeting.
Product development:  Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our engineering, product management, product design, and product research activities. Additional expenses include consulting costs related to the development, quality assurance, and testing of new technology and enhancement of our existing technology.

General and administrative.  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses for our general corporate functions. General and administrative expenses also include costs associated with the use of facilities and equipment, including depreciation and amortization and office overhead, and certain professional services expenses.

Asset impairment charges: Asset impairment charges consist primarily of non-cash charges related to our decisions to discontinue certain product offerings and the impairment of the related capitalized web development and internal-use software costs.
Other (Expense) Income, net
Other (expense) income, net consists of interest expense, interest and other income, and foreign exchange gain (loss). Interest expense consists primarily of non-cash interest and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 and 2026. As part of the adoption of ASU 2016-02—Leases in the first quarter of 2019, interest expense includes interest associated with our Brooklyn headquarters lease, and, to a lesser extent, interest on our hosting and computer equipment leases, both accounted for as finance leases. Prior to 2019, interest expense included interest associated with the build-to-suit accounting treatment of our Brooklyn headquarters lease, and, to a lesser extent, interest on our hosting and computer equipment leases, accounted for as capital lease obligations. Interest and other income is primarily comprised of interest and dividend income from our investment accounts.
Benefit for Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate and the benefit for income taxes is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax income or loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, taxable income and loss in each jurisdiction, changes in our stock price, audit-related developments, acquisitions, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the magnitude of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pre-tax income is lower.
Although management believes its tax positions and related provisions reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements are fully supportable, it recognizes that these tax positions and related provisions may be challenged by various tax authorities. These tax positions and related provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as additional facts and information become available, including progress on tax audits, changes in interpretation of tax laws, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. To the extent that the results differ from our original or adjusted estimates of the Company, the effect will be recorded in (provision) benefit for income taxes.
The (provision) benefit for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the we operate. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions, timing and amount of income and deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. Any adjustments as a result of any examination may result in additional taxes or penalties against us. If the ultimate result of these audits differ from original or adjusted estimates, they could have a material impact on our tax provision and results of operations.

GMS increased $1.0 billion, or 26.5%, to $5.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $242.4 million related to the results of Reverb, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. On a currency-neutral basis (excluding the direct impact of currency translation on GMS from goods that are not listed in U.S. dollars) GMS growth for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been 27.5%, or approximately 100 basis points higher than the reported 26.5% growth. Supporting this growth in GMS, active sellers increased 27.6% to 2.7 million, driven in large part by growth in international sellers and the acquisition of Reverb, and active buyers increased 17.5% to 46.4 million at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. In the year ended December 31, 2019, GMS from new buyers grew 16% year-over-year and represented approximately 17% of overall GMS, a decrease compared to last year. In the year ended December 31, 2019, GMS from existing buyers grew 37% year-over-year and represented approximately 83% of overall GMS, an increase compared to last year. We anticipate continued visit growth and improved conversion in 2020. We believe conversion improvements will be driven primarily by product launches enhancing the buyer experience.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, mobile GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to approximately 58% up from approximately 55% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Mobile GMS growth during the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately 34%, with mobile web and mobile app GMS each continuing to grow faster than desktop GMS during the year.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, international GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to approximately 36%, up from approximately 35% for the year ended December 31, 2018. International GMS was up approximately 32% in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by our fastest growing international trade route, international domestic, which is GMS generated between a non-U.S. buyer and a non-U.S. seller both in the same country, and by GMS between U.S. buyers and international sellers. International domestic GMS grew approximately 40% in 2019 compared with 2018. The increase in international GMS was partially offset by decreases related to changes in foreign currency rates year-over-year. On a currency-neutral basis international GMS growth for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been 37%. We expect international GMS to continue to grow faster than U.S. GMS on a currency-neutral basis, driven by our global product enhancements and marketing.
Revenue increased $214.7 million, or 35.6%, to $818.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $19.1 million related to the results of Reverb, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, of which 72.5% consisted of Marketplace revenue and 27.5% consisted of Services revenue.
Marketplace revenue increased $148.9 million, or 33.5%, to $593.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This growth corresponded with a 26.5% increase in GMS to a total of $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Marketplace revenue increased at a faster rate than GMS primarily due to the increase in transaction revenue and payments revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Transaction revenue increased 48.9% year-over-year, primarily driven by our 2018 pricing updates, which drove approximately 30% of the 48.9% increase. Payments revenue increased 25.7%, largely driven by overall GMS growth trends. The share of Etsy.com GMS processed through our Etsy Payments platform was 89% for the year ended December 31, 2019, up from 86% for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the transition of sellers in eligible countries to the platform. Listing fee revenue grew 16.6%, driven by an increase in charged listings year-over-year corresponding with the increase in overall GMS growth. Marketplace revenue also increased due to the acquisition of Reverb.

Services revenue increased $65.8 million, or 41.4%, to $224.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The growth in Services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in advertising revenue (formerly referred to as Promoted Listings and Google Shopping), up 51.3%. We launched our new unified ad platform, Etsy Ads, in the third quarter of 2019, which combines Promoted Listings, Etsy.com’s on-site ads platform, and Google Shopping, an off-site marketing tool for Etsy.com sellers. With the shift to Etsy Ads, amounts spent on Google Shopping, which were previously recorded on a net basis in Other revenue, are recorded on a gross basis in Services revenue with an offsetting expense recorded in cost of revenue. The increase in advertising revenue was due to higher click volume and revenue from Google Shopping. At December 31, 2019, 16.6% of Etsy active sellers used Etsy advertising services.

 (in thousands, except percentages)
Cost of revenue $ 271,036 $ 190,762 $ 80,274 42.1 %
Percentage of total revenue 33.1 % 31.6 %

Cost of revenue increased $80.3 million, or 42.1%, to $271.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by increased costs related to processing Etsy Payments, corresponding to the increase in Etsy Payments revenue, and increased costs related to the Google Shopping portion of the new Etsy Ads platform. With the shift to Etsy Ads, Google Shopping expense is recorded in cost of revenue, but was previously recorded on a net basis in Other revenue. The increase in cost of revenue was also driven by increased cloud-related hosting and bandwidth costs, the cost of revenue associated with the Reverb business, which includes amortization expense for developed technology, and, to a lesser extent, employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, primarily driven by increases in average salary and headcount. We spent approximately $30 million on cloud migration in 2019, which includes implementation costs and costs related to cloud usage for growth initiatives, and completed the migration in February 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2020, Etsy will no longer recognize costs related to the Google Shopping portion of the original Etsy Ads platform in Cost of Revenue, but will instead recognize the costs related to Offsite Ads in Marketing expense.
Operating Expenses
There were a total of 1,240 employees on December 31, 2019, of which 184 were Reverb employees, compared with 874 on December 31, 2018.

Marketing $ 215,570 $ 158,013 $ 57,557 36.4 %

Marketing expenses increased $57.6 million, or 36.4%, to $215.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily a result of increased spend related to buyer acquisition, including the launch of our holiday television ad campaign, and the acquisition of Reverb. Paid GMS was 15% of overall Etsy.com GMS in the year ended December 31, 2019, down from paid GMS of 17% in the year ended December 31, 2018, which we believe is a result of our television ad campaigns driving more organic traffic. In 2020, we expect to increase our investment in marketing, including into channels such as television. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, Marketing expense will include costs related to our new Offsite Ads product.

Product development expenses increased $24.6 million, or 25.3%, to $121.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, mainly the result of an increase in average headcount. This increase was also driven, to a lesser extent, by a decrease in the amount of employee-related costs capitalized as a result of several larger project launches in 2018, mainly related to cloud migration.

General and administrative expenses increased $38.3 million, or 46.2%, to $121.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to increased amortization expense related to the change in accounting treatment for our Brooklyn headquarters lease associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-02—Leases in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses is also driven by increased bad debt expense, primarily related to countries not covered by Etsy Payments. Additionally, there were increases in professional services as well as employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, which were mainly the result of an increase in average headcount.

Our income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $15.2 million and $22.4 million, respectively.

The primary drivers of our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 were excess tax benefits from employee stock-based compensation of $16.3 million, and a benefit related to research and development tax credit of $9.9 million, partially offset by tax expense on pretax book income of $11.5 million.

The primary driver of our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 were tax benefit related to valuation allowance of $28.7 million, stock-based compensation of $11.7 million, and our research and development tax credit of $4.1 million. These were partially offset by tax expense related to income before income taxes of $11.3 million, state and local tax expense of $3.8 million, and the inclusion of additional taxes of $3.9 million due to certain tax provision introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as enacted by the U.S. Federal Government on December 22, 2017, (the “TCJA”).

For both periods, other drivers include the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates.

GMS increased $678.1 million, or 20.8%, to $3.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. On a currency-neutral basis (excluding the direct impact of currency translation on GMS from goods that are not listed in U.S. dollars) GMS growth for the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been 20.4%, or approximately 40 basis points lower than the reported 20.8% growth. Supporting this growth in GMS, active sellers increased 9.4% to 2.1 million and active buyers increased 18.2% to 39.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. In the year ended December 31, 2018, GMS from new buyers increased 16% year-over-year and represented approximately 18% of overall GMS, a decrease compared to last year. In the year ended December 31, 2018, GMS from existing buyers increased 23% year-over-year and represented approximately 82% of overall GMS, an increase compared to last year.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, mobile GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to approximately 55%, up from approximately 51% for the year ended December 31, 2017. We believe this increase was a result of increased mobile traffic, and, to a lesser extent, continued improvements in our mobile offerings for Etsy buyers. Mobile GMS growth during the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 30%, with mobile web and mobile app GMS each continuing to grow faster than desktop GMS during the year.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, international GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to 35%, up from approximately 33% for the year ended December 31, 2017. International GMS was up approximately 28% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, driven by GMS between U.S. buyers and international sellers and by our fastest growing international trade route, international domestic, which is GMS generated between a non-U.S. buyer and a non-U.S. seller both in the same country. International domestic GMS grew approximately 36% in 2018 compared with 2017. On a currency-neutral basis international GMS growth for the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been 27%.
Revenue increased $162.5 million, or 36.8%, to $603.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, of which 73.7% consisted of Marketplace revenue and 26.3% consisted of Services revenue.
Marketplace revenue increased $115.4 million, or 35.0%, to $444.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This growth corresponded with a 20.8% increase in GMS to a total of $3.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2018. Marketplace revenue increased at a faster rate than GMS primarily due to the increase in transaction revenue and Etsy Payments revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Transaction revenue increased 59.6% year-over-year, primarily driven by our 2018 pricing updates, which drove approximately 41% of the 59.6% increase. Etsy Payments revenue increased 24.4%, largely driven by overall GMS growth trends and increased seller adoption. The share of GMS processed through our Etsy Payments platform was 86%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, up from 85% in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the transition of sellers in eligible countries to the platform. During the second quarter of 2018, we reached the anniversary of the Etsy Payments adoption requirement, which has been a substantial driver of year-over-year Etsy Payments revenue growth, and therefore, we expect Etsy Payments to grow more closely in-line with year-over-year GMS growth in future quarters. Listing fee revenue grew 17.0%, driven by an increase in charged listings year-over-year corresponding with the increase in overall GMS growth. Listing fee revenue increased at a slower rate than GMS primarily due to the issuance of free listings in our international markets, including France and Germany.

Services revenue increased $47.1 million, or 42.1%, to $158.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The growth in Services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in Promoted Listings, up 41.4%, and, to a lesser extent, Etsy Shipping Labels, up 39.9%. The increase in Promoted Listings revenue was due to higher click volume and overall product enhancements, including expansion of Promoted Listing budgets and context specific ranking on Promoted Listings, which increased the relevance of promoted ads in our search results. The increase in Etsy Shipping Label revenue was primarily driven by a combination of an increase in label volume and an increase in average margin per label. Additionally, Etsy Shipping Label revenue reflects a one-time adjustment to recognize prior period revenue which drove $2.8 million of the increase. At December 31, 2018, 15.1% of active sellers used Promoted Listings, and 24.7% of active sellers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia used Etsy Shipping Labels.

Cost of revenue increased $39.8 million, or 26.3%, to $190.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by additional costs as a result of the increase in transactions and related revenue generated on the Etsy platform. The remaining increase was driven by hosting and bandwidth costs incurred as a result of our migration to the cloud while also maintaining our current infrastructure, and, to a lesser extent, increases in employee-related and professional services expenses. Cost of revenue decreased as a percentage of revenue largely due to 2018 changes in our pricing.

This decision was based on our strategy to focus on the growth of the Etsy.com marketplace.

The increase in expense was primarily driven by the change in U.S. Dollar to Euro exchange rates on our intercompany and other non-functional currency balances, and higher interest expense, mainly non-cash interest related to our convertible debt issued in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by increased interest and dividend income related to our investment accounts. Interest expense also includes non-cash interest expense associated with the build-to-suit lease accounting related to our corporate headquarters, which remained flat year-over-year.

Benefit (provision) for income taxes $ 22,413 $ 49,535 $ (27,122 ) 54.8 %
Percentage of total revenue 3.7 % 11.2 %

Our income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $22.4 million and $49.5 million, respectively.
The primary driver of the income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 were tax benefit related to valuation allowance of $28.7 million, stock-based compensation of $11.7 million, and our research and development tax credit of $4.1 million. These were partially offset by tax expense related to income before income taxes of $11.3 million, state and local tax expense of $3.8 million, and the inclusion of additional taxes of $3.9 million due to certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, as enacted by the U.S. Federal Government on December 22, 2017 (the “TCJA”).
The primary drivers of our income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was the impact on deferred taxes from the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018. As a result of the TCJA, which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, our deferred taxes and certain unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2017 have been revalued at the reduced 21% rate. The revaluation resulted in a benefit for income taxes of approximately $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The secondary driver of the income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was the recognition of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09—Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting in the first quarter of 2017. As a result of this updated guidance, we recorded $12.8 million of excess tax benefits, rather than additional paid-in capital, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
For both periods, other drivers include the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, the disallowance of the benefit of losses in certain foreign jurisdictions and the amount of non-deductible stock-based compensation expense.

(6) In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an income tax benefit associated with the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance release resulted in a non-recurring benefit for income taxes of $23.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(7) Since the Company expects to settle in cash the principal outstanding under the 2019 Notes (see “Note 13—Debt”), we use the treasury stock method when calculating the potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. We used the if-converted method when calculating the dilutive effect of the 2018 Notes for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 and used the treasury stock method for the three months ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019, and all quarterly periods in 2018.

Seasonality
Etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more Services during the fourth-quarter holiday shopping season. This has resulted in increased GMS and revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, which can compare to lower GMS and revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. For example, revenue in the first quarter of 2019 decreased when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect this seasonality to continue in future years. Our cost of revenue and marketing expenses also follow this trend, with the highest costs corresponding with the fourth quarter and lower costs in the first quarter of each fiscal year. As our growth rates moderate, the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced.
Our quarterly revenue increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for all periods presented above, other than the first quarter of 2019, corresponding to our GMS performance in the same periods. We cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue and GMS growth will continue. We believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare year-over-year results than sequential quarter-over-quarter results.

Net working capital 732,510 568,227

As of December 31, 2019, our cash and cash equivalents, a majority of which were held in cash deposits and money market funds, were held in the United States for future investments, working capital funding, and general corporate purposes.

We invest in short- and long-term instruments, including fixed-income funds and U.S. Government and agency securities aligned with our investment strategy. These investments are intended to allow us to preserve our principal, maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs, deliver positive yields across a balanced portfolio, and continue to provide us with direct fiduciary control. In accordance with our investment policy, all investments have maturities no longer than 37 months, with the average maturity of these investments maintained at 12 months or less.

Sources of Liquidity
In September 2019, we issued the 2019 Notes pursuant to the Securities Act. The initial conversion price of the 2019 Notes represented a premium of approximately 47.5% over the price of Etsy's common stock. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Notes were $639.5 million after deducting initial purchasers' discount and offering expenses. The 2019 Notes will mature on October 1, 2026, unless earlier converted or repurchased. For more information on the 2019 Notes, see “Note 13—Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On February 25, 2019, we entered into a $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a Credit Agreement with several lenders (the “2019 Credit Agreement”). The 2019 Credit Agreement will mature in February 2024. The 2019 Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of $30.0 million and a swingline loan sublimit of $10.0 million. See “Note 13—Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
In March 2018, we issued the 2018 Notes pursuant to the Securities Act. The initial conversion price of the 2018 Notes represented a premium of approximately 37.5% over the price of Etsy’s common stock. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2018 Notes were $335.0 million after deducting initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses. The 2018 Notes will mature on March 1, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased. Based on the daily closing prices of our common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, holders of the 2018 Notes are not eligible to convert their 2018 Notes during the first quarter of 2020. When a conversion notice is received, we have the option to pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof. Accordingly, we cannot be required to settle the 2018 Notes in cash and, therefore, the 2018 Notes are classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2019. For more information on the 2018 Notes, see “Note 13—Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in “Key Factors Affecting Our Performance” above and in our “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The majority of our cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments are held in the United States. We fund our international operations from our funds held in the United States on an as-needed basis.

Financing activities 359,607 144,006 6,555

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our cash flows from operations are largely dependent on the amount of revenue generated on our platform, as well as associated cost of revenue and other operating expenses. Our primary source of cash from operating activities is cash collections from our customers. Net cash provided by operating activities in each period presented has been influenced by changes in working capital.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $206.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by cash net income of $196.9 million as a result of increased revenue generated on our platform, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that provided $10.0 million in cash, driven by the timing of payables offset by prepayments made in the period and collections of accounts receivable.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $198.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily driven by cash net income of $139.6 million as a result of increased revenue generated on our platform, and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that provided $59.3 million in cash, largely driven by timing of collections of accounts receivable due to the launch of our redesigned payment account in the fourth quarter of 2018, which now automatically deducts our fees and applicable taxes from the seller’s funds earned through sales using Etsy Payments prior to settlement of those funds to the seller’s bank account and payment timing of payables.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $69.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by cash net income of $68.8 million as a result of increased revenue generated on our platform and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that provided $0.3 million in cash.
Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities
Our primary investing activities consist of cash paid in the acquisition of Reverb, sales and purchases of short- and long-term marketable securities, cash paid to purchase intangible assets and capital expenditures, including investments in capitalized website development and internal-use software and purchases of property and equipment to support our overall business growth.
Net cash used in investing activities was $488.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily attributable to $270.4 million in cash paid to acquire Reverb, net purchases of marketable securities of $200.7 million, and $15.3 million in capital expenditures, including $7.8 million for website development and internal-use software as we continued to invest in projects adding new features and functionality to the Etsy platform and focused on growth investments, such as our migration to Google Cloud.
Net cash used in investing activities was $285.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $229.3 million, $35.3 million in cash paid for the DaWanda intangible asset acquisition, and $20.6 million in capital expenditures, including $19.5 million for website development and internal-use software.

Net cash provided by investing activities was $61.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This was primarily attributable to net sales of marketable securities of $75.0 million, offset by $13.2 million in capital expenditures, including $9.2 million for capitalized website development and internal-use software and $4.0 million for purchases of property and equipment.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $359.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 Notes of $650.0 million, partially offset by stock repurchases of $177.0 million, payments of $76.2 million for the 2019 Capped Call Transactions, payment of tax obligations on vested equity awards of $32.5 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $11.9 million and payments on finance lease obligations of $10.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $9.8 million.

Total contractual obligations $ 1,199,439 $ 51,027 $ 96,181 $ 377,881 $ 674,350

Finance lease obligations consist of obligations under finance leases for computer and hosting equipment and the portion of our headquarters in Brooklyn, New York that is accounted for as a finance lease.
Operating lease obligations consist of obligations under non-cancelable operating leases for our headquarters in Brooklyn, New York and for our offices in San Francisco, Hudson (New York), Chicago, Dublin, and London.
Long-term obligations primarily consist of the issuance of Convertible Senior Notes in 2019 and 2018, which will mature on October 1, 2026 and March 1, 2023, respectively, unless earlier converted or repurchased.
Interest payments consist of interest due in connection with our 2019 Notes.
Purchase obligations consist of commitments related to cloud computing and other support services. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate what the total obligation may be beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing.
In addition, we have uncertain tax positions of $19.9 million and non-income tax related contingency reserves of $7.2 million, which amounts are not reflected in the table as the ultimate resolution and timing are uncertain. These non-income tax contingency reserves include $4.8 million due to the acquisition of Reverb, which is wholly offset by an indemnification asset of $3.7 million and a deferred tax asset of $1.1 million.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.
We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with stock-based compensation; income taxes, including the evaluation of uncertain tax positions; purchase price allocations for business combinations, valuation of the acquired intangibles purchased in a business combination, and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; leases, including determining the incremental borrowing rate; and fair value of financial instruments have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see “Note 1—Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenue is diversified; generated from a mix of marketplace activities and other optional services to help sellers generate more sales and scale their businesses. We recognize revenue as we transfer control of promised goods or services to sellers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we obtain control of the specified goods or services by considering if we are primarily responsible for fulfillment of the promise, have inventory

risk, and have latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers, among other factors. Based on our evaluation of these factors, revenue is recorded either gross or net of costs associated with the transaction. With the exception of shipping labels, our revenues are recognized on a gross basis. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues.
Etsy.com Marketplace revenue: As members of the Etsy.com marketplace, Etsy sellers receive the benefit of marketplace activities, including listing items for sale, completing sales transactions, and payments processing, which represents a single stand-ready performance obligation. Etsy sellers pay a fixed listing fee of $0.20 for each item listed on Etsy.com for a period of four months or, if earlier, until a sale occurs. Variable fees include the 5% transaction fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction, inclusive of shipping fees charged, and fees for processing payments, including foreign currency payments. On July 16, 2018, we increased our seller transaction fee from 3.5% to 5% of each completed transaction, and now apply it to the cost of shipping in addition to the cost of the item. Payments processing fees vary between 3.0% to 4.5% of an item’s total sale price, including shipping, plus a flat fee per order, depending on the country in which a seller’s bank account is located. When a foreign currency payment is processed, an additional transaction fee is applied.
The listing fee is recognized ratably over a four-month listing period, unless the item is sold or the seller re-lists it, at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized. The transaction fee and payments processing fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is consummated. Listing fees are nonrefundable while transaction fees and payments processing fees are recorded net of refunds.
Marketplace revenue also includes revenue generated through our commercial partnerships, which was recorded in its own Other revenue line prior to the fourth quarter of 2019.
Reverb.com Marketplace revenue: The Reverb seller transaction fee is a variable fee, which is 3.5% of each completed transaction, including both the cost of the item and the shipping. There are no Reverb listing fees. Variable fees also include payments fees for processing payments, including foreign currency payments. Payments processing fees vary between 2.5% - 2.7% of an item’s total sale price, including shipping, plus a flat fee per order, depending on the currency in which a listing is denominated.
Etsy.com Services revenue: Services revenue is derived from optional services we offer to Etsy sellers, which primarily include advertising services (formerly Promoted Listings) and shipping labels. Each service below represents an individual obligation that we must perform when an Etsy seller chooses to use the service.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Revenue from Promoted Listings, Etsy.com’s on-site advertising service, consists of cost-per-click fees an Etsy seller pays for prominent placement of her listings in search results in the Etsy.com marketplace. Promoted Listings fees are based on an auction system, which utilizes the budget that each Etsy seller sets when using Promoted Listings to determine the cost-per-click fee. Promoted Listing fees are nonrefundable and are charged to a seller’s Etsy bill when the Promoted Listing is clicked, at which time revenue is recognized. In the third quarter of 2019, Etsy streamlined Promoted Listings and Google Shopping, an off-site marketing tool for Etsy sellers, into one unified ad platform called Etsy Ads, where Etsy sellers can set a budget, which allows Etsy to allocate that budget between channels, targeting optimal return on seller spend. Due to this new offering, Etsy no longer offers its Promoted Listings service as a standalone advertising service after September 30, 2019. Revenue from Etsy Ads consists of cost-per-click fees, which are nonrefundable and are charged to a seller’s Etsy bill when the ad is clicked, at which time revenue is recognized. The revenue we recognize related to Etsy Ads is recorded on a gross basis in Services revenue with an offsetting expense recorded in Cost of Revenue.

• Revenue from shipping labels consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she purchases shipping labels through our platform, net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels. We provide our sellers access to purchase shipping labels from the United States Postal Service, FedEx, Canada Post, Royal Mail and DAI Post at discounted pricing due to the volume of purchases through its platform. We recognize shipping label revenue when an Etsy seller purchases a shipping label. We recognize shipping label revenue on a net basis as we are an agent in this arrangement and do not take control of shipping labels prior to transferring the labels to the Etsy Seller. Shipping label revenue is recorded net of refunds.

Reverb Services revenue: Reverb has its own on-site advertising service called Bump advertising. Reverb sellers have the ability to determine their own ad rate as a percentage of their item’s final sale price. Revenue from Bump advertising is recognized at the time the item is sold. Reverb also provides its sellers access to purchase shipping labels at discounted pricing due to the volume of purchases through its platform. Revenue from shipping labels consists of fees a Reverb seller pays when they purchase shipping labels directly through the Reverb platform, net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels. Reverb recognizes shipping label revenue when a Reverb seller purchases a shipping label. Reverb recognizes shipping label revenue on a net basis as it is an agent in this arrangement and does not take control of shipping labels prior to transferring the labels to the Reverb seller.

Stock-Based Compensation
We account for our stock-based compensation awards in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718—Compensation—Stock Compensation (“ASC 718”). Stock options and RSUs are awarded to employees and members of our Board of Directors and are measured at fair value at each grant date. For both options and RSUs, vesting is typically over a four-year period and is contingent upon continued employment on each vesting date. In general, options granted to newly-hired employees prior to July 2018 vest 25% after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36-month period. In general, RSUs granted to newly-hired employees prior to July 2018 vest 25% after the first year following the vesting commencement date, which is the first day of the fiscal quarter closest to the date of grant, and then vest ratably each quarter over the remaining 12-quarter period. In general, for current employees who received an additional grant prior to March 2018, options vest ratably each month over a 48-month period. In general, for current employees who received an additional grant prior to March 2018, RSUs vest ratably each quarter over a 16-quarter period following the vesting commencement date, which is the first day of the fiscal quarter closest to the date of grant.
Beginning in July 2018, in general, for newly-hired employees, both options and RSUs vest 25% after the first year of service and ratably each six-month period over a four-year period following the vesting commencement date, which is the first day of the month closest to the date of grant. Beginning in March 2018, in general, for current employees who receive an additional grant, both options and RSUs vest ratably each six-month period over a four-year period following the vesting commencement date.
Stock-based compensation cost is measured on the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award using a Black-Scholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee’s or director’s requisite service period on a straight-line basis. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on Nasdaq on the grant date. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. We expect to continue to grant stock options and RSUs in the future, and, to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase.
Key Assumptions
Our Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of the option, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.

• Fair Value of Our Common Stock: Prior to our initial public offering in April 2015, our Board of Directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each meeting at which awards were approved. The factors included: contemporaneous third-party valuations of our common stock; the prices, rights, preferences, and privileges of our preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; the prices of preferred stock sold by us to third-party investors in arms-length transactions; the prices of common stock sold to third-party investors by us and in secondary transactions or repurchased by us in arms-length transactions; the lack of marketability of our common stock; our operating and financial results; current business conditions and projections; and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given then prevailing market conditions. Since our initial public offering, we have used the market closing price for our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq to determine the fair value of our common stock.

• Expected Volatility: As we do not have a sufficient trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for Etsy and certain industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. Industry peers, which we have selected, consist of several public companies in the industry similar in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Risk-free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expected Term: The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. We base our expected term for awards issued to employees or members of our Board of Directors on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the stock option.

• Expected Dividend Yield: We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero.

In determining the fair value of stock options granted, the following weighted-average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for awards granted in the periods indicated:

Income Taxes
We account for the income tax benefit based on income before income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to settle. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to be realized.
On December 22, 2017 the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA requires us to make an accounting policy election of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) as a current period expense when incurred (the “period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into our measurement of our deferred taxes (the “deferred method”). We recorded tax expense related to GILTI in our effective tax rate beginning in 2018, and have elected to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI using the period cost method.
We account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement.
We recognize interest and penalties, if any, associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Business Combinations, Intangible Assets and Goodwill
In accordance with the guidance for business combinations, we determine whether a transaction is a business combination, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition.
Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including estimates of future revenue and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. Our estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any change in facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and impacts our preliminary estimates is recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of fair value of assets and liabilities whichever is earlier the adjustments will affect our earnings.
Acquisition-related expenses incurred by the Company in a business combination are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as an expense in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment

test. Management has determined that we have two operating segments, which qualify for aggregation as one reportable segment, for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. As a result, we have determined we have two reporting units. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired. As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test of the two reporting units conducted in the fourth quarter of 2019, no goodwill impairment was recognized.
We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we are then required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment.
The quantitative assessment involves comparing the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units with its respective book value, including goodwill. If we determine that the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, we determine that the book value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value, we would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
Leases
At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present. Operating leases are included in other assets, other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, finance lease obligations, current, and finance lease obligations, net of current portion on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, lease obligations and, if applicable, long-term lease obligations in the line items cited above. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with terms of one year or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease obligations and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. As the interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable, the Company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. The lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.
The components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components, including land, building, or other similar components; non-lease components, including common area maintenance, maintenance, consumables, or other similar components; and non-components, including property taxes, insurance, or other similar components. However, the Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components as a single component. The lease expense is recognized over the expected term on a straight-line basis.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
In accounting for the issuance of the 2019 and 2018 Notes discussed in “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources of Liquidity,” we used estimates and assumptions to calculate the carrying amounts of the liability and equity components by measuring the fair value of similar securities. See “Note 13—Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
