Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, subsection "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," for details of the judgments made for SSP.

Our indirect channel model includes both a two-tiered distribution structure, where Autodesk sells to distributors that subsequently sell to resellers, and a one-tiered structure where Autodesk sells directly to resellers. For these arrangements, transfer of control begins at the time access to our subscriptions is made available electronically to our customer, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. Judgment is required to determine whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to pay, regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers. If we were to change this assessment, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.

Costs To Obtain a Contract With a Customer

Sales commissions earned by our internal sales personnel and our reseller partners are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. The commission costs are capitalized and included in "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" and "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred costs are then amortized over the period of benefit. Autodesk determined that sales commissions earned by internal sales personnel that are related to contract renewals are commensurate with sales commissions earned on the initial contracts, and we determined the period of benefit to be the term of the respective customer contract. Commissions paid to our reseller partners that are related to contract renewals are not commensurate with commissions earned on the initial contract, and we determined the estimated period of benefit by taking into consideration customer retention data, customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Deferred costs are periodically reviewed for impairment. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Fair Value Measurement

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In determining the fair value of our investments, we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques. Inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;

Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require Autodesk to develop its own assumptions.

This hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. This is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities, which we consider to be Level 1 and Level 2 assets.

Key inputs for currency derivatives are spot rates, forward rates, interest rates, volatility, and credit default rates. The spot rate for each currency is the same spot rate used for all balance sheet translations at the measurement date. Autodesk reviews for any potential changes on a quarterly basis, in conjunction with our fiscal quarter-end close. It is Autodesk's assessment that the leveling best reflects current market activity when observing the pricing information for these assets. Autodesk's Level 2 securities and derivatives are valued primarily using observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company has elected to use the income approach to value derivatives using the observable Level 2 market expectations at measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount (discounted). Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient and when required, rates are interpolated from commonly quoted intervals published by market sources. See Note 3, "Financial Instruments" for information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Autodesk considers all highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at estimated fair value.

Marketable Securities and Privately Held Company Investments

Autodesk classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date. Generally, marketable securities with remaining maturities of less than 12 months are classified as short-term and marketable securities with remaining maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Autodesk may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes or in anticipation of credit deterioration.

Marketable securities are stated at fair value. Marketable securities maturing within one year that are not restricted are classified as current assets.

Autodesk determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. Autodesk carries all “available-for-sale securities” at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders’ equity (deficit) until disposition or maturity. Autodesk carries all “trading securities” at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, recorded in “Interest and other expense, net” in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method.

Privately held debt and equity securities (Level 3) are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires the Company's judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. These assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment. Whenever possible, we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available, when determining fair value.

 The carrying value is not adjusted for the Company's privately held equity securities if there are no observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. Under the measurement alternative method, these investments are measured at cost, less any impairments, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer in the current period. To determine if a transaction is deemed a similar investment, Autodesk considers the rights and obligations between the investments and the extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of those investments with additional consideration for the stage of development of the investee company. The fair value would then be adjusted positively or negatively based on available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing.

In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. In addition, the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including: the rights and obligations of the investments, the extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of those investments, and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee.

All of Autodesk’s marketable securities and privately held company investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. Non-marketable equity securities investments are assessed based on available information such as current cash positions, earnings and cash flow positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available market data. For any marketable debt securities, declines in fair value judged to be other-than-temporary on securities available for sale are included as a reduction to investment income. To determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, the Company evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income.

For Autodesk's quarterly impairment assessment of privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio, the analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis
of other key factors including: the investee’s financial metrics, the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones, market acceptance of the product or technology, other competitive products or technology in the market, general market conditions, management and governance structure of the investee, the investee’s liquidity, debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is impaired, the Company will record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Under its risk management strategy, Autodesk uses derivative instruments to manage its short-term exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that exist as part of ongoing business operations. Autodesk's general practice is to hedge a portion of transaction exposures primarily denominated in euros, Japanese yen, British pounds, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Singapore dollars, Swiss francs, Swedish krona and Czech koruna. These instruments generally have maturities between one and twelve months in the future. Autodesk uses foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments and foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedging but Autodesk does not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes.

The bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose Autodesk to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, Autodesk only contracts with counterparties who meet the Company's minimum requirements under its counterparty risk assessment process. Autodesk monitors counterparty risk on at least a quarterly basis and will adjust its exposure to various counterparties as necessary. Autodesk generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Autodesk does not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.

Autodesk accounts for these derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and carries them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair value through earnings.

In addition to these foreign currency contracts, Autodesk holds derivative instruments issued by privately held companies, which are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivatives consist of certain conversion options on the convertible debt securities held by Autodesk and an option to acquire a privately held company. These derivatives are recorded at fair value as of each balance sheet date and are recorded in “Other assets”. Changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized in “Interest and other expense, net”.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The assets and liabilities of Autodesk’s foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expense amounts are translated at exchange rates that approximate those rates in effect during the period in which the underlying transactions occur. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as other comprehensive income (loss).

Gains and losses realized from foreign currency transactions, those transactions denominated in currencies other than the foreign subsidiary’s functional currency, are included in "Interest and other expense, net". Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period, and non-monetary assets are remeasured based on historical exchange rates.

Foreign Currency Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges

Autodesk uses foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions. These currency collars and forward contracts are designated and documented as cash flow hedges. The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge contracts is assessed quantitatively using regression at inception and thereafter. To receive cash flow hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge relationship and the hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. The gains and losses on these hedges are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted revenue or expense is recognized. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction
does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, Autodesk reclassifies and discloses the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” to “Interest and other expense, net” in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements at that time. Derivative contracts and related gain (loss) are presented within "Net cash provided by operating activities" in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. See Note 3, "Financial Instruments" for additional information.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

 Autodesk uses foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, and cash. These forward contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each fiscal quarter with gains and losses recognized as “Interest and other expense, net”. These derivative instruments do not subject the Company to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivative instruments are intended to offset the gains or losses resulting from the revaluation and settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables, payables, and cash.
Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable, net, consisted of the following as of January 31:

 2020 2019
-------------------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ----- - -----
Trade accounts receivable $ 716.1 $ 529.3
Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts (4.9 ) (4.9 )
Product returns reserve (0.5 ) (0.3 )
Partner programs and other obligations (58.4 ) (49.8 )
Accounts receivable, net $ 652.3 $ 474.3

Allowances for uncollectible trade receivables are based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with problem accounts.

As part of the indirect channel model, Autodesk has a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period. The majority of these incentives are recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the transaction is billed and subsequently recognized as a reduction to subscription or maintenance revenue over the contract period. The remainder reduces subscription or maintenance revenue in the current period.

These incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments. Depending on how the payments are made, the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are treated on the balance sheet as either a reduction to accounts receivable or accounts payable.
Concentration of Credit Risk

Autodesk places its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with, and in the custody of, multiple diversified financial institutions globally with high credit ratings and limits the amounts invested with any one institution, type of security, and issuer. Autodesk’s primary commercial banking relationship is with Citigroup Inc. and its global affiliates. Citibank, N.A., an affiliate of Citigroup, is one of the lead lenders and an agent in the syndicate of Autodesk’s $650.0 million line of credit facility.

The bank counterparties to the derivative contracts potentially expose Autodesk to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, Autodesk only contracts with counterparties who meet the Company's minimum requirements under its counterparty risk assessment process. Autodesk monitors counterparty risk on at least a quarterly basis and will adjust its exposure to various counterparties as necessary. Autodesk generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, Autodesk does not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features.

Autodesk’s accounts receivable are derived from sales to a large number of resellers, distributors, and direct customers in the Americas, EMEA, and APAC geographies. Autodesk performs ongoing evaluations of these partners' and customers'
financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary, but generally does not require collateral from such parties. Total sales to the Company's largest distributor Tech Data Corporation, and its global affiliates (“Tech Data”), accounted for 35%, 35%, and 31% of Autodesk's net revenue for fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The majority of the net revenue from sales to Tech Data is for sales made outside of the United States. In addition, Tech Data accounted for 31% and 29% of trade accounts receivable as of January 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Ingram Micro Inc. ("Ingram Micro"), our second largest distributor, accounted for 10%, 11%, 8% of Autodesk's total net revenue for fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of Autodesk's total net revenue or trade accounts receivable for each of the respective periods.
Computer Equipment, Software, Furniture, and Leasehold Improvements, Net

Computer equipment, software, and furniture are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term. Depreciation expense was $51.0 million in fiscal 2020, $59.2 million in fiscal 2019, and $67.6 million in fiscal 2018.

Computer equipment, software, furniture, leasehold improvements and the related accumulated depreciation at January 31 were as follows:

 2020 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ ----- ---- ------ - -----
Computer hardware, at cost $ 159.7 $ 190.2
Computer software, at cost 64.0 66.7
Leasehold improvements, land and buildings, at cost 284.0 247.8
Furniture and equipment, at cost 69.0 67.2
Computer software, hardware, leasehold improvements, furniture, and equipment, at cost 576.7 571.9
Less: Accumulated depreciation (415.0 ) (422.2 )
Computer software, hardware, leasehold improvements, furniture, and equipment, net $ 161.7 $ 149.7

Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development activities, if material, and immediately expensed for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities. These capitalized costs are amortized straight-line over the software’s expected useful life, which is generally three years.

Software Development Costs

Software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development expenses. Autodesk defines establishment of technological feasibility as the completion of a working model. Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the period of general market availability of the products are capitalized and generally amortized over a three-year period, if material. Autodesk had no material capitalized software development costs at January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019.

Cloud Computing Arrangements

Autodesk enters into certain cloud-based software hosting arrangements that are accounted for as service contracts. Costs incurred for these arrangements are capitalized for application development activities, if material, and immediately expensed for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities. Autodesk amortizes the capitalized development costs straight-line over the fixed, non-cancellable term of the associated hosting arrangement plus any reasonably certain renewal periods. The capitalized costs are included in "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" and "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized costs were $22.3 million and $4.9 million at January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2019, respectively. Amortization expense was $1.2 million and nil at January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, respectively.
Other Intangible Assets, Net

Other intangible assets include developed technologies, customer relationships, trade names, patents, user lists and the related accumulated amortization. These assets are shown as “Developed technologies, net” and as part of “Other assets” in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The majority of Autodesk’s other intangible assets are amortized to expense over the estimated economic life of the product, which ranges from two to ten years. Amortization expense for developed technologies, customer
relationships, trade names, patents, and user lists was $73.7 million in fiscal 2020, $33.5 million in fiscal 2019 and $36.6 million in fiscal 2018.

Other intangible assets and related accumulated amortization at January 31 were as follows:

 2020 2019
------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------- ----- ---- ------- - -----
Developed technologies, at cost $ 647.1 $ 670.2
Customer relationships, trade names, patents, and user lists, at cost (1) 532.2 533.1
Other intangible assets, at cost (2) 1,179.3 1,203.3
Less: accumulated amortization (972.2 ) (922.5 )
Other intangible assets, net $ 207.1 $ 280.8

_______________
(1) Included in “Other assets” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(2) Includes the effects of foreign currency translation.

The weighted average amortization period for developed technologies, customer relationships, trade names, patents, and user lists during fiscal 2020 was 5.5 years. Excluding in-process research and development, expected future amortization expense for developed technologies, customer relationships, trade names, patents, and user lists for each of the fiscal years ended thereafter is as follows:

 Fiscal Year ended January 31,
---------- ----------------------------- -----
 2021 $ 64.7
 2022 49.0
 2023 37.6
 2024 19.2
 2025 13.0
Thereafter 23.6
Total $ 207.1

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

At least annually or more frequently as circumstances dictate, Autodesk reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist. Autodesk continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, Autodesk assesses recoverability of these assets. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying amounts of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flow the assets are expected to generate. If the long-lived assets are impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Autodesk did not recognize any material impairments of long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

In addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of its long-lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.
Goodwill

Goodwill consists of the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Autodesk tests goodwill for impairment annually in its fourth fiscal quarter or more often if circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist, or if events have affected the composition of reporting units.

When goodwill is assessed for impairment, Autodesk has the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment (“optional assessment”) prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test. Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors to consider include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic
conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.

The quantitative impairment test is necessary when either Autodesk does not use the optional assessment or, as a result of the optional assessment, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. In situations in which an entity's reporting unit is publicly traded, the fair value of the Company may be approximated by its market capitalization, in performing the quantitative impairment test.

Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value. If impairment exists, the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to fair value through an impairment charge recorded in the Company's statements of operations. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. The value of Autodesk’s goodwill could also be impacted by future adverse changes such as: (i) declines in Autodesk’s actual financial results, (ii) a sustained decline in Autodesk’s market capitalization, (iii) a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the industries Autodesk serves, or (iv) changes in Autodesk’s business strategy.

For the annual impairment test, Autodesk's market capitalization was substantially in excess of the carrying value of the Company as of January 31, 2020. Accordingly, Autodesk has determined there was no goodwill impairment during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. In addition, Autodesk did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses in fiscal 2019 or 2018.

The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020 and 2019:

 January 31, 2020 January 31, 2019
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------- ------- ---------------- ------ - -------
Goodwill, beginning of the year $ 2,600.0 $ 1,769.4
Less: accumulated impairment losses, beginning of the year (149.2 ) (149.2 )
Additions arising from acquisitions during the year — 866.9
Effect of foreign currency translation and measurement period adjustments (1) (5.8 ) (36.3 )
Goodwill, end of the year $ 2,445.0 $ 2,450.8

_______________
(1)
Measurement period adjustments reflect revisions made to the Company's preliminary determination of estimated fair value of assets and liabilities assumed.
Deferred Tax Assets

Deferred tax assets arise primarily from tax credits, net operating losses, and timing differences for reserves, accrued liabilities, stock options, deferred revenue, purchased technologies, and capitalized intangibles, partially offset by U.S. deferred tax liabilities on acquired intangibles, and valuation allowances against U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. Autodesk performed a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believes it will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
Stock-based Compensation Expense

The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as follows:

 Fiscal Year Ended January 31,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - - -----
 2020 2019 2018
Cost of subscription and maintenance revenue $ 13.8 $ 13.2 $ 11.9
Cost of other revenue 5.8 4.3 4.0
Marketing and sales 149.0 109.4 107.3
Research and development 120.8 82.6 82.9
General and administrative 73.0 40.0 55.3
Stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") purchases 362.4 249.5 261.4
Tax benefit (1.1 ) (2.6 ) (2.6 )
Stock-based compensation expense related to stock awards and ESPP purchases, net $ 361.3 $ 246.9 $ 258.8

Autodesk measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award, and recognizes expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Autodesk determines the estimated fair value of stock-based payment awards for stock options and grants of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using either the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model or a binomial-lattice model (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation model). To determine the grant-date fair value of our stock-based payment awards for restricted stock units and performance stock units, we use the quoted stock price on the date of grant, unless the awards are subject to market conditions, in which case we use the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award, and expected dividends. The variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted, as needed. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Autodesk uses the following assumptions to estimate the fair value of stock-based awards:

 Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended
---------------------------------- ---------------------- ----------------- ------------------ ---------------------- ---------- ---------------------- ----------
 January 31, 2020 January 31, 2019 January 31, 2018
 Performance Stock Unit ESPP Stock Option Plans Performance Stock Unit ESPP Performance Stock Unit ESPP
Range of expected volatilities 36% 33 - 40% 37 - 42% 36% 33 - 38% 32% 31 - 34%
Range of expected lives (in years) N/A 0.5 - 2.0 0.5 - 3.8 N/A 0.5 - 2.0 N/A 0.5 - 2.0
Expected dividends —% —% —% —% —% —% —%
Range of risk-free interest rates 2.5% 1.7 - 2.5% 2.3 - 2.7% 2.0% 1.9 - 2.8% 1.0 - 1.2% 0.9 - 1.4%

Autodesk estimates expected volatility for stock-based awards based on the average of the following two measures: (1) a measure of historical volatility in the trading market for the Company’s common stock, and (2) the implied volatility of traded forward call options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock. The expected volatility for performance stock units subject to market conditions includes the expected volatility of companies within the S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.00 billion, depending on the award type.

Autodesk estimates the expected life of stock-based awards using both exercise behavior and post-vesting termination behavior as well as consideration of outstanding options. The range of expected lives of ESPP awards are based upon the four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.

Autodesk did not pay cash dividends in fiscal 2020, 2019, or 2018 and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model.

The risk-free interest rate used in the BSM option pricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock-based awards is the historical yield on U.S. Treasury securities with equivalent remaining lives.

Autodesk recognizes expense only for the stock-based awards that ultimately vest. Autodesk accounts for forfeitures of stock-based awards as those forfeitures occur.
Advertising Expenses

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expenses incurred were $42.2 million in fiscal 2020, $37.5 million in fiscal 2019, and $31.1 million in fiscal 2018.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, excluding stock options and restricted stock. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed based upon the weighted average shares of common shares outstanding for the period and potentially dilutive common shares, including the effect of stock options and restricted stock units under the treasury stock method.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The funded status of Autodesk's defined benefit pension plans is recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation for the fiscal years presented. The projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement based on employee services already rendered and estimated future compensation levels. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of Autodesk's cumulative company and participant contributions made to the various plans in effect.

Net periodic benefit cost is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and includes service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs, and gains or losses previously recognized as a component of other comprehensive loss. Certain events, such as changes in the employee base, plan amendments, and changes in actuarial assumptions may result in a change in the defined benefit obligation and the corresponding change to other comprehensive loss.

Gains and losses and prior service costs not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as they arise are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Those gains and losses and prior service costs are subsequently amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service lives of the plan participants using a corridor approach to determine the portion of gain or loss subject to amortization.

The measurement of projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is based on estimates and assumptions that reflect the terms of the plans and use participant-specific information such as compensation, age and years of services, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return of plan assets, rate of compensation increases, interest rates, and mortality rates.
Accounting Standards in Fiscal 2020

With the exception of those discussed below, there have been no recent changes in accounting pronouncements issued by FASB or adopted by the Company during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, that are applicable to the Company.

Accounting Standards Adopted

Autodesk adopted ASU No. 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities" on February 1, 2019. The amendment helps simplify certain aspects of hedge accounting and results in a more accurate portrayal of the economics of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. For cash flow and net investment hedges as of the adoption date, the guidance required a modified retrospective approach. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only prospectively. The transition impact was immaterial and no substantive changes were made to Autodesk’s current processes, accounting, or disclosures for cash flow hedges.

Autodesk adopted ASU No. 2018-02, “Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” on February 1, 2019. The amendment allows entities the option to reclassify tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") to retained earnings. Upon adoption, the amount reclassified from other comprehensive loss to stockholders' deficit was not material.

Autodesk adopted ASU No. 2019-12 regarding ASC Topic 740, "Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes", which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC Topic 740 on January 31, 2020. The ASU also improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Leases

FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (ASC Topic 842)", to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing transactions. The new standard requires entities to reflect the net present value of all future fixed lease payments for both operating and finance leases on the balance sheet. It also requires entities to disclose fixed and variable lease payments separately and by lease type (operating vs. finance leases). In addition, FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, ASU No. 2018-11and ASU No. 2018-20 to help provide accommodations and interpretive clarifications on various issues raised by stakeholders. ASU No. 2018-10 clarifies ambiguous or potentially conflicting guidance in ASU No. 2016-02. ASU No. 2018-11 provides an additional transition option to apply ASU No. 2016-02 upon adoption of the new standard.

Adoption and policy elections

Autodesk adopted ASU No. 2016-02 as of February 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method permitted under ASU No. 2018-11 for all existing leases which does not include retrospectively adjusting prior periods presented in the financial statements. Under ASU No. 2016-02, as the lessee, Autodesk recognized a right-of-use ("ROU") asset and offsetting lease liability for leases that existed on adoption. The asset and liability were measured at present value of all future fixed lease payments, discounted using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Autodesk has elected to opt for the practical expedients: to not reassess whether any existing contracts are leases or contain a lease; to not reassess the lease classification of existing leases; and to not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases. Autodesk has elected to combine lease and non-lease components for new leases post adoption for all lease assets.

Autodesk determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in “Operating lease right-of-use assets”, “Operating lease liabilities”, and “Long-term operating lease liabilities” in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Operating lease ROU assets represent Autodesk’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Autodesk uses its incremental borrowing rate, if the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, adjusted for local country-specific borrowing rates as applicable, based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made and are reduced by any lease incentives. Options to extend or terminate the lease are considered in determining the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Autodesk has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. Autodesk accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

Quantitative effect of ASC Topic 842 adoption

Under the modified retrospective method, Autodesk recorded $(0.7) million to the opening balance of "Accumulated deficit" as of February 1, 2019. The comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported as under previous accounting guidance. The adoption of ASC Topic 842 did not have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated statement of operations or net cash provided by operating activities as of February 1, 2019.

The following table shows line items that were materially impacted by the adoption of ASC Topic 842 on February 1, 2019 on Autodesk’s Consolidated Balance Sheet:

(1) Adoption of ASC Topic 842 did not have any other material impacts on Autodesk's consolidated financial statements.

See Note 9, "Leases" for disclosures under ASC Topic 842.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards But Not Yet Adopted

In March 2020, FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting", which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. Autodesk is still currently evaluating the impact to the financial statements, the transition, and disclosure requirements of the standard.

In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 regarding ASC Topic 326, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses", which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. Autodesk plans to adopt ASU No. 2016-13 as of the effective date which represents Autodesk’s fiscal year beginning February 1, 2020. The adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

(1) Represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on Autodesk’s closing stock price of $196.85 per share as of January 31, 2020.

As of January 31, 2020, compensation cost of $30.4 million related to non-vested stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.

The following table summarizes information about the pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised and the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:

 Fiscal year ended January 31,

(1) The intrinsic value of options exercised is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the option and the market value of the stock on the date of exercise.

Restricted Stock Units:

A summary of restricted stock activity for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, is as follows:

 Unreleased Restricted Stock Units (in thousands) Weighted average grant date fair value per share
--------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------ - ------------------------------------------------ ------ ------
Unvested restricted stock at January 31, 2019 4,287.4 $ 120.07
Granted 3,136.1 156.24
Vested (2,276.5 ) 112.50
Canceled/Forfeited (422.5 ) 133.82
Performance Adjustment (1) 7.8 142.17
Unvested restricted stock at January 31, 2020 4,732.3 $ 147.24

_______________
(1) Based on Autodesk's financial results and relative total stockholder return for the fiscal 2019 performance period. The performance stock units were attained at rates ranging from 105.2% to 122.5% of the target award.

For the restricted stock granted during fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the weighted average grant date fair values were $156.24, $144.37, and $106.55, respectively. The fair value of the shares vested during fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $361.0 million, $425.4 million, and $399.7 million, respectively.

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, Autodesk granted 2.6 million restricted stock units. Restricted stock units vest over periods ranging from immediately upon grant to a pre-determined date that is typically within three years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units are not considered outstanding stock at the time of grant, as the holders of these units are
not entitled to any of the rights of a stockholder, including voting rights. The fair value of the restricted stock units is expensed ratably over the vesting period.

Additionally, during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, Autodesk granted 0.3 million restricted stock units for which the ultimate number of shares earned is based on the Autodesk closing stock price on each vesting date. As these awards will be settled in a fixed dollar amount of shares, the awards are accounted for as a liability-classified award and are expensed using the straight-line method over the vesting period. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, Autodesk settled liability-classified awards of $23.5 million.

 Autodesk recorded stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units of $274.5 million, $189.3 million, and $202.1 million during fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of January 31, 2020, total compensation cost not yet recognized of $474.6 million related to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. At January 31, 2020, the number of restricted stock units granted but unvested was 4.1 million.

During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, Autodesk granted 0.3 million performance stock units for which the ultimate number of shares earned is determined based on the achievement of performance criteria at the end of the stated service and performance period. The performance criteria for the performance stock units are based on Annualized Recurring Revenue ("ARR") and free cash flow goals adopted by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee, as well as total stockholder return compared against companies in the S&P North American Technology Software Index with a market capitalization over $2.0 billion ("Relative TSR"). These performance stock units vest over a three-year period and have the following vesting schedule:

• Up to one third of the performance stock units may vest following year one, depending upon the achievement of the performance criteria for fiscal 2020 as well as 1-year Relative TSR (covering year one).

• Up to one third of the performance stock units may vest following year two, depending upon the achievement of the performance criteria for year two as well as 2-year Relative TSR (covering years one and two).

• Up to one third of the performance stock units may vest following year three, depending upon the achievement of the performance criteria for year three as well as 3-year Relative TSR (covering years one, two and three).

Performance stock units are not considered outstanding stock at the time of grant, as the holders of these units are not entitled to any of the rights of a stockholder, including voting rights. Autodesk has determined the grant-date fair value for these awards using the stock price on the date of grant or if the awards are subject to a market condition, a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the performance stock units is expensed using the accelerated attribution over the vesting period.

 Autodesk recorded stock-based compensation expense related to performance stock units of $27.1 million, $28.6 million, and $33.7 million during fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively. As of January 31, 2020, total compensation cost not yet recognized of $6.7 million related to unvested performance stock units, is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.7 years. At January 31, 2020, the number of performance stock units granted but unvested was 0.6 million.

1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)

Under Autodesk’s ESPP, which was approved by stockholders in 1998, eligible employees may purchase shares of Autodesk’s common stock at their discretion using up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations, at 85% of the lower of Autodesk's closing price (fair market value) on the offering date or the exercise date. The offering period for ESPP awards consists of four, six-month exercise periods within a 24-month offering period.

At January 31, 2020, a total of 7.3 million shares were available for future issuance. Under the ESPP, the Company issues shares on the first trading day following March 31 and September 30 of each fiscal year. The ESPP does not have an expiration date.

A summary of the ESPP activity for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 is as follows:

 Fiscal year ended January 31,
----------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------- ------ ---- --- ---- ----- --- - -----
 2020 2019 2018
Issued shares 0.9 1.0 2.0
Average price of issued shares $ 102.20 $ 90.25 $ 39.03
Weighted average grant date fair value of awards granted under the ESPP $ 47.78 $ 42.75 $ 32.41

Autodesk recorded $33.3 million, $27.2 million, and $25.7 million of compensation expense associated with the ESPP in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...

['s Level 2 securities and derivatives are valued primarily using observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company has elected to use the income approach to value derivatives using the observable Level 2 market expectations at measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount (discounted). Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient and when required, rates are interpolated from commonly quoted intervals published by market sources. See Note 3, "]:
NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our 70  ADOBE INC.
