ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and the information contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K under the captions “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data,” and “Business.”
This section includes a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Certain prior year information discussed in this section has been recast to conform to the 2019 presentation. However, certain information that was not recast regarding fiscal year 2017 and the related comparison to fiscal year 2018 may be found under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2019.
Overview
We are a leading developer, marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. The brand’s moisture-wicking fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. Our products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. The Under Armour Connected Fitness strategy is focused on engaging with these consumers and increasing awareness and sales of our products.
Our net revenues grew to $5,267.1 million in 2019 from $3,963.3 million in 2015. We believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the Under Armour brand in the marketplace. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on increased sales of our products through ongoing product innovation, investment in our distribution channels and international expansion. While we plan to continue to invest in growth, we also plan to improve efficiencies throughout our business as we seek to gain scale through our operations and return on our investments.
Financial highlights for full year 2019 as compared to the prior year period include:
•Net revenues increased 1%.
•Wholesale revenues increased 1% and direct to consumer revenues were flat.
•Apparel revenue was flat. Footwear revenue increased 2% and accessories revenue decreased 1%.
•Revenue in our North America segment declined 2%. Revenue in our Asia-Pacific, EMEA and Latin America segments grew 14%, 5% and 3%, respectively, with 13% growth in our Connected Fitness segment.
•Gross margin increased 180 basis points.
•Selling, general and administrative expense increased 2%.
A large majority of our products are sold in North America; however, we believe our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. Internationally, our net revenues are generated primarily from a mix of sales to retailers and distributors in our wholesale channel and sales through our direct to consumer channel in Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific.
We believe there is an increasing recognition of the health benefits of an active lifestyle. We believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products. We also believe there is a continuing shift in consumer demand from traditional non-performance products to performance products, which are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin, helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort. We plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets.
Although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth, we also face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities or negatively impact our financial results, including, among others, the risk of general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers. For example, recent and ongoing developments regarding the coronavirus may negatively impact our results of operations. Additionally, we may not be able to successfully execute on our long-term strategies, or successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business effectively. Although we have implemented restructuring plans in the past and may implement additional plans in the future, we

may not fully realize the expected benefits of these plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives. In addition, we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products that meet changing preferences in a timely manner. Furthermore, our industry is very competitive, and competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability. We also rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers outside the U.S. to provide fabrics and to produce our products, and disruptions to our supply chain could harm our business. Our results may also be negatively impacted by the performance of our Japanese licensee. For a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, refer to the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A.
Segment Presentation and Marketing
Effective January 1, 2019, we changed the way we internally analyze the business and now exclude certain corporate costs from our segment profitability measures. We now report these costs within Corporate Other, which is designed to provide increased transparency and comparability of the performance of our operating segments. Prior year amounts have been recast to conform to the 2019 presentation. These changes had no impact on previously reported consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, or cash flows.
Corporate Other consists largely of general and administrative expenses not allocated to an operating segment, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments such as global marketing, global IT, global supply chain, innovation and other corporate support functions; costs related to our global assets and global marketing, costs related to our headquarters; restructuring and restructuring related charges; and certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses.
In connection with the Corporate Other presentation discussed above, effective January 1, 2019, we changed the way we internally analyze marketing. Personnel costs previously included in marketing expense are now included in other expense and digital advertising and placement services previously included in other expense are now included in marketing expense. We believe these changes provide management with increased transparency of our demand creation investments. Certain prior year amounts have been recast to conform to the 2019 presentation. These changes did not have a material impact on marketing amounts.
2020 Restructuring Initiative
In February 2020, we announced that we are currently assessing a potential 2020 restructuring initiative to rebalance our cost base to further improve profitability and cash flow generation. In connection with this initiative, we are considering $325 million to $425 million in estimated pre-tax charges for 2020, including approximately $225 million to $250 million related to the possibility of foregoing opening a flagship store in New York City while pursuing sublet options for the long-term lease. We expect to complete our assessment during the first quarter of 2020, and subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, would announce any potential restructuring charges upon adoption of a restructuring plan.
2017 and 2018 Restructuring Plans
In both 2017 and 2018, our Board of Directors approved restructuring plans (the "2017 restructuring plan" and "2018 restructuring plan") designed to more closely align our financial resources with the critical priorities of our business and optimize operations. We recognized approximately $203.9 million of pre-tax charges in connection with our 2018 restructuring plan and approximately $129.1 million of pre-tax charges in connection with our 2017 restructuring plan, inclusive of $28.6 million of restructuring related goodwill impairment charges for our Connected Fitness business.
The summary of the costs incurred during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, in connection with the 2018 and 2017 restructuring plans, respectively, are as follows:

General
Net revenues comprise net sales, license revenues and Connected Fitness revenues. Net sales comprise sales from our primary product categories, which are apparel, footwear and accessories. Our license revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us from licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on their products. Our Connected Fitness revenues consist of digital advertising and subscriptions from our Connected Fitness business.
Cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs, inbound freight and duty costs, outbound freight costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for inventory obsolescence. The fabrics in many of our products are made primarily of petroleum-based synthetic materials. Therefore our product costs, as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs, could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil. In general, as a percentage of net revenues, we expect cost of goods sold associated with our apparel and accessories to be lower than that of our footwear. A limited portion of cost of goods sold is associated with license and Connected Fitness revenues.
We include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold; however, we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold. Outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate our distribution facilities. These costs were $81.0 million, $91.8 million and $101.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to marketing, selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services. We consolidate our selling, general and administrative expenses into two primary categories: marketing and other. The other category is the sum of our selling, product innovation and supply chain, and corporate services categories. The marketing category consists primarily of sports and brand marketing, media, and retail presentation. Sports and brand marketing includes professional, club, collegiate sponsorship, individual athlete and influencer agreements, and products provided directly to team equipment managers and to individual athletes. Media includes digital, broadcast and print media outlets, including social and mobile media. Retail presentation includes sales displays and concept shops and depreciation expense specific to our in-store fixture programs. Our marketing costs are an important driver of our growth.
Other expense, net consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses on our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and unrealized and realized gains and losses on adjustments that arise from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries.

Consolidated Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net revenues increased $73.9 million, or 1.4%, to $5,267.1 million in 2019 from $5,193.2 million in 2018. Net revenues by product category are summarized below:

------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- --------- -------- --------- -------- - ------- --- -
 Year Ended December 31,
(In thousands) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change
Apparel $ 3,470,285 $ 3,464,120 $ 6,165 0.2 %
Footwear 1,086,551 1,063,175 23,376 2.2
Accessories 416,354 422,496 (6,142) (1.5)
Net Sales 4,973,190 4,949,791 23,399 0.5
License revenues 138,775 124,785 13,990 11.2
Connected Fitness 136,378 120,357 16,021 13.3
Corporate Other (1) 18,789 (1,748) 20,537 1,174.9
Total net revenues $ 5,267,132 $ 5,193,185 $ 73,947 1.4 %

(1) Corporate Other revenues consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within our geographic operating segments, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.

The increase in net sales was driven primarily by unit sales growth in footwear, resulting from strength in our run category. The increase was partially offset by unit sales decline in accessories driven by softer demand.
License revenues increased $14.0 million, or 11.2%, to $138.8 million in 2019 from $124.8 million in 2018, primarily driven by minimum guaranteed royalties and settlements with two of our North America licensing partners.
Connected Fitness revenue increased $16.0 million, or 13.3%, to $136.4 million in 2019 from $120.4 million in 2018 primarily driven by an increase in new subscription revenue and a one-time development fee from a partner. This was partially offset by a decrease in media revenue.
Gross profit increased $130.0 million to $2,470.5 million in 2019 from $2,340.5 million in 2018. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, increased to 46.9% in 2019 compared to 45.1% in 2018. This increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following:
•approximate 90 basis point increase driven by supply chain initiatives related to favorable product costs and lower air freight;
•approximate 50 basis point increase driven by channel mix, primarily due to a lower percentage of off-price sales within our wholesale channel; and
•approximate 40 basis point increase driven by restructuring related charges in the prior year period.
With the exception of improvements in supply chain initiatives related to product cost improvements, we do not expect these trends to have a material impact on the full year 2020.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $51.5 million to $2,233.8 million in 2019 from $2,182.3 million in 2018. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 42.4% in 2019 from 42.0% in 2018. Selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following:
•Marketing costs increased $19.3 million to $579.0 million in 2019 from $559.7 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased marketing investments with the growth of our international business and additional investments in brand marketing campaigns. This was partially offset by lower sports marketing sponsorship expense. As a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs increased to 11.0% in 2019 from 10.8% in 2018.
•Other costs increased $32.2 million to $1,654.8 million in 2019 from $1,622.6 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense, increased process design efficiency consulting expense and increased spend in digital consulting and managed services. As a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 31.4% in 2019 from 31.2% in 2018.
Restructuring and impairment charges related to the 2018 restructuring plan were $183.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no restructuring plan or charges in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income (loss) from operations increased $261.8 million, or 1046.4%, to income of $236.8 million in 2019 from a loss of $25.0 million in 2018. As a percentage of net revenues, Income from operations increased to income

34

Table of Contents
of 4.5% in 2019 from a loss of 0.4% in 2018. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $203.9 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2018 restructuring plan.
Interest expense, net decreased $12.4 million to $21.2 million in 2019 from $33.6 million in 2018. This decrease was due to lower interest expense as a result of the prepayment of the outstanding balance of $136.3 million on our term loan and lower borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
Other expense, net decreased $3.5 million to $5.7 million in 2019 from $9.2 million in 2018. This decrease was due to lower net loss on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies as compared to the prior period, primarily due to increased number of currencies included in our foreign exchange hedging program.
Income tax expense (benefit) increased $90.6 million to an expense of $70.0 million in 2019 from a benefit of $20.6 million in 2018. Our income tax expense (benefit) for 2019, as compared to 2018, was higher primarily due to pre-tax income in 2019 compared to pre-tax losses in 2018, increases in valuation allowances recorded for certain U.S. state jurisdictions, and the one-time benefit in 2018 for an intercompany intangible asset sale. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in valuation allowances recorded for certain foreign jurisdictions in 2019 compared to 2018.
Income (loss) from equity method investment decreased $48.6 million to a loss of $47.7 million in 2019 from income of $0.9 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a $39.0 million impairment of our equity method investment in our Japanese licensee for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017
Net revenues increased $203.9 million, or 4.1%, to $5,193.2 million in 2018 from $4,989.2 million in 2017. Net revenues by product category are summarized below:

Total net revenues $ 5,193,185 $ 4,989,244 $ 203,941 4.1 %

(1) Corporate Other revenues consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within our geographic operating segments, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.
The increase in net sales was driven primarily by:
•Apparel unit sales growth driven by the train category; and
•Footwear unit sales growth, led by the run category.
The increase was partially offset by unit sales decline in accessories.
License revenues increased $8.2 million, or 7.0%, to $124.8 million in 2018 from $116.6 million in 2017.
Connected Fitness revenue increased $18.5 million, or 18.1%, to $120.4 million in 2018 from $101.9 million in 2017 primarily driven by increased subscribers on our fitness applications.
Gross profit increased $89.1 million to $2,340.5 million in 2018 from $2,251.4 million in 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, was unchanged at 45.1% in 2018 compared to 2017. Gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by lower promotional activity, improvements in product cost, lower air freight, higher proportion of international and Connected Fitness revenue and changes in foreign currency; these favorable impacts were offset by channel mix including higher sales to our off-price channel and restructuring related charges.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $82.8 million to $2,182.3 million in 2018 from $2,099.5 million in 2017. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to 42.0% in 2018 from 42.1% in 2017. Selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following:

35

Table of Contents
•Marketing costs decreased $5.5 million to $559.7 million in 2018 from $565.2 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to restructuring efforts, resulting in lower sports marketing sponsorship expense. This decrease was partially offset by higher costs in connection with brand marketing campaigns and increased marketing investments with the growth of our international business. As a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 10.8% in 2018 from 11.3% in 2017.
•Other costs increased $88.3 million to $1,622.6 million in 2018 from $1,534.3 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and higher costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel and international business. As a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 31.2% in 2018 from 30.8% in 2017.
Restructuring and impairment charges increased $59.1 million to $183.1 million from $124.0 million in 2017. Refer to the 2017 and 2018 Restructuring Plans section above for a summary of charges.
Income (loss) from operations decreased $52.8 million, or 189.9%, to a loss of $25.0 million in 2018 from income of $27.8 million in 2017. As a percentage of net revenues, Income from operations decreased to a loss of 0.4% in 2018 from income of 0.5% in 2017. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $203.9 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2018 restructuring plan. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by $129.1 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2017 restructuring plan.
Interest expense, net decreased $0.9 million to $33.6 million in 2018 from $34.5 million in 2017.
Other expense, net increased $5.6 million to $9.2 million in 2018 from $3.6 million in 2017. This increase was due to higher net loss on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies as compared to the prior period.
Income tax expense (benefit) decreased $58.6 million to a benefit of $20.6 million in 2018 from an expense of $38.0 million in 2017. Our effective tax rate was 30.3% in 2018 compared to (368.2)% in 2017. Our effective tax rate for 2018, as compared to 2017, was positively impacted by a one-time tax benefit recorded in 2018 for an intercompany intangible asset sale and the decrease in one-time tax charges due to the Tax Act. These positive impacts were partially offset by the impact of the decrease in the U.S. federal rate applied to U.S. pre-tax losses in 2018.
As of December 31, 2018, we had completed our accounting for the one-time tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act. Our 2018 provision for income taxes included a $1.5 million charge to income tax expense as a result of completing this accounting. This was comprised of $12.0 million of income tax expense related to the transition tax and $(10.5) million of income tax benefit for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets for the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.

Segment Results of Operations
Our operating segments are based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) makes decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. Our segments are defined by geographic regions, including North America, EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. Connected Fitness is also an operating segment.
We exclude certain corporate costs from our segment profitability measures. We reports these costs within Corporate Other, which is designed to provide increased transparency and comparability of our operating segments performance. Corporate Other consists largely of general and administrative expenses not allocated to an operating segment, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments such as global marketing, global IT, global supply chain, innovation and other corporate support functions; costs related to our global assets and global marketing, costs related to our headquarters; restructuring and restructuring related charges; and certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses.
The net revenues and operating income (loss) associated with our segments are summarized in the following tables.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net revenues by segment are summarized below:

Total net revenues $ 5,267,132 $ 5,193,185 $ 73,947 1.4 %

(1) Corporate Other revenues consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within our geographic operating segments, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.
The increase in total net revenues was driven by the following:
•Net revenues in our North America operating segment decreased $76.9 million to $3,658.4 million in 2019 from $3,735.3 million in 2018 primarily due to a unit sales decrease of off-price sales within our wholesale channel and a unit sales decrease in our direct to consumer channel. This was partially offset by favorable impacts of returns activity within our wholesale channel, driven by approximately $33.1 million of specific customer returns that were lower than the reserves previously established.
•Net revenues in our EMEA operating segment increased $30.1 million to $621.1 million in 2019 from $591.1 million in 2018 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale and direct to consumer channels.
•Net revenues in our Asia-Pacific operating segment increased $78.9 million to $636.3 million in 2019 from $557.4 million in 2018 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale and direct to consumer channels.
•Net revenues in our Latin America operating segment increased $5.3 million to $196.1 million in 2019 from $190.8 million in 2018 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale channel, partially offset by a decrease due to a change in our business model in Brazil from a subsidiary to a license and distributor model.
•Net revenues in our Connected Fitness operating segment increased $16.0 million to $136.4 million in 2019 from $120.4 million in 2018 primarily driven by an increase in new subscription revenue and a one-time development fee from a partner. This was partially offset by a decrease in media revenue.

The increase in total operating income was driven by the following:
Operating segments
•Operating income in our North America operating segment increased $15.2 million to $733.4 million in 2019 from $718.2 million in 2018 primarily due to gross margin benefits based on a lower percentage of off-price sales within our wholesale channel and lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by decreases in net revenues discussed above.
•Operating income in our EMEA operating segment increased $23.4 million to $53.7 million in 2019 from$30.4 million in 2018 primarily due to increases in net revenues discussed above.
•Operating income in our Asia-Pacific operating segment decreased $5.9 million to $97.6 million in 2019 from $103.5 million in 2018 primarily due to higher compensation expense and marketing investments. This decrease was partially offset by increases in net revenues discussed above.
•Operating loss in our Latin America operating segment decreased $13.7 million to $3.2 million in 2019 from $16.9 million in 2018 primarily due to changes to our business model in Brazil.
•Operating income in our Connected Fitness segment increased $11.2 million to $17.1 million in 2019 from$5.9 million in 2018 primarily driven by increases in net revenue discussed above.
Non-operating segment
•Operating loss in our Corporate Other non-operating segment decreased $204.2 million to $662.0 million in 2019 from $866.2 million in 2018 primarily due to $203.9 million of 2018 restructuring plan charges for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no restructuring plan or charges in the year ended December 31, 2019.

The increase in total net revenues was driven by the following:
•Net revenues in our North America operating segment decreased $65.8 million to $3,735.3 million in 2018 from $3,801.1 million in 2017 primarily due to lower sales driven by lower demand, partially offset by increased off-price sales, in each case within our wholesale channel.
•Net revenues in our EMEA operating segment increased $119.5 million to $591.1 million in 2018 from $471.6 million in 2017 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale channel in the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain.
•Net revenues in our Asia-Pacific operating segment increased $126.5 million to $557.4 million in 2018 from $431.0 million in 2017 primarily due to unit sales growth in our direct to consumer channel and our wholesale channel in China.
•Net revenues in our Latin America operating segment increased $9.5 million to $190.8 million in 2018 from $181.3 million in 2017 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale channel in Mexico and Chile, partially offset by a decrease in unit sales due a change in our business model in Brazil from a subsidiary to a license and distributor model.
•Net revenues in our Connected Fitness operating segment increased $18.5 million to $120.4 million in 2018 from $101.9 million in 2017 primarily driven by additional subscription revenue on our fitness applications.

The decrease in total operating income was driven by the following:
Operating segments
•Operating income in our North America operating segment increased $18.0 million to $718.2 million in 2018 from $700.2 million in 2017 primarily due to decreased marketing and selling costs.
•Operating income in our EMEA operating segment increased $4.3 million to $30.4 million in 2018 from $26.0 million in 2017 primarily due to the increase in net sales discussed above, partially offset by a reserve related to a commercial dispute and increased marketing.
•Operating income in our Asia-Pacific operating segment increased $14.2 million to $103.5 million in 2018 from $89.3 million in 2017 primarily due to sales growth discussed above. This increase was partially offset by higher investments in our direct to consumer business.
•Operating loss in our Latin America operating segment increased $2.5 million to $16.9 million in 2018 from $14.4 million in 2017 primarily due to lower gross margin based on a higher percentage of off-price and independent distributor sales within our wholesale channel.
•Operating loss in our Connected Fitness segment decreased $12.5 million to income of $5.9 million in 2018 from a loss of $6.5 million in 2017 primarily driven by increased sales growth discussed above.
Non-operating segment
•Operating loss in our Corporate Other non-operating segment increased $99.4 million to $866.2 million in 2018 from $766.8 million in 2017 primarily due to a $74.8 million increase in the 2018 restructuring plan charges of $203.9 million, compared to the 2017 restructuring plan charges of $129.1 million.

Seasonality
Historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the calendar year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products

Table of Contents
during the fall selling season, including a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. The level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. We generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season.
The following table sets forth certain financial information for the periods indicated. The data is prepared on the same basis as the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. All recurring, necessary adjustments are reflected in the data below:

Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity
Our cash requirements have principally been for working capital and capital expenditures. We fund our working capital, primarily inventory, and capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, borrowings available under our credit and long term debt facilities and the issuance of debt securities. Our working capital requirements generally reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize the majority of our net revenues in the back half of the year. Our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture and branded concept shop program, improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth, leasehold improvements to our brand and factory house stores, and investment and improvements in information technology systems.
Our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. These systems and processes, including our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. In addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels.
We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, borrowings available to us under our credit agreement and other financing instruments and our ability to access the capital markets are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, an economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity (refer to the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A). In addition, instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business on terms acceptable to us or at all.
At December 31, 2019, $165.4 million, or approximately 21.0%, of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations, we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the United States. In addition, our United States operations do not require the

40

Table of Contents
repatriation of these funds to meet our currently projected liquidity needs. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States.
The Tax Act imposed U.S. federal tax on all post-1986 foreign unrepatriated earnings accumulated through December 31, 2017. The portion of these earnings not subject to U.S. federal income tax as part of the one-time transition tax should, in general, not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. We will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings, as well as future earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, to fund international growth and operations. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would still be required to accrue and pay certain taxes upon repatriation, including foreign withholding taxes and certain U.S. state taxes and record foreign exchange rate impacts. Determination of the unrecorded deferred tax liability that would be incurred if such amounts were repatriated is not practicable.

Cash Flows
The following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented:

------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ------- ---- --------- ---- ------- --------- - -------
 Year Ended December 31,
(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 509,031 $ 628,230 $ 237,460
Investing activities (147,113) (202,904) (282,987)
Financing activities (137,070) (189,868) 106,759
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 5,100 12,467 4,178
Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 229,948 $ 247,925 $ 65,410

Operating Activities
Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, losses on disposals of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and changes in reserves and allowances. In addition, operating cash flows include the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally inventories, accounts receivable, income taxes payable and receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $119.2 million to $509.0 million in 2019 from $628.2 million in 2018. The decrease was due to decreased net cash inflows from operating assets and liabilities of $360.2 million. The decrease in cash inflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by the following:
•a decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable of $232.3 million in 2019 as compared to 2018;
•a decrease in changes in reserves and allowances and customer refund liabilities of $176.9 million in 2019 as compared to 2018; and
•a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $153.6 million in 2019 as compared to 2018.
This was partially offset by an increase in cash provided by changes in prepaid expenses and other assets of $132.2 million and an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $241.0 million year over year.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities decreased $55.8 million to $147.1 million in 2019 from $202.9 million in 2018, primarily due to lower capital expenditures and the purchase of an additional 10% common stock ownership in Dome Corporation ("Dome"), our Japanese licensee in 2018.
Total capital expenditures were $144.3 million and $154.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capital expenditures for 2020 are expected to be approximately $165.0 million.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities decreased $52.8 million to $137.1 million in 2019 from $189.9 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower borrowings and net repayments on our credit facility in 2019 compared to 2018.

Credit Facility
On March 8, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, amending and restating our prior credit agreement. As amended and restated, our credit agreement has a term of five years, maturing in March 2024, and provides revolving credit commitments for up to $1.25 billion of borrowings, with no term loan borrowings, which were provided for under our prior credit agreement. As of December 31, 2019, there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $136.3 million outstanding under our prior term loan.
At our request and the lender's consent, revolving and or term loan borrowings may be increased by up to $300.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement, as amended. Incremental borrowings are uncommitted and the availability thereof will depend on market conditions at the time we seek to incur such borrowings.
The borrowings under the revolving credit facility have maturities of less than one year. Up to $50.0 million of the facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. There were $5.0 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2019.
The credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions, limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge our assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. We are also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.50 to 1.00 and we are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 ("consolidated leverage ratio"). As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with these ratios. In addition, the credit agreement contains events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, and includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other material indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement.
Borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) an alternate base rate, or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made (“adjusted LIBOR”), plus in each case an applicable margin. The applicable margin for loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the “Pricing Grid”) based on the consolidated leverage ratio and ranges between 1.00% to 1.25% for adjusted LIBOR loans and 0.00% to 0.25% for alternate base rate loans. The weighted average interest rate under the outstanding term loans was 3.2% during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings under the outstanding term loan. The weighted average interest rate under the revolving credit facility borrowings was 3.6% and 3.0% during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility and certain fees with respect to letters of credit. As of December 31, 2019, the commitment fee was 15 basis points. Since inception, we incurred and deferred $3.4 million in financing costs in connection with the credit agreement.

3.250% Senior Notes
In June 2016, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2026 (the “Notes”). The proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 beginning December 15, 2016. Prior to March 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), we may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or a “make-whole” amount applicable to such Notes as described in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after March 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), we may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants, including limitations that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to create or incur secured indebtedness and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our properties or assets to another person, in each case subject to material exceptions described in the indenture. We incurred and deferred $5.3 million in financing costs in connection with the Notes.

Other Long Term Debt
In December 2012, we entered into a $50.0 million recourse loan collateralized by the land, buildings and tenant improvements comprising our corporate headquarters. In July 2018, this loan was repaid in full, without penalties, using borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Interest expense, net was $21.2 million, $33.6 million, and $34.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, bank fees, capital and built-to-suit lease interest and interest expense under the credit and other long term debt facilities. Amortization of deferred financing costs was $2.4 million, $1.5 million, and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We monitor the financial health and stability of our lenders under the credit and other long term debt facilities, however during any period of significant instability in the credit markets lenders could be negatively impacted in their ability to perform under these facilities.

Contractual Commitments and Contingencies
We lease warehouse space, office facilities, space for our brand and factory house stores and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The leases expire at various dates through 2035, excluding extensions at our option, and include provisions for rental adjustments. In addition, this table includes executed lease agreements for brand and factory house stores that we did not yet occupy as of December 31, 2019. The operating leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time. Our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 as well as significant agreements entered into during the period after December 31, 2019 through the date of this report are summarized in the following table:

(1)   Includes estimated interest payments based on applicable fixed and currently effective floating interest rates as of December 31, 2019, timing of scheduled payments, and the term of the debt obligations.
(2)   Includes the minimum payments for lease obligations. The lease obligations do not include any contingent rent expense we may incur at our brand and factory house stores based on future sales above a specified minimum or payments made for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. Contingent rent expense was $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In February 2020, we announced that we are considering foregoing opening a flagship store in New York City while pursuing sublet options for the long-term lease. The amounts included above reflect our existing contractual obligations with respect to that lease, which totaled $506.2 million as of December 31, 2019.
(3)   We generally place orders with our manufacturers at least three to four months in advance of expected future sales. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations primarily represent our open production purchase orders with our manufacturers for our apparel, footwear and accessories, including expected inbound freight, duties and other costs. These open purchase orders specify fixed or minimum quantities of products at determinable prices. The product purchase obligations also includes fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2019.
(4)   Includes sponsorships with professional teams, professional leagues, colleges and universities, individual athletes, athletic events and other marketing commitments in order to promote our brand. Some of these sponsorship agreements provide for additional performance incentives and product supply obligations. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products. The amount of product

43

Table of Contents
provided to these sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, it is not possible to determine the performance incentive amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are primarily subject to certain performance based and other variables. The amounts listed above are the fixed minimum amounts required to be paid under these sponsorship agreements. Additionally, these amounts include minimum guaranteed royalty payments to endorsers and licensors based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products.
(5)  Represents the future cash payments due related to the Tax Act enacted in 2017 as part of the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
The table above excludes a liability of $37.2 million for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our uncertain tax positions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In connection with various contracts and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items. Generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent, engage in willful misconduct, or act in bad faith. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements. We consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts.
There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2019. The following description of our critical accounting policies largely summarize generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and are meant to provide clarity regarding our existing application of these policies.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 606 ("ASC 606"). Net revenues consist of net sales of apparel, footwear and accessories, license and Connected Fitness revenue. We recognize revenue when we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to our customers, which occurs either at a point in time or over time, depending on when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. The amount of revenue recognized considers terms of sale that create variability in the amount of consideration that we ultimately expect to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services and is subject to an overall constraint that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Sales taxes imposed on our revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis within the consolidated statements of operations, and therefore do not impact net revenues or costs of goods sold.
Revenue transactions associated with the sale of apparel, footwear, and accessories, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. We satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. In our wholesale channel, transfer of control is based upon shipment under free on board shipping point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the

Table of Contents
country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. We may also ship product directly from our supplier to wholesale customers and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. In our direct to consumer channel, transfer of control takes place at the point of sale for brand and factory house customers and upon shipment to substantially all e-commerce customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions are established in accordance with local and industry practices. Payment is generally required within 30 to 60 days of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer in the United States, and generally within 60 to 90 days of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer internationally. Payment is generally due at the time of sale for direct to consumer transactions.
Gift cards issued to customers by us are recorded as contract liabilities until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized. We also estimate and recognize revenue for gift card balances not expected to ever be redeemed ("breakage") to the extent that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. Such estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual customer redemptions.
Revenue from our licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to our trademarks and benefit from such access through their sales of licensed products. These arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements may be subject to a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Payments are generally due quarterly. We recognize revenue for sales-based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount) as licensed products are sold by the licensee. If a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is recognized as revenue over the contractual period. This sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best represents the value transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that we are entitled to receive in exchange for providing access to our trademarks.
Revenue from Connected Fitness subscriptions is recognized on a gross basis and is recognized over the term of the subscription. We receive payments in advance of revenue recognition for subscriptions and these payments are recorded as contract liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Related commission cost is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Revenue from Connected Fitness digital advertising is recognized as we satisfy performance obligations pursuant to customer insertion orders.
We record reductions to revenue at the time of the transaction for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. We base these estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which are inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates. If we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established, we would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination. Provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers. Reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts are included within customer refund liability and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were $219.4 million and $301.4 million, respectively, in reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts within customer refund liability and $61.1 million and $113.9 million, respectively, as the estimated value of inventory associated with the reserves for sales returns within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of revenue recognition.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgment about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from estimates. If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determine a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a benefit or charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the

45

Table of Contents
period in which such a determination was made. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $15.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively.
Inventory Valuation and Reserves
Inventories consist primarily of finished goods. Costs of finished goods inventories include all costs incurred to bring inventory to its current condition, including inbound freight, duties and other costs. We value our inventory at standard cost which approximates landed cost, using the first-in, first-out method of cost determination. Net realizable value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. If we determine that the estimated net realizable value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those that we projected, further adjustments may be required that would increase the cost of goods sold in the period in which such a determination was made.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and are allocated to the reporting units that are expected to receive the related benefits. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In conducting an annual impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that is the case, we perform the goodwill impairment test. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. We estimate fair value using the discounted cash flows model, under the income approach, which indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital, long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business, and working capital effects. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is impaired to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. We perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year.
As of our annual impairment test, in the fourth quarter of 2019, no impairment of goodwill was identified. The fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of our Latin America reporting unit. The fair value of the Latin America reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 19%. Holding all other assumptions used in the fair value measurement of the Latin America reporting unit constant, a reduction in the growth rate of revenue by 2.25 percentage points or a reduction in the growth rate of net income by 3.5 percentage points would eliminate the headroom. No events occurred during the period ended December 31, 2019 that indicated it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of goodwill.
We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. These factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash flows. When factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we review long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. If future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment is recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value.
Equity Method Investment
In April 2018, we invested ¥4.2 billion or $39.2 million in exchange for an additional 10% common stock ownership in Dome Corporation ("Dome"), our Japanese licensee. This additional investment brought our total investment in Dome's common stock to 29.5%, from 19.5%. We account for our investment in Dome under the equity method, given that we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over Dome. Investments under the equity method are required to be considered for impairment when events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If a qualitative assessment indicates that our investment in Dome may be impaired, a quantitative assessment is performed. If the quantitative assessment indicates a decline in value that is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge would be recognized.
In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment of potential impairment indicators for our investment in Dome and determined that indicators of impairment exist. While there was no single event or factor, we considered Dome's future rate of

46

Table of Contents
growth and profitability and strategic objectives. We performed a valuation of our investment in Dome and determined that the fair value of our investment is less than its carrying value by $39.0 million. We determined this decline in value to be other-than-temporary considering the extent to which the market value of our investment is less than the carrying value, the amount of Dome's indebtedness maturing within a short-term period, and Dome's long-term financial forecast. As a result, we recorded a $39.0 million impairment of our equity method investment in Dome in the fourth quarter of 2019, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The impairment charge was recorded within income (loss) from equity method investment on the consolidated statements of operations and as a reduction to the invested balance within other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. We calculate fair value using the discounted cash flows model, which indicates the fair value of the investment based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the investment to generate in the future.
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded the allocable share of Dome’s net loss of $8.7 million and net income of $1.0 million, respectively, within income (loss) from equity method investment on the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the invested balance within other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of our total investment in Dome was $5.1 million and $52.8 million, respectively.
In addition to the investment in Dome, we have a license agreement with Dome. We recorded license revenues from Dome of $37.8 million and $35.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we have $15.6 million and $13.1 million in licensing receivables outstanding, recorded in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line item within our consolidated balance sheet. To the extent Dome continues to experience challenges in the performance of their business, we may not continue to realize the licensing revenues received from them in line with their past results.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary. We made the policy election to record any liability associated with Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) in the period in which it was incurred.
Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. We consider all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made.
A significant portion of our deferred tax assets relate to U.S. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. Realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future U.S. pre-tax earnings. In evaluating the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019, we considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to the following:
Positive
•2019 pre-tax income plus tax permanent differences and taxable income in the U.S. federal and certain state jurisdictions;
•Three year cumulative pre-tax income plus tax permanent differences in the U.S. federal jurisdiction;
•Forecasted future pre-tax income plus tax permanent differences in the U.S. federal and certain state jurisdictions;
•No history of U.S. federal and state tax attributes expiring unused;
•Restructuring plans undertaken in 2017, 2018, and being assessed for 2020, which aim to improve future profitability;
•Available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies may exist;
•Reversal of deferred tax liabilities and timing thereof.

Negative
•Three year cumulative pre-tax losses plus tax permanent differences in certain state jurisdictions;
•Forecasted year over year U.S. revenue declines in 2020 which decrease profitability in the U.S. federal and certain state jurisdictions;

47

Table of Contents
•Restructuring plans undertaken in 2017, 2018, and being assessed for 2020, which result in significant one-time charges, which reduce profitability in the U.S. federal and certain state jurisdictions;
•Inherent challenges in forecasting future pre-tax earnings which rely, in part, on improved profitability from our restructuring efforts;
•The continued challenges in the U.S. consumer retail business environment.

As of December 31, 2019, we believe that the weight of the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence regarding the realization of our U.S. federal deferred tax assets. However, as of December 31, 2019, we believe the weight of the negative evidence outweighs the positive evidence regarding the realization of the majority of the state deferred tax assets and have recorded a valuation allowance against these assets. We will continue to evaluate our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.
Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.
Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, we had $90.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.43 years. This unrecognized compensation expense does not include any expense related to performance-based restricted stock units and stock options for which the performance targets have not been deemed probable as of December 31, 2019.
The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards represent management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. In addition, compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance targets is deemed probable, which requires management judgment. Refer to Note 2 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on stock-based compensation.

General
Net revenues comprise net sales, license revenues and Connected Fitness revenues. Net sales comprise sales from our primary product categories, which are apparel, footwear and accessories. Our license revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us from licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on their products. Our Connected Fitness revenues consist of digital advertising and subscriptions from our Connected Fitness business.
Cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs, inbound freight and duty costs, outbound freight costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for inventory obsolescence. The fabrics in many of our products are made primarily of petroleum-based synthetic materials. Therefore our product costs, as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs, could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil. In general, as a percentage of net revenues, we expect cost of goods sold associated with our apparel and accessories to be lower than that of our footwear. A limited portion of cost of goods sold is associated with license and Connected Fitness revenues.
We include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold; however, we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold. Outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate our distribution facilities. These costs were $81.0 million, $91.8 million and $101.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to marketing, selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services. We consolidate our selling, general and administrative expenses into two primary categories: marketing and other. The other category is the sum of our selling, product innovation and supply chain, and corporate services categories. The marketing category consists primarily of sports and brand marketing, media, and retail presentation.

Consolidated Results of Operations
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net revenues increased $73.9 million, or 1.4%, to $5,267.1 million in 2019 from $5,193.2 million in 2018. Net revenues by product category are summarized below:

------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- --------- -------- --------- -------- - ------- --- -
 Year Ended December 31,
(In thousands) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change
Apparel $ 3,470,285 $ 3,464,120 $ 6,165 0.2 %
Footwear 1,086,551 1,063,175 23,376 2.2
Accessories 416,354 422,496 (6,142) (1.5)
Net Sales 4,973,190 4,949,791 23,399 0.5
License revenues 138,775 124,785 13,990 11.2
Connected Fitness 136,378 120,357 16,021 13.3
Corporate Other (1) 18,789 (1,748) 20,537 1,174.9
Total net revenues $ 5,267,132 $ 5,193,185 $ 73,947 1.4 %

(1) Corporate Other revenues consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within our geographic operating segments, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.

The increase in net sales was driven primarily by unit sales growth in footwear, resulting from strength in our run category. The increase was partially offset by unit sales decline in accessories driven by softer demand.
License revenues increased $14.0 million, or 11.2%, to $138.8 million in 2019 from $124.8 million in 2018, primarily driven by minimum guaranteed royalties and settlements with two of our North America licensing partners.
Connected Fitness revenue increased $16.0 million, or 13.3%, to $136.4 million in 2019 from $120.4 million in 2018 primarily driven by an increase in new subscription revenue and a one-time development fee from a partner. This was partially offset by a decrease in media revenue.
Gross profit increased $130.0 million to $2,470.5 million in 2019 from $2,340.5 million in 2018. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, increased to 46.9% in 2019 compared to 45.1% in 2018. This increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following:
•approximate 90 basis point increase driven by supply chain initiatives related to favorable product costs and lower air freight;
•approximate 50 basis point increase driven by channel mix, primarily due to a lower percentage of off-price sales within our wholesale channel; and
•approximate 40 basis point increase driven by restructuring related charges in the prior year period.
With the exception of improvements in supply chain initiatives related to product cost improvements, we do not expect these trends to have a material impact on the full year 2020.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $51.5 million to $2,233.8 million in 2019 from $2,182.3 million in 2018. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 42.4% in 2019 from 42.0% in 2018. Selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following:
•Marketing costs increased $19.3 million to $579.0 million in 2019 from $559.7 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased marketing investments with the growth of our international business and additional investments in brand marketing campaigns. This was partially offset by lower sports marketing sponsorship expense. As a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs increased to 11.0% in 2019 from 10.8% in 2018.
•Other costs increased $32.2 million to $1,654.8 million in 2019 from $1,622.6 million in 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense, increased process design efficiency consulting expense and increased spend in digital consulting and managed services. As a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 31.4% in 2019 from 31.2% in 2018.
Restructuring and impairment charges related to the 2018 restructuring plan were $183.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no restructuring plan or charges in the year ended December 31, 2019.
Income (loss) from operations increased $261.8 million, or 1046.4%, to income of $236.8 million in 2019 from a loss of $25.0 million in 2018. As a percentage of net revenues, Income from operations increased to income

Table of Contents
of 4.5% in 2019 from a loss of 0.4% in 2018. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $203.9 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2018 restructuring plan.
Interest expense, net decreased $12.4 million to $21.2 million in 2019 from $33.6 million in 2018. This decrease was due to lower interest expense as a result of the prepayment of the outstanding balance of $136.3 million on our term loan and lower borrowings on our revolving credit facility.
Other expense, net decreased $3.5 million to $5.7 million in 2019 from $9.2 million in 2018. This decrease was due to lower net loss on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies as compared to the prior period, primarily due to increased number of currencies included in our foreign exchange hedging program.
Income tax expense (benefit) increased $90.6 million to an expense of $70.0 million in 2019 from a benefit of $20.6 million in 2018. Our income tax expense (benefit) for 2019, as compared to 2018, was higher primarily due to pre-tax income in 2019 compared to pre-tax losses in 2018, increases in valuation allowances recorded for certain U.S. state jurisdictions, and the one-time benefit in 2018 for an intercompany intangible asset sale. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in valuation allowances recorded for certain foreign jurisdictions in 2019 compared to 2018.
Income (loss) from equity method investment decreased $48.6 million to a loss of $47.7 million in 2019 from income of $0.9 million in 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a $39.0 million impairment of our equity method investment in our Japanese licensee for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017
Net revenues increased $203.9 million, or 4.1%, to $5,193.2 million in 2018 from $4,989.2 million in 2017. Net revenues by product category are summarized below:

Total net revenues $ 5,193,185 $ 4,989,244 $ 203,941 4.1 %

(1) Corporate Other revenues consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within our geographic operating segments, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.
The increase in net sales was driven primarily by:
•Apparel unit sales growth driven by the train category; and
•Footwear unit sales growth, led by the run category.
The increase was partially offset by unit sales decline in accessories.
License revenues increased $8.2 million, or 7.0%, to $124.8 million in 2018 from $116.6 million in 2017.
Connected Fitness revenue increased $18.5 million, or 18.1%, to $120.4 million in 2018 from $101.9 million in 2017 primarily driven by increased subscribers on our fitness applications.
Gross profit increased $89.1 million to $2,340.5 million in 2018 from $2,251.4 million in 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, was unchanged at 45.1% in 2018 compared to 2017. Gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by lower promotional activity, improvements in product cost, lower air freight, higher proportion of international and Connected Fitness revenue and changes in foreign currency; these favorable impacts were offset by channel mix including higher sales to our off-price channel and restructuring related charges.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $82.8 million to $2,182.3 million in 2018 from $2,099.5 million in 2017. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to 42.0% in 2018 from 42.1% in 2017. Selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following:

35

Table of Contents
•Marketing costs decreased $5.5 million to $559.7 million in 2018 from $565.2 million in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to restructuring efforts, resulting in lower sports marketing sponsorship expense. This decrease was partially offset by higher costs in connection with brand marketing campaigns and increased marketing investments with the growth of our international business. As a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 10.8% in 2018 from 11.3% in 2017.
•Other costs increased $88.3 million to $1,622.6 million in 2018 from $1,534.3 million in 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and higher costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel and international business. As a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 31.2% in 2018 from 30.8% in 2017.
Restructuring and impairment charges increased $59.1 million to $183.1 million from $124.0 million in 2017. Refer to the 2017 and 2018 Restructuring Plans section above for a summary of charges.
Income (loss) from operations decreased $52.8 million, or 189.9%, to a loss of $25.0 million in 2018 from income of $27.8 million in 2017. As a percentage of net revenues, Income from operations decreased to a loss of 0.4% in 2018 from income of 0.5% in 2017. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $203.9 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2018 restructuring plan. Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by $129.1 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2017 restructuring plan.
Interest expense, net decreased $0.9 million to $33.6 million in 2018 from $34.5 million in 2017.
Other expense, net increased $5.6 million to $9.2 million in 2018 from $3.6 million in 2017. This increase was due to higher net loss on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies as compared to the prior period.
Income tax expense (benefit) decreased $58.6 million to a benefit of $20.6 million in 2018 from an expense of $38.0 million in 2017. Our effective tax rate was 30.3% in 2018 compared to (368.2)% in 2017. Our effective tax rate for 2018, as compared to 2017, was positively impacted by a one-time tax benefit recorded in 2018 for an intercompany intangible asset sale and the decrease in one-time tax charges due to the Tax Act. These positive impacts were partially offset by the impact of the decrease in the U.S. federal rate applied to U.S. pre-tax losses in 2018.
As of December 31, 2018, we had completed our accounting for the one-time tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act. Our 2018 provision for income taxes included a $1.5 million charge to income tax expense as a result of completing this accounting. This was comprised of $12.0 million of income tax expense related to the transition tax and $(10.5) million of income tax benefit for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets for the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.

Segment Results of Operations
Our operating segments are based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) makes decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. Our segments are defined by geographic regions, including North America, EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. Connected Fitness is also an operating segment.
We exclude certain corporate costs from our segment profitability measures. We reports these costs within Corporate Other, which is designed to provide increased transparency and comparability of our operating segments performance. Corporate Other consists largely of general and administrative expenses not allocated to an operating segment, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments such as global marketing, global IT, global supply chain, innovation and other corporate support functions; costs related to our global assets and global marketing, costs related to our headquarters; restructuring and restructuring related charges; and certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses.
The net revenues and operating income (loss) associated with our segments are summarized in the following tables.

(1) Corporate Other revenues consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within our geographic operating segments, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.
The increase in total net revenues was driven by the following:
•Net revenues in our North America operating segment decreased $76.9 million to $3,658.4 million in 2019 from $3,735.3 million in 2018 primarily due to a unit sales decrease of off-price sales within our wholesale channel and a unit sales decrease in our direct to consumer channel. This was partially offset by favorable impacts of returns activity within our wholesale channel, driven by approximately $33.1 million of specific customer returns that were lower than the reserves previously established.
•Net revenues in our EMEA operating segment increased $30.1 million to $621.1 million in 2019 from $591.1 million in 2018 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale and direct to consumer channels.
•Net revenues in our Asia-Pacific operating segment increased $78.9 million to $636.3 million in 2019 from $557.4 million in 2018 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale and direct to consumer channels.
•Net revenues in our Latin America operating segment increased $5.3 million to $196.1 million in 2019 from $190.8 million in 2018 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale channel, partially offset by a decrease due to a change in our business model in Brazil from a subsidiary to a license and distributor model.
•Net revenues in our Connected Fitness operating segment increased $16.0 million to $136.4 million in 2019 from $120.4 million in 2018 primarily driven by an increase in new subscription revenue and a one-time development fee from a partner. This was partially offset by a decrease in media revenue.

The increase in total net revenues was driven by the following:
•Net revenues in our North America operating segment decreased $65.8 million to $3,735.3 million in 2018 from $3,801.1 million in 2017 primarily due to lower sales driven by lower demand, partially offset by increased off-price sales, in each case within our wholesale channel.
•Net revenues in our EMEA operating segment increased $119.5 million to $591.1 million in 2018 from $471.6 million in 2017 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale channel in the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain.
•Net revenues in our Asia-Pacific operating segment increased $126.5 million to $557.4 million in 2018 from $431.0 million in 2017 primarily due to unit sales growth in our direct to consumer channel and our wholesale channel in China.
•Net revenues in our Latin America operating segment increased $9.5 million to $190.8 million in 2018 from $181.3 million in 2017 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale channel in Mexico and Chile, partially offset by a decrease in unit sales due a change in our business model in Brazil from a subsidiary to a license and distributor model.
•Net revenues in our Connected Fitness operating segment increased $18.5 million to $120.4 million in 2018 from $101.9 million in 2017 primarily driven by additional subscription revenue on our fitness applications.

Total operating income (loss) $ (25,017) $ 27,843 $ (52,860) (189.9) %

The decrease in total operating income was driven by the following:
Operating segments
•Operating income in our North America operating segment increased $18.0 million to $718.2 million in 2018 from $700.2 million in 2017 primarily due to decreased marketing and selling costs.
•Operating income in our EMEA operating segment increased $4.3 million to $30.4 million in 2018 from $26.0 million in 2017 primarily due to the increase in net sales discussed above, partially offset by a reserve related to a commercial dispute and increased marketing.
•Operating income in our Asia-Pacific operating segment increased $14.2 million to $103.5 million in 2018 from $89.3 million in 2017 primarily due to sales growth discussed above. This increase was partially offset by higher investments in our direct to consumer business.
•Operating loss in our Latin America operating segment increased $2.5 million to $16.9 million in 2018 from $14.4 million in 2017 primarily due to lower gross margin based on a higher percentage of off-price and independent distributor sales within our wholesale channel.
•Operating loss in our Connected Fitness segment decreased $12.5 million to income of $5.9 million in 2018 from a loss of $6.5 million in 2017 primarily driven by increased sales growth discussed above.
Non-operating segment
•Operating loss in our Corporate Other non-operating segment increased $99.4 million to $866.2 million in 2018 from $766.8 million in 2017 primarily due to a $74.8 million increase in the 2018 restructuring plan charges of $203.9 million, compared to the 2017 restructuring plan charges of $129.1 million.

Seasonality
Historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the calendar year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products

Table of Contents
during the fall selling season, including a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. The level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. We generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season.

Financial Position, Capital Resources and Liquidity
Our cash requirements have principally been for working capital and capital expenditures. We fund our working capital, primarily inventory, and capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, borrowings available under our credit and long term debt facilities and the issuance of debt securities. Our working capital requirements generally reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize the majority of our net revenues in the back half of the year. Our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture and branded concept shop program, improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth, leasehold improvements to our brand and factory house stores, and investment and improvements in information technology systems.
Our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. These systems and processes, including our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. In addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels.
We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, borrowings available to us under our credit agreement and other financing instruments and our ability to access the capital markets are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, an economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity (refer to the “Risk Factors” section included in Item 1A). In addition, instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business on terms acceptable to us or at all.
At December 31, 2019, $165.4 million, or approximately 21.0%, of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations, we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the United States. In addition, our United States operations do not require the

40

Table of Contents
repatriation of these funds to meet our currently projected liquidity needs. Should we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States.
The Tax Act imposed U.S. federal tax on all post-1986 foreign unrepatriated earnings accumulated through December 31, 2017. The portion of these earnings not subject to U.S. federal income tax as part of the one-time transition tax should, in general, not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. We will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings, as well as future earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, to fund international growth and operations. If we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would still be required to accrue and pay certain taxes upon repatriation, including foreign withholding taxes and certain U.S. state taxes and record foreign exchange rate impacts. Determination of the unrecorded deferred tax liability that would be incurred if such amounts were repatriated is not practicable.

Cash Flows
The following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented:

------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ------- ---- --------- ---- ------- --------- - -------
 Year Ended December 31,
(In thousands) 2019 2018 2017
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 509,031 $ 628,230 $ 237,460
Investing activities (147,113) (202,904) (282,987)
Financing activities (137,070) (189,868) 106,759
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 5,100 12,467 4,178
Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 229,948 $ 247,925 $ 65,410

Operating Activities
Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, losses on disposals of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and changes in reserves and allowances. In addition, operating cash flows include the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally inventories, accounts receivable, income taxes payable and receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $119.2 million to $509.0 million in 2019 from $628.2 million in 2018. The decrease was due to decreased net cash inflows from operating assets and liabilities of $360.2 million. The decrease in cash inflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by the following:
•a decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable of $232.3 million in 2019 as compared to 2018;
•a decrease in changes in reserves and allowances and customer refund liabilities of $176.9 million in 2019 as compared to 2018; and
•a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $153.6 million in 2019 as compared to 2018.
This was partially offset by an increase in cash provided by changes in prepaid expenses and other assets of $132.2 million and an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $241.0 million year over year.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities decreased $55.8 million to $147.1 million in 2019 from $202.9 million in 2018, primarily due to lower capital expenditures and the purchase of an additional 10% common stock ownership in Dome Corporation ("]:
Item 1A. Risk Factors 22

["). As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with these ratios. In addition, the credit agreement contains events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, and includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other material indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement.
Borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) an alternate base rate, or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for U.S. Dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made (“adjusted LIBOR”), plus in each case an applicable margin. The applicable margin for loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the “Pricing Grid”) based on the consolidated leverage ratio and ranges between 1.00% to 1.25% for adjusted LIBOR loans and 0.00% to 0.25% for alternate base rate loans. The weighted average interest rate under the outstanding term loans was 3.2% during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings under the outstanding term loan. The weighted average interest rate under the revolving credit facility borrowings was 3.6% and 3.0% during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility and certain fees with respect to letters of credit. As of December 31, 2019, the commitment fee was 15 basis points. Since inception, we incurred and deferred $3.4 million in financing costs in connection with the credit agreement.

3.250% Senior Notes
In June 2016, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2026 (the “Notes”). The proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 beginning December 15, 2016. Prior to March 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), we may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or a “make-whole” amount applicable to such Notes as described in the indenture governing the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after March 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the Notes), we may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.
The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants, including limitations that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to create or incur secured indebtedness and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our properties or assets to another person, in each case subject to material exceptions described in the indenture. We incurred and deferred $5.3 million in financing costs in connection with the Notes.

Other Long Term Debt
In December 2012, we entered into a $50.0 million recourse loan collateralized by the land, buildings and tenant improvements comprising our corporate headquarters. In July 2018, this loan was repaid in full, without penalties, using borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Interest expense, net was $21.2 million, $33.6 million, and $34.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, bank fees, capital and built-to-suit lease interest and interest expense under the credit and other long term debt facilities. Amortization of deferred financing costs was $2.4 million, $1.5 million, and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
We monitor the financial health and stability of our lenders under the credit and other long term debt facilities, however during any period of significant instability in the credit markets lenders could be negatively impacted in their ability to perform under these facilities.

Contractual Commitments and Contingencies
We lease warehouse space, office facilities, space for our brand and factory house stores and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The leases expire at various dates through 2035, excluding extensions at our option, and include provisions for rental adjustments. In addition, this table includes executed lease agreements for brand and factory house stores that we did not yet occupy as of December 31, 2019. The operating leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time. Our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 as well as significant agreements entered into during the period after December 31, 2019 through the date of this report are summarized in the following table:

(1)   Includes estimated interest payments based on applicable fixed and currently effective floating interest rates as of December 31, 2019, timing of scheduled payments, and the term of the debt obligations.
(2)   Includes the minimum payments for lease obligations. The lease obligations do not include any contingent rent expense we may incur at our brand and factory house stores based on future sales above a specified minimum or payments made for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. Contingent rent expense was $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. In February 2020, we announced that we are considering foregoing opening a flagship store in New York City while pursuing sublet options for the long-term lease. The amounts included above reflect our existing contractual obligations with respect to that lease, which totaled $506.2 million as of December 31, 2019.
(3)   We generally place orders with our manufacturers at least three to four months in advance of expected future sales. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations primarily represent our open production purchase orders with our manufacturers for our apparel, footwear and accessories, including expected inbound freight, duties and other costs. These open purchase orders specify fixed or minimum quantities of products at determinable prices. The product purchase obligations also includes fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2019.
(4)   Includes sponsorships with professional teams, professional leagues, colleges and universities, individual athletes, athletic events and other marketing commitments in order to promote our brand. Some of these sponsorship agreements provide for additional performance incentives and product supply obligations. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products. The amount of product

provided to these sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, it is not possible to determine the performance incentive amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are primarily subject to certain performance based and other variables. The amounts listed above are the fixed minimum amounts required to be paid under these sponsorship agreements. Additionally, these amounts include minimum guaranteed royalty payments to endorsers and licensors based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products.
(5)  Represents the future cash payments due related to the Tax Act enacted in 2017 as part of the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
The table above excludes a liability of $37.2 million for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our uncertain tax positions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In connection with various contracts and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items. Generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent, engage in willful misconduct, or act in bad faith. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. We believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results.
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements. We consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts.
There were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2019. The following description of our critical accounting policies largely summarize generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and are meant to provide clarity regarding our existing application of these policies.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification 606 ("]:

[") to the extent that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. Such estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual customer redemptions.
Revenue from our licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to our trademarks and benefit from such access through their sales of licensed products. These arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements may be subject to a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Payments are generally due quarterly. We recognize revenue for sales-based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount) as licensed products are sold by the licensee. If a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is recognized as revenue over the contractual period. This sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best represents the value transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that we are entitled to receive in exchange for providing access to our trademarks.
Revenue from Connected Fitness subscriptions is recognized on a gross basis and is recognized over the term of the subscription. We receive payments in advance of revenue recognition for subscriptions and these payments are recorded as contract liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Related commission cost is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Revenue from Connected Fitness digital advertising is recognized as we satisfy performance obligations pursuant to customer insertion orders.
We record reductions to revenue at the time of the transaction for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. We base these estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which are inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates. If we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established, we would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination. Provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers. Reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts are included within customer refund liability and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were $219.4 million and $301.4 million, respectively, in reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts within customer refund liability and $61.1 million and $113.9 million, respectively, as the estimated value of inventory associated with the reserves for sales returns within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of revenue recognition.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the reserve, we consider historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgment about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from estimates. If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determine a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a benefit or charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the

45

Table of Contents
period in which such a determination was made. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $15.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively.
Inventory Valuation and Reserves
Inventories consist primarily of finished goods. Costs of finished goods inventories include all costs incurred to bring inventory to its current condition, including inbound freight, duties and other costs. We value our inventory at standard cost which approximates landed cost, using the first-in, first-out method of cost determination. Net realizable value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. If we determine that the estimated net realizable value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those that we projected, further adjustments may be required that would increase the cost of goods sold in the period in which such a determination was made.
Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and are allocated to the reporting units that are expected to receive the related benefits. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In conducting an annual impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that is the case, we perform the goodwill impairment test. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. We estimate fair value using the discounted cash flows model, under the income approach, which indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital, long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit']:
