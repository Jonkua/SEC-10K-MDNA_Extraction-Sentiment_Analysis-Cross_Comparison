Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Business Combinations – Allocation of Purchase Price

The Company’s Board of Directors and management regularly review strategic long-term plans, including potential investments in value-added acquisitions of related or similar businesses, which would increase the Company’s market presence and/or are related to the Company’s existing markets. When an acquisition is completed, the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings include the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition, which is the date control is obtained. The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of assets and equity interests given to the seller and any future obligations to the seller as of the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions. Further, the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets versus amounts assigned to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not amortized, can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and for periods subsequent to a business combination.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction, and, therefore, represents an exit price.  Fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants, considering the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible at the measurement date.  The Company assigns the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options:

 • Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities

 • Level 2 – Observable inputs, other than quoted prices, for similar assets or liabilities in active markets

 • Level 3 – Unobservable inputs, used to value the asset or liability which includes the use of valuation models

Level 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly traded long-term debt.

Level 2 fair values are typically used to value acquired receivables, inventories, machinery and equipment, land, buildings, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and accruals for payables, asset retirement obligations, environmental remediation and compliance obligations, and contingencies. Additionally, Level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at other-than-market rates.

Level 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and mineral interests produced and sold as final products, and separately-identifiable intangible assets. The fair values are determined using an excess earnings approach, which requires significant judgment to estimate future cash flows, net of capital investments in the specific operation and contributory asset charges. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Significant assumptions used to estimate future cash flows include changes in forecasted revenues based on sales price and shipment volumes as well as forecasted expenses inclusive of production costs and capital needs. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would require if purchasing the acquired business, with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows.

The Company values separately-identifiable acquired intangible assets which may include, but are not limited to, permits, customer relationships, water rights and noncompetition agreements. The fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method, a replacement cost method or, in the case of water rights, a market approach.

The useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and the remaining useful lives for acquired machinery and equipment have a significant impact on earnings. The selected lives are based on the expected periods that the assets will provide value to the Company subsequent to the business combination.

The Company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination during a measurement period after the acquisition date. Any such adjustments are based on the Company obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement-period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction. The measurement period ends once the Company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Net property, plant and equipment represented 44% (excluding the amount allocated to assets held for sale) of total assets at December 31, 2021. Accordingly, accounting for these assets represents a critical accounting policy. Useful lives of the assets can vary depending on factors, including production levels, geographic location, portability and maintenance practices. Additionally, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset. Historically, the Company has not recognized significant losses on the disposal or retirement of fixed assets.

Aggregates mineral reserves and mineral interests are components within the plant, property and equipment balance on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates aggregates reserves, including those used in the cement manufacturing process, in several ways, depending on the geology at a particular location and whether the location is a greensite, an acquisition or an existing operation. Greensites require an extensive drilling program before any significant investment is made in terms of time, site development or efforts to obtain appropriate zoning and permitting (see Environmental Regulation and Litigation section). The depth of overburden and the quality and quantity of the aggregates reserves are significant factors in determining whether to pursue opening the site. Further, the estimated average selling price for products in a market is also a significant factor in concluding that reserves are economically mineable. If the Company’s analysis based on these factors is satisfactory, the total aggregates reserves available are calculated and a determination is made whether to open the location. Reserve evaluation at existing locations is typically performed to evaluate purchasing adjoining properties, for quality control, calculating overburden volumes and for mine planning. Reserve evaluation of acquisitions may require a higher degree of sampling to locate any problem areas that may exist and to verify the total reserves.

Well-ordered subsurface sampling of the underlying deposit is basic to determining reserves at any location. This subsurface sampling usually involves one or more types of drilling, determined by the nature of the material to be sampled and the particular objective of the sampling. The Company’s objectives are to ensure that the underlying deposit meets aggregates specifications and the total reserves on site are sufficient for mining and economically recoverable. Locations underlain with hard rock deposits, such as granite and limestone, are drilled using the diamond core method, which provides the most useful and accurate samples of the deposit. Selected core samples are tested for soundness, abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry and depend on the aggregates use. The number and depth of the holes are determined by the size of the site and the complexity of the site-specific geology. Some geological factors that may affect the number and depth of holes include faults, folds, chemical irregularities, clay pockets, thickness of formations and weathering. A typical spacing of core holes on the area to be tested is one hole for every four acres, but wider spacing may be justified if the deposit is homogeneous.

Despite previous drilling and sampling, once accessed, the quality of reserves within a deposit can vary. Construction contracts, for the infrastructure market in particular, include specifications related to the aggregates material. If a flaw in the deposit is discovered, the aggregates material may not meet the required specifications. Although it is possible that the aggregates material can still be used for non-specification uses, this can have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to serve certain customers or on the Company’s profitability. In addition, other issues can arise that limit the Company’s ability to access reserves in a particular quarry, including geological occurrences, blasting practices and zoning issues.

Locations underlain with sand and gravel are typically drilled using the auger method, whereby a six-inch corkscrew brings up material from below the ground which is then sampled. Deposits in these locations are typically limited in thickness. Additionally, the quality and sand-to-gravel ratio of the deposit can vary both horizontally and vertically. Hole spacing at these locations is approximately one hole for every acre to ensure a representative sampling.

The geologist conducting the reserve evaluation makes the decision as to the number of holes and the spacing in accordance with standards and procedures established by the Company. Further, the anticipated heterogeneity of the deposit, based on U.S. geological maps, also dictates the number of holes drilled.

The generally accepted reserve categories for the aggregates industry and the designations the Company uses for reserve categories are summarized as follows:

Proven Reserves – These reserves are designated using closely spaced drill data as described above and a determination by a professional geologist that the deposit is relatively homogeneous based on the drilling results and exploration data provided in U.S. geologic maps, the U.S. Department of Agriculture soil maps, aerial photographs and/or electromagnetic, seismic or other surveys conducted by independent geotechnical engineering firms. The proven reserves that are recorded reflect reductions incurred through quarrying that result from leaving ramps, safety benches, pillars (underground) and the fines (small particles) that will be generated during processing. Proven reserves are further reduced by reserves that are under the plant and stockpile areas, as well as setbacks from neighboring property lines. The Company typically assumes a loss factor of 25%. However, the assumed loss

Form 10-K ♦ Page 64 SOAR to a Sustainable Future

Part II  ♦  Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

factor at coastal operations is approximately 40% due to the nature of the material. The assumed loss factor for underground operations is 35% primarily due to pillars.

Probable Reserves – These reserves are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes and/or assumptions about the economically recoverable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties.

The Company’s proven and probable reserves reflect reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and also include reserves at the Company’s inactive and undeveloped sites, including some sites where permitting and zoning applications will not be filed until warranted by expected future growth. The Company has historically been successful in obtaining and maintaining appropriate zoning and permitting (see Environmental Regulation and Litigation section).

Mineral reserves and mineral interests, when acquired in connection with a business combination, are valued using an excess earnings approach for the life of the proven and probable reserves.

The Company uses proven and probable reserves as the denominator in its units-of-production calculation to record depletion expense for its mineral reserves and mineral interests. For 2021, depletion expense was $46.0 million.

The Company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable, economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market. Capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences. Capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements.

New mining areas may be developed at existing quarries in order to access additional reserves. When this occurs, management reviews the facts and circumstances of each situation in making a determination as to the appropriateness of capitalizing or expensing the related pre-production development costs. If the additional mining location operates in a separate and distinct area of a quarry, the costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves. Further, a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional mining areas when the liability is incurred. Once a new mining area enters the production phase, all post-production stripping costs are expensed as incurred as periodic inventory production costs.

Part II  ♦  Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Further, increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability. If these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past, construction spending could be reduced. Cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations.

The Company’s principal business serves customers in construction markets. This concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private projects, mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables. The level of demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the Building Materials business and, therefore, profitability. Production costs in the Building Materials business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly. Diesel fuel, coal and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts. Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in the Company’s long-haul distribution network. The Magnesia Specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas.

Transportation in the Company’s long-haul network, particularly the supply of railcars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the Company’s efficient transportation of aggregates products in certain markets, most notably Texas, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and the Gulf Coast. In addition, availability of railcars and locomotives affects the Company’s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to both the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan, and its customers. The availability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the Company’s product, particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs.

All of the Company’s businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability. The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather. Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters.

Risks also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the Company’s control.

In addition to the foregoing, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report include but are not limited to those listed above in Item 1, “Business – Competition,” Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and “Note A: Accounting Policies” and “Note O: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

You should consider these forward-looking statements in light of risk factors discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and other filings made with the SEC.  All of the Company’s forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these factors.  In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company considers immaterial could affect the accuracy of its forward-looking statements, or adversely affect or be material to the Company.  All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of filing or publication and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
