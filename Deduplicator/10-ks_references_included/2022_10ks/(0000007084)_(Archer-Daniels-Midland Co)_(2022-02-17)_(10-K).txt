Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of ADM’s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. The primary source of funds to finance ADM’s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility and accounts receivable securitization programs.  In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets.

Cash provided by operating activities was $6.6 billion in 2021 compared to a use of $2.4 billion in 2020. Working capital changes as described below increased cash by $2.7 billion in the current year compared to a decrease of $5.5 billion in the prior year which included the impact of deferred consideration. During 2020, the Company restructured its accounts receivable securitization programs from a deferred purchase price to a pledge structure. As a result, operating cash flows in the current year no longer include the impact of deferred consideration in securitized receivables which decreased operating cash flows in previous years.

Trade receivables increased $0.6 billion primarily due to higher revenues. Inventories increased $2.8 billion primarily due to higher inventory prices and, to a lesser extent, higher volumes. Other current assets decreased $1.3 billion primarily due to decreases in contracts and futures gains. Trade payables increased $1.9 billion due principally to increased grain purchases. Payables to brokerage customers increased $2.5 billion due to increased customer trading activity in the Company’s futures commission and brokerage business.

Deferred consideration in securitized receivables of $4.6 billion in 2020 was offset by the same amount of net consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables.

Cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion this year compared to cash provided of $4.5 billion last year. Capital expenditures in the current year were $1.2 billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year. Net assets of businesses acquired were $1.6 billion this year compared to $15 million last year primarily due to the acquisitions of P4, Sojaprotein, and Deerland in 2021. Proceeds from sales of businesses and assets of $0.2 billion in the current year related to the sale of the ethanol production complex in Peoria, Illinois and certain other assets compared to $0.7 billion in the prior year which related to the sale of a portion of the Company shares in Wilmar and certain other assets. Net consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables was $4.6 billion in 2020.

Cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion this year compared to $0.4 billion last year. Long-term debt borrowings in the current year of $1.3 billion consisted of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.700% Notes due 2051 issued on September 10, 2021 and the €0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2022 issued in a private placement on March 25, 2021. Long-term debt borrowings in the prior year of $1.8 billion consisted of $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amounts of 2.75% Notes due in 2025 and 3.25% Notes due in 2030, respectively, issued on March 27, 2020 and the $0.3 billion aggregate principal amount of zero coupon exchangeable bonds due in 2023 issued on August 26, 2020. Proceeds from the borrowings in 2021 and 2020 were used to redeem debt and for general corporate purposes. Commercial paper net payments were $1.1 billion in the current year compared to net borrowings of $0.8 billion in the prior year. Long-term debt payments in the current year of $0.5 billion consisted of the early redemption of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due 2025 in September 2021. Long-term debt payments in the prior year of $2.1 billion related primarily to the early redemption of the $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion aggregate principal amounts of 4.479% debentures due in 2021 and 3.375% debentures due in 2022, respectively, the repurchase of $0.7 billion aggregate principal amount of certain outstanding notes and debentures, and the redemption of $0.2 billion aggregate principal amount of private placement notes due in 2021 and 2024. Share repurchases in the current year were insignificant compared to $0.1 billion in the prior year. Dividends paid in the current year of $0.8 billion were comparable to the prior year.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

At December 31, 2021, ADM had $0.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.5 to 1.  Included in working capital is $9.8 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  At December 31, 2021, the Company’s capital resources included shareholders’ equity of $22.5 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling $11.2 billion, of which $8.1 billion was unused.  ADM’s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders’ equity) was 26% and 28% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company uses this ratio as a measure of ADM’s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  The Company’s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders’ equity) was 28% and 32% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $5.0 billion supported the commercial paper borrowing programs, against which there was $0.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021.

During the second half of 2020, the global credit market stabilized with corporate credit spreads below pre-pandemic levels. Continued actions by central banks provided additional support in both the short-term and long-term funding markets further stabilizing corporate credit markets. Low benchmark yields and favorable credit spreads coupled with continued strong cash flow generation during the second half of 2020 presented opportunities for ADM to re-balance the company’s liability portfolio to pre-pandemic levels. Starting in June 2020, ADM began a series of liability management transactions including multiple early debt redemptions to capitalize on all-time low interest rates.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $0.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on the Company’s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $5.2 billion, the Company has asserted that these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.

The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. The Programs provide the Company with up to $2.3 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expand the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 19 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs). As of December 31, 2021, the Company utilized $2.2 billion of its facility under the Programs.

On November 5, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019. On August 7, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the extension of the stock repurchase program through December 31, 2024 and the repurchase of up to an additional 100,000,000 shares under the extended program. The Company has acquired approximately 95.5 million shares under this program as of December 31, 2021.

In 2022, the Company expects capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and additional cash outlays of approximately $0.9 billion in dividends and up to $150 million in share repurchases, subject to other strategic uses of capital and the evolution of operating cash flows and the working capital position throughout the year.

The Company’s purchase obligations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $18.6 billion and $19.7 billion, respectively.  The decrease is primarily related to obligations to purchase lower quantities of agricultural commodity inventories. As of December 31, 2021, the Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations of $15.8 billion within the next twelve months. The Company's other material cash requirements within the next 12 months include commercial paper outstanding of $0.8 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of $570 million, interest payments of $305 million, operating lease payments of $310 million, transition tax liability of $20 million, and pension and other postretirement plan contributions of $100 million. The Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations and other material cash requirements beyond the next twelve months of $18.2 billion.

The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2021.

The three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company’s credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies

The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  These estimates and judgments are based on the Company’s historical experience and management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Certain of the Company’s accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  Management has discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.  Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity Derivatives

Certain of the Company’s inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 are valued at estimated fair values, including $9.8 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $1.4 billion of commodity derivative assets, $1.8 billion of commodity derivative liabilities, and $1.0 billion of inventory-related payables.  Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward purchase and sales contracts for agricultural commodities. Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  Management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  The Company’s inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $3.5 billion of assets and $0.9 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 3, see Note 4 in Item 8.  Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.  Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.

Derivatives – Designated Hedging Activities

The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase or sales price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month. Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of revenues and/or cost of products sold.  See Note 5 in Item 8 for additional information.

Investments in Affiliates

The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.  These investments are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  Generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.  However, the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including, but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.

38

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.  For example, the Company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in Argentina and the Netherlands, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company.  The Company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information).

Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns where the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Company’s income statement.  The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  The Company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely. During 2021, the Company decreased valuation allowances by $52 million primarily related to expired state attributes. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or is unable to realize amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures amounting to approximately $12.7 billion at December 31, 2021, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

The Company has a responsibility to ensure that all ADM businesses within the Company follow responsible tax practices. ADM manages its tax affairs based upon the following key principles:
–a commitment to paying tax in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates;
–a commitment to the effective, sustainable, and active management of the Company's tax affairs; and
–developing and sustaining open and honest relationships with the governments and jurisdictions in which the Company operates regarding the formulation of tax laws.

Property, Plant, and Equipment and Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs

The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.  This business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.  Both the availability of the Company’s raw materials and the demand for the Company’s finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Company’s raw materials and finished products.  Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Company’s assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its facilities.  The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.  These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.  Management evaluates the Company’s property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.  In addition, assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, asset abandonment and impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment were $73 million, $28 million, and $131 million, respectively.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Business Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended. The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill. Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and related allocations. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings. The Company accounts for any redeemable noncontrolling interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.  The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.  The Company has seven reporting units identified at one level below the operating segment using the criteria in ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The Company adopted the provisions of Topic 350, which permits, but does not require, a company to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting unit’s fair value. If after completing the qualitative assessment, a company believes it is likely that a reporting unit is impaired, a discounted cash flow analysis is prepared to estimate fair value. Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, revenue growth, and discount rates. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment in six reporting units and using a quantitative assessment in one reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Definite-lived intangible assets, including capitalized expenses related to the Company’s 1ADM program such as third-party configuration costs and internal labor, are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 50 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying values may not be fully recoverable. The Company recorded impairment charges totaling $52 million related to goodwill and other intangibles, $26 million related to customer lists, and $11 million related goodwill and other intangibles during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively (see Note 18 in Item 8 for more information). If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.  The Company provides certain eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with subsidized postretirement health care coverage or Health Care Reimbursement Accounts.

40

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.  These estimates and assumptions are based on the Company’s historical experience combined with management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.  If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would result in a $90 million decrease to the Company's pension benefit obligation improving the funded status by the same amount while a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Company’s pension expense by $4 million.

The Company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses. Under the corridor approach, net unrecognized actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized over future periods. For plans with little to no active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants. For plans with active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active participants. The amortization periods range from 2 to 28 years for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans and from 6 to 21 years for the Company’s postretirement benefit plans.

Critical Accounting Policies

The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  These estimates and judgments are based on the Company’s historical experience and management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Certain of the Company’s accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  Management has discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.  Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity Derivatives

Certain of the Company’s inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 are valued at estimated fair values, including $9.8 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $1.4 billion of commodity derivative assets, $1.8 billion of commodity derivative liabilities, and $1.0 billion of inventory-related payables.  Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward purchase and sales contracts for agricultural commodities. Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.  Management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  The Company’s inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $3.5 billion of assets and $0.9 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 3, see Note 4 in Item 8.  Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.  Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.

Derivatives – Designated Hedging Activities

The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase or sales price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month. Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.  Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of revenues and/or cost of products sold.  See Note 5 in Item 8 for additional information.

Investments in Affiliates

The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.  These investments are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.  Generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.  However, the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including, but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.  These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.  For example, the Company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in Argentina and the Netherlands, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company.  The Company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information).

Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns where the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Company’s income statement.  The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  The Company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results. Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely. During 2021, the Company decreased valuation allowances by $52 million primarily related to expired state attributes. To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or is unable to realize amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures amounting to approximately $12.7 billion at December 31, 2021, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

The Company has a responsibility to ensure that all ADM businesses within the Company follow responsible tax practices. ADM manages its tax affairs based upon the following key principles:
–a commitment to paying tax in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates;
–a commitment to the effective, sustainable, and active management of the Company']:
