You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. All references to “Tenneco,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” refer to Tenneco Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Notes referenced in this discussion and analysis refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements that are found in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.

Refer to Item 1, “Business” for discussion of the Proposed Merger.

OVERVIEW
Our Business
We design, manufacture, market, and distribute products and services for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial, motorsport, and aftermarket customers. Our business consists of four operating segments, Motorparts, Performance Solutions, Clean Air, and Powertrain and serves both original equipment (“OE”) manufacturers and the repair and replacement markets worldwide. We supply OE parts to vehicle manufacturers for use in light vehicles, commercial vehicles, and other mobility markets; and the global aftermarket with replacement parts that are sold to wholesalers, retailers, and installers, as well as original equipment service (“OES”) parts to OE customers to support their service channels. We serve our customers through our brands, including Monroe®, Champion®, Öhlins®, MOOG®, Walker®, Fel-Pro®, Wagner®, Ferodo®, Rancho®, Thrush®, National®, and Sealed Power®; and others. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 196 manufacturing facilities worldwide and employed approximately 71,000 people to service our customers’ demands.

Factors that continue to be critical to our success include winning new business awards, managing our overall global manufacturing and fulfillment footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs, maintaining competitive wages and benefits, maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes, positioning the business to adapt to changes in vehicle electrification, and reducing overall costs. In addition, our ability to adapt to key industry trends, such as a shift in consumer preferences to other vehicles in response to higher fuel costs and other economic, social or environmental factors, increasing technologically sophisticated content, changing aftermarket distribution channels, increasing environmental standards, and extended product life of automotive parts, also play a critical role in our success. Other factors that are critical to our success include adjusting to economic challenges such as managing the availability of materials or increases in the cost of raw materials and our ability to successfully reduce the effect of any such cost increases through material substitutions, cost reduction initiatives, and other methods.

Change in Reportable Segments
In the first quarter of 2021, we made a change to our operating segments. This change consisted of moving a reporting unit from the Powertrain segment to the Ride Performance segment to align with a change in how our Chief Operating Decision Maker allocates resources and assesses performance against our key growth strategies. With this segment change and our enhanced focus on growth, Ride Performance was renamed Performance Solutions. As such, prior period operating segment results and related disclosures have been conformed to reflect our current operating segments.

Tenneco consists of four operating segments, Motorparts, Performance Solutions, Clean Air, and Powertrain:
•The Motorparts segment designs, manufactures, sources, markets, and distributes a broad portfolio of brand-name products in the global vehicle aftermarket while also servicing the OES market. Motorparts products are organized into categories, including shocks and struts, steering and suspension, braking, sealing, emissions control, engine, and maintenance;
•The Performance Solutions segment designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes a variety of products and systems designed to optimize the ride experience to a global OE customer base, including noise, vibration, and harshness performance materials, advanced suspension technologies, ride control, braking, and systems protection. Performance Solutions is agnostic to powertrain technologies;
•The Clean Air segment designs, manufactures, and distributes a variety of products and systems designed to     reduce pollution and optimize engine performance, acoustic tuning, and weight on a vehicle for light vehicle, commercial truck, and off-highway OE customers; and
•The Powertrain segment designs, manufactures, and distributes a variety of OE powertrain products for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, and industrial applications to OE customers for use in new vehicle production and OES parts to support their service and distribution channels.

Costs related to other business activities, primarily corporate headquarter functions, are disclosed separately from the four operating segments as “Corporate.” See Note 18, “Segment and Geographic Area Information”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2021
Consolidated revenues were $18,035 million, an increase of $2,656 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The primary driver of the increase is higher sales volume of $2,048 million, largely attributable to the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year. The remaining increase is attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $337 million, and the net favorable effects of other items of $290 million, which includes recoveries of commodity price increases. These were partially offset by the effects of divestitures contributing a $19 million decrease in revenues.

Cost of sales was $15,665 million, an increase of $2,263 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The primary driver of the increase is from higher sales volume of $1,697 million, largely attributable to the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year. The remaining increase is attributable to the unfavorable effects of materials sourcing of $422 million and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $297 million. This was partially offset by the decrease in cost of sales of $18 million related to the net effects of divestitures and the net favorable effects of other costs of $97 million, which includes $9 million of margin during the year ended December 31, 2020 on discontinued product that was previously written-down. In addition, the Motorparts segment recognized a non-cash charge of $44 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the write-down of inventory in connection with its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network, as compared to $82 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $38 million.

Results for the year ended December 31, 2021 was net income of $100 million as compared to a net loss of $1,460 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change from a net loss to net income was primarily driven by:
•a decrease in restructuring charges, net and non-cash asset impairment charges of $553 million primarily attributable to the impairment of long-lived asset groups recognized during year ended December 31, 2020 triggered by the effects of COVID-19 global pandemic on the Company’s projected financial information, and decrease in charges related to global headcount and cost reduction initiatives;
•a decrease in non-cash goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $383 million, which was comprised of $267 million of goodwill impairment charges, $65 million of definite-lived intangible asset impairments, and $51 million of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments recognized during year ended December 31, 2020;
•a decrease in income tax expense of $277 million primarily due to the full valuation allowances established for U.S. federal and state deferred taxes during the year ended December 31, 2020. This is partially offset by an increase in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to higher net taxable income in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions when compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2020;
•a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $46 million, primarily attributable to the effects of the impairments on property, plant and equipment recognized in the first quarter of 2020, as well as the effects of reductions in capital expenditures; and
•an increase in other income (expense), net of $34 million, primarily attributable to $32 million in gains on sale-leaseback transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021.

These favorable effects were partially offset by:
•an increase in selling, general, and administrative costs of $128 million, primarily due to higher compensation costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and also includes the effects of cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to the effects of COVID-19, which consisted of unpaid furloughs, net pay decreases, and temporary support programs during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was also a favorable antitrust reserve change in estimate for $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Recent Trends and Market Conditions
There is inherent uncertainty in the continuation of the trends discussed below. In addition, there may be other factors or trends that can have an effect on our business.

The principal raw material that we use is steel. We obtain steel from a number of sources pursuant to various contractual and other arrangements. Due to recent supply chain constraints within the automotive industry, we may encounter difficulty in obtaining steel and other commodities at current contractual prices and as a result may incur higher costs to procure these items. In addition, the automotive industry continues to face a shortage of semiconductors, which has led to production disruptions globally and created operating challenges for the automotive supplier base. In September 2021, IHS Markit lowered its 2022 global light vehicle production forecasts due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. We expect industry production to remain volatile for the foreseeable future and, sustained unfavorable commodity prices, volatility in commodity prices or changes in markets for a given commodity could negatively affect our operations.

We are experiencing other supply chain challenges, along with the effects of inflation on commodities and other purchases. Further, unfavorable conditions such as a general slowdown of the global or U.S. economy, uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, or inflation (including labor inflation) and rising interest rates could result in higher operating expenses and project costs for us.

Our business and operating results are affected by the relative strength of:

General economic conditions
Our OE business is directly related to automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive production levels depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions. Demand for aftermarket products is driven by four primary factors: the number of vehicles in operation; the average age of vehicles; vehicle usage trends (primarily miles driven); and component failure and wear rates.

The COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created extreme volatility and disruptions to capital and credit markets in the global financial markets. The extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic or subsequent resurgence of the outbreaks, the effects and extent of COVID-19 variants, related government responses, the rate of economic recovery from the pandemic, vaccination rates, and the effectiveness of available vaccines. There continues to be many uncertainties that remain related to COVID-19 that could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Global vehicle production levels
Light vehicle production (According to IHS Markit, February 2022)
Global light vehicle production increased slightly by 3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. Light vehicle production increased by 28% in India, 16% in South America, and 5% in China, while production levels were flat in North America and down by 4% in Europe.

Commercial truck production (According to IHS Markit, February 2022)
Global commercial truck production was flat for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. Commercial truck production increased by 21% in North America, 14% in Europe, 79% in India, and 61% in Brazil, while commercial truck production in China fell 20% in 2021 when compared to 2020 which substantially offset the production increases in other regions.

Fuel efficiency, powertrain evolution, and vehicle electrification
Various jurisdictions around the world have announced plans to limit the production of new diesel and gasoline powered vehicles in the future. Major vehicle manufacturers have announced their intention to reduce and phase out production of diesel and gasoline powered vehicles during the next two decades. However, for the foreseeable future, it is expected that the majority of the powertrains for light and commercial vehicles will be gasoline and diesel engines (including hybrids, which combine a battery electric drive with a combustion engine). While we see similar electrification trends for light vehicle and commercial vehicle, we expect light vehicles will experience those trends in advance of commercial vehicles. We expect to monitor those trends and adopt our business strategy accordingly.

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A)
SG&A increased by $128 million to $1,017 million compared to $889 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and also includes the effects of cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to the effects of COVID-19, which consisted of unpaid furloughs, net pay decreases, and temporary support programs during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was also a favorable antitrust reserve change in estimate for $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $46 million to $593 million as compared to $639 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily attributable to the effects of the impairments on property, plant and equipment recognized in the first quarter of 2020, as well as the effects of reductions in capital expenditures.

Engineering, research, and development
Engineering, research, and development increased by $12 million to $285 million as compared to $273 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to the favorable effects during the year ended December 31, 2020 of cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Restructuring charges, net and asset impairments
Restructuring charges, net and asset impairments decreased by $553 million to $69 million as compared to $622 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to the non recurrence of non-cash property, plant and equipment asset impairments in the Performance Solutions segment of $455 million, and non-cash asset impairment charges for operating lease right-of-use asset and property, plant and equipment in the Motorparts segment of $25 million related to its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, there was a decrease of $71 million (inclusive of an increase of $18 million in revisions to previously recorded estimates) for cash severance costs expected to be paid as part of global headcount and cost reduction actions, including plant closures, across all segments and regions, and a decrease of $10 million for operating lease right-of-use asset and property, plant and equipment impairment charges in the corporate component, partially offset by an increase of $8 million in impairments related to assets held for sale for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

Goodwill and intangible impairment charges
Goodwill and intangible impairment charges decreased by $383 million, which was comprised of $267 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges, $65 million of non-cash definite-lived intangible asset impairments, and $51 million of non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2020, which were the result of the effects of COVID-19 on the projected financial information during the first quarter of 2020.

Non-service pension and postretirement benefit (costs)/credits
Non-service pension and postretirement benefit (costs)/credits decreased by $5 million to a net credit of $13 million as compared to a net credit of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily attributable to the elimination of certain retirement health care benefits for participants in one of our union agreements in the U.S. that resulted in a non-cash curtailment gain of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This was partially offset by a decrease in non-cash settlement charges of $6 million in connection with a plant closure. The remaining increase in the net credit is primarily attributable to lower interest costs resulting from lower discount rates, partially offset by higher amortization expense.

Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax
Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax increased by $10 million to $57 million as compared to $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year affecting the equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates located in Turkey, China and Korea.

Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt
A non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $8 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the discharge of the 4.875% euro floating rate notes due 2024 and 5.000% euro fixed rate notes due 2024. A non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $2 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the redemption of the 4.875% euro denominated senior secured notes during the fourth quarter of 2020.

Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net increased by $34 million to $72 million as compared to $38 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to $32 million in gains on sale-leaseback transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Interest expense
Interest expense decreased by $3 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) to $274 million as compared to $277 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $3 million decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense on lower average outstanding borrowings on the revolver and term loans and the effects of lower interest rates on variable rate debt, partially offset by the effects of higher interest rates on fixed rate debt during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Income tax (expense) benefit
Income tax expense decreased by $277 million to $182 million on earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $282 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to income tax expense of $459 million on loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to the full valuation allowances established for U.S. federal and state deferred taxes during the year ended December 31, 2020. This is partially offset by an increase in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to higher net taxable income in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions when compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Net income (loss)
Results for the year ended December 31, 2021 was net income of $100 million as compared to a net loss of $1,460 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the aforementioned items.

Segment Results of Operations

Overview of Net Sales and Operating Revenues
Our Clean Air segment has substrate sales. Substrates are porous ceramic filters coated with a catalyst - typically, precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. We do not manufacture substrates, they are supplied to us by Tier 2 suppliers generally directed by our OE customers. We generally earn a small margin on these components of the system. These substrate components have been increasing as a percentage of our revenue as the need grows for more sophisticated emission control solutions to meet more stringent environmental regulations, particularly for commercial on road and off-road vehicles, and as we capture more diesel aftertreatment business. While these substrates dilute our gross margin percentage, they are a necessary component of an emission control system.

We disclose substrate sales amounts because we believe investors utilize this information to understand the effect of this portion of our revenues on our overall business and because it removes the effect of potentially volatile precious metals pricing from our revenues. While our OE customers generally assume the risk of precious metals pricing volatility, it affects our reported revenues.

The table below reflects the main drivers for changes in our segment revenues (amounts in millions):

Segment Revenue
The primary factor contributing to the increase in sales volume for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, is the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year. Additional factors by segment are discussed below.

Motorparts
Motorparts revenue increased $266 million, or 10%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Higher sales volume contributed $129 million to the increase, foreign currency exchange had a $28 million favorable effect on Motorparts revenues and other net favorable effects, which includes recoveries of commodity price increases, contributed $128 million to the increase. These favorable effects were slightly offset by the decrease in revenues from divestitures of $19 million.

Performance Solutions
Performance Solutions revenue increased $406 million, or 16%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Higher light vehicle, commercial truck, and off-highway and other vehicle revenue contributed $288 million to the increase, foreign currency exchange had a $64 million favorable effect on Performance Solutions revenue, while other favorable effects, which includes recoveries of commodity price increases, increased revenue by $54 million.

Clean Air
Clean Air revenue increased $1,414 million, or 21%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the increase in substrate sales of $936 million and the increase in value-add revenue of $478 million. Overall for the Clean Air segment, the main drivers of the value-add revenue increase was higher volume of $340 million attributable to the revenue from commercial truck, OES and off-highway and other, while light vehicle also improved and contributed to the value-add revenue increase when compared to the prior year. In addition, foreign currency exchange had a $70 million favorable effect on Clean Air value-add revenue, while other favorable effects, which includes recoveries of commodity price increases, increased value-add revenue by $68 million.

Table of Contents

Powertrain
Powertrain revenue increased $570 million, or 17%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $453 million is primarily attributable to higher sales volume for commercial truck, light vehicle and OES, while industrial, off-highway and other revenues also improved and contributed to the increase when compared to the prior year. In addition, foreign currency exchange had a $77 million favorable effect on Powertrain revenue, while other favorable effects, which includes recoveries of commodity price increases, increased revenue by $40 million.

EBITDA including noncontrolling interests
The following table presents the EBITDA including noncontrolling interests by segment (amounts in millions):

----------------------------------------------------- ---------------------- --- ------------------- - ----- - ---
 Year Ended December 31 2021 vs 2020 Change
 2021 2020
EBITDA including noncontrolling interests by Segment:
Motorparts $ 375 $ 155 $ 220
Performance Solutions $ 119 $ (634) $ 753
Clean Air $ 584 $ 440 $ 144
Powertrain $ 346 $ 169 $ 177

Motorparts
Motorparts EBITDA including noncontrolling interests increased $220 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volume and favorable mix, improved operating performance, favorable material sourcing and the non-recurrence of goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $110 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. Also contributing to the increase in EBITDA including noncontrolling interests is the decrease in a non-cash charge to cost of sales of $38 million related to the write-down of inventory, a decrease in asset impairment charges of $24 million recognized in connection with its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network, and a decrease in restructuring charges related to cash severance benefits and other costs of $12 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher SG&A costs (includes the prior year effects of cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to the effects of COVID-19) during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

Performance Solutions
Performance Solutions EBITDA including noncontrolling interests increased $753 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to the non-recurrence of asset impairment charges of $455 million and goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $232 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. Also contributing to the increase is higher sales volume, lower pension and postretirement benefit costs due to a plant closure during the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease in restructuring charges related to cash severance benefits and other costs of $13 million, and a decrease in other restructuring related charges of $36 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to prior year. These favorable factors were partially offset by the effects of unfavorable materials sourcing, unfavorable operating performance and unfavorable mix during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

Clean Air
Clean Air EBITDA including noncontrolling interests increased $144 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volume, favorable operating performance, favorable material sourcing, gains on sale-leaseback transactions for $32 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021, and a decrease in restructuring charges related to cash severance benefits and other costs of $15 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. These favorable factors were partially offset by the effects of unfavorable mix and other non-restructuring asset impairments of $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, and the favorable antitrust reserve change in estimate for $11 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Powertrain
Powertrain EBITDA including noncontrolling interests increased $177 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to higher sales volume, favorable operating performance, the non recurrence of goodwill impairment charge of $41 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, and a decrease in restructuring charges related to cash severance benefits and other costs of $28 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. These favorable factors were partially offset by unfavorable material sourcing during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

Revenues
Revenues decreased by $2,071 million, or 12%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary driver of the decrease is lower sales volume and unfavorable mix of $1,810 million, largely attributable to the effects of COVID-19. The remaining decrease is attributable to a decrease in revenues of $106 million, or less than 1%, related to the net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $89 million, and the net unfavorable effects of other of $66 million.

Cost of sales
Cost of sales decreased by $1,510 million, or 10%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary driver of the decrease is from lower sales volume of $1,212 million, largely attributable to the effects of COVID-19. The remaining decrease is attributable to a decrease in cost of sales of $96 million, or less than 1%, related to the net effects of acquisitions and divestitures, the favorable effects of materials sourcing of $87 million, the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $60 million, and the net favorable effects of other costs of $137 million. This was partially offset by a non-cash charge of $82 million related to the write-down of inventory in the Motorparts segment in connection with its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network. Included in other costs of $137 million, is $9 million of margin on discontinued product that was previously written-down.

Selling, general, and administrative
SG&A decreased by $249 million to $889 million compared to $1,138 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to $88 million in lower acquisition and expected separation costs, and the favorable effects of cost reduction initiatives implemented in response to the effects of COVID-19, including unpaid furloughs, net pay decreases, temporary support programs, and other compensation related expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, SG&A includes a reduction of $9 million recognized for a non-income tax refund received in the year ended December 31, 2020.

Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $34 million to $639 million compared to $673 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to the effects of the impairments on property, plant and equipment recognized in the first quarter of 2020.

Engineering, research, and development
Engineering, research, and development decreased by $51 million to $273 million as compared to $324 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to the effects of COVID-19 and the favorable effects of cost reduction initiatives.

Restructuring charges, net and asset impairments
Restructuring charges, net and asset impairments increased by $496 million to $622 million as compared to $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to non-cash property, plant and equipment asset impairments in the Performance Solutions segment of $455 million; non-cash asset impairment charges in the Motorparts segment of $25 million related to its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network; and a non-cash asset impairment charge of $17 million for operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment in the corporate component during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, there was an increase of $6 million for cash severance costs expected to be paid as part of global headcount and cost reduction actions across all segments and regions, including plant closures, which was more than offset by a decrease of $6 million in impairments related to assets held for sale and a decrease in other asset impairments of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Goodwill and intangible impairment charges
Goodwill and intangible impairment charges increased by $142 million to $383 million as compared to $241 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to $267 million of non-cash goodwill impairment charges, $65 million of non-cash definite-lived intangible asset impairments, and $51 million of non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments during the year ended December 31, 2020, which was the result of the effects of COVID-19 on the projected financial information during the first quarter of 2020. This compared to $108 million of goodwill impairment charges recognized for three of our reporting units for the year ended December 31, 2019. These non-cash goodwill impairment charges included $69 million in the Performance Solutions segment as a result of our reporting unit reorganization and a $21 million impairment charge in the Motorparts segment, and an $18 million impairment charge in the Powertrain segment as a result of our goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, as a result of our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2019, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $133 million were recorded for two reporting units in the Motorparts segment.

Non-service pension and postretirement benefit (costs) credits
Non-service pension and postretirement benefit (costs) credits increased by $29 million to a net credit of $18 million as compared to a net cost of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily attributable to the elimination of certain health care benefits in retirement for participants in one of our union agreements that resulted in a non-cash curtailment gain of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a curtailment gain of $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulting from the plan amendments approved during 2019 to eliminate postretirement benefits for certain nonunion employees. The remaining change was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate, which was partially offset by a higher amortization and a lower expected return on plan assets due to a lower long-term rate of return.

Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax
Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax increased by $4 million to $47 million as compared to $43 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2019, a non-cash reduction of $12 million was recognized as a result of finalizing purchase accounting for the Federal-Mogul LLC acquisition, and completing the purchase price allocation for certain equity method investments, which represents amounts to recognize the basis difference between the fair value and book value of certain assets, including inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. After the purchase accounting adjustments in the prior year, equity earnings (losses) decreased year over year primarily due to the effects of COVID-19 on the equity in earnings (losses) of our nonconsolidated affiliates located in Turkey, China, Korea, and the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt
A non-cash gain on extinguishment of debt of $2 million was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the redemption of the 4.875% euro denominated senior secured notes during the fourth quarter of 2020.

Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net decreased by $15 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to a recovery of value-added tax in a foreign jurisdiction for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Interest expense
Interest expense decreased by $45 million to $277 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations), net of interest capitalized of $3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $322 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations), net of interest capitalized of $5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The $45 million decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt, partially offset by higher interest expense on higher average outstanding borrowings on the revolver during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense also included losses on sales of accounts receivables, which was $20 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $31 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Income tax (expense) benefit
Income tax expense increased by $440 million to $459 million on loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $1,001 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to income tax expense of $19 million on loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily the result of the $507 million in non-cash charges to tax expense relating to the full valuation allowances established for the U.S. deferred taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $98 million in non-cash charges to tax expense for changes in valuation allowance for deferred taxes relating to non-U.S. jurisdictions. This is partially offset by the federal and state tax benefits and foreign rate differential on the change of the loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $186 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Segment Revenue
Motorparts
Motorparts revenue decreased $442 million, or 14%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower sales across all regions in which we operate contributed $356 million to the decrease, as well as a decrease in revenues from divestitures of $76 million, and foreign currency exchange had a $55 million unfavorable effect on Motorparts revenues. The unfavorable effects were partially offset by other net favorable effects of $45 million.

Performance Solutions
Performance Solutions revenue decreased $598 million, or 19%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, and other vehicle revenues contributed $549 million to the decrease, as well as a decrease in revenues from divestitures of $23 million. Foreign currency exchange had a $6 million unfavorable effect on Performance Solutions revenue, while other unfavorable effects decreased revenue by $20 million.

Clean Air
Clean Air revenue decreased $400 million, or 6%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in value-add revenue of $728 million, partially offset by the increase in substrate sales of $328 million. Overall for the Clean Air segment, lower light vehicle and off-highway and other revenues were the main drivers of the value-add revenue decline while commercial truck improved when compared to the prior year. In addition, foreign currency exchange had a $4 million unfavorable effect on Clean Air value-add revenue while other unfavorable effects decreased value-add revenue by $62 million.

Powertrain
Powertrain revenue decreased $631 million, or 16%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Lower light vehicle, commercial truck, industrial, and off-highway and other vehicle revenue contributed $580 million to the decrease, as well as a decrease in revenues from divestitures of $7 million. Foreign currency exchange had a $15 million unfavorable effect on Powertrain revenue, while other unfavorable effects decreased revenue by $29 million.

Table of Contents

Motorparts
Motorparts EBITDA including noncontrolling interests decreased $29 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and unfavorable mix, an increase in goodwill impairment charge of $49 million and a non-cash charge to cost of sales of $82 million related to the write-down of inventory recognized in connection with its initiative to rationalize its supply chain and distribution network as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable operating performance, lower SG&A costs and a decrease in indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $93 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Performance Solutions
Performance Solutions EBITDA including noncontrolling interests decreased $748 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to asset impairment charges of $455 million and goodwill and intangible impairment charges of $232 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a goodwill impairment charge of $69 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019. Also contributing to the decrease is lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by lower SG&A and engineering, research, and development costs.

Clean Air
Clean Air EBITDA including noncontrolling interests decreased $142 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable operating performance and lower SG&A costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Powertrain
Powertrain EBITDA including noncontrolling interests decreased $88 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and unfavorable mix, an increase in cash severance charges expected to be paid of $19 million, and an increase in goodwill impairment charge of $23 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by favorable operating performance and lower SG&A and engineering, research, and development costs. Included in the lower SG&A costs is a reduction of $9 million for a non-income tax refund received in the year ended December 31, 2020.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
This section discusses our liquidity and capital resources, including cash flow activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Discussion of our cash flow activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 can be found under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 24, 2021.

Liquidity and Financing Arrangements
For the reasons discussed above under “Recent Trends and Market Conditions - General economic conditions”, there continues to be many uncertainties that remain related to COVID-19 and the ongoing semiconductor shortage, other supply chain challenges, and the effects of inflation on commodities, other purchases, and labor costs that could negatively affect our liquidity and cash flows.

We believe cash flows from operations, combined with our cash on hand and committed and undrawn capacity under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements, including debt amortization, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and other operational requirements, for the following year based on our current estimates and forecasts. We believe we will maintain compliance with our financial ratios set forth in our amended credit agreement. However, our ability to meet the financial covenants depends upon a number of operational and economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. In the event we are unable to meet these financial covenants, we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs. Such actions include additional restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions, sales of assets, reductions to working capital and capital spending, issuance of equity, and other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position. We also continue to actively monitor credit market conditions for the right opportunity to replace and extend maturity.

Credit Facilities
The table below shows our borrowing capacity on committed credit facilities at December 31, 2021 (amounts in billions):

------------------------------------------ ----------------- ------------ ---
 December 31, 2021
 Term Available(b)
Tenneco Inc. revolving credit facility (a) 2023 $ 1.4
Tenneco Inc. Term Loan A 2023 —
Tenneco Inc. Term Loan B 2025 —
Subsidiaries’ credit agreements 2022-2028 —
 $ 1.4

(a)We are required to pay commitment fees under the revolving credit facility on the unused portion of the total commitment.
(b)At December 31, 2021, the Company had $69 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, which reduces the available borrowings under revolving credit facility. We also had $76 million of outstanding letters of credit under our uncommitted facilities at December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, we had liquidity of $2.3 billion comprised of $865 million of cash and $1.4 billion undrawn on our revolving credit facility. We had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2021.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, we issued a $42 million letter of credit under our revolving credit facility that is included in the $69 million of total outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2021, which reduces the available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The letter of credit supports a 1.7 billion Mexican peso (approximately $82 million using the exchange rate at December 31, 2021) surety bond issued to the Mexican tax authority. The surety bond is required in order for us to enter into the judicial process to appeal a tax assessment and covers the amount of the assessment plus interest. We do not believe it is probable we will have to pay the assessment or related interest. We also received a second assessment during the fourth quarter of 2021 from the Mexican tax authority of 0.6 billion Mexican peso (approximately $28 million using the exchange rate at December 31, 2021) for a separate matter, which has not required the issuance of a surety bond at this time. We do not believe it is probable we will have to pay this second assessment or related interest.

Term Loans
We entered into a new credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and other lenders (the “New Credit Facility”) in October 2018, which has been amended by the first amendment, dated February 14, 2020 (the “First Amendment”), by the second amendment, dated February 14, 2020 (the “Second Amendment”), and by the third amendment, dated May 5, 2020 (the “Third Amendment”). The New Credit Facility consists of $4.9 billion of total debt financing, consisting of a five-year $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a five-year $1.7 billion term loan A facility (“Term Loan A”) and a seven-year $1.7 billion term loan B facility (“Term Loan B”). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $18 million in one-time fees in connection with these amendments.

New Credit Facility — Interest Rates
At December 31, 2021, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility was LIBOR plus 1.75% and will remain at LIBOR plus 1.75% for each relevant period for which our consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) is less than 3.0 to 1 and greater than 2.5 to 1. The interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility are subject to step downs in accordance with the credit agreement.

The New Credit Facility prescribes for an alternative method of determining interest rates in the event LIBOR is not available.

New Credit Facility — Other Terms and Conditions
The financial ratios required under the New Credit Facility and the actual ratios we calculated at December 31, 2021 are as follows: senior secured net leverage ratio of 2.59 actual versus 4.00 (maximum required under the Third Amendment); and interest coverage ratio of 5.79 actual versus 2.75 (minimum required under the Third Amendment).

Further information on interest rates, fees, and other terms and conditions of the New Credit Facility, refer to Note 9, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements” included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional details.

Senior Notes
A summary of our senior unsecured and secured notes at December 31, 2021 are as follows (amounts in millions):

(a) Carrying amount is net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $29 million at December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding 5.375% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2024 (“2024 Senior Notes”) and 5.000% senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2026 (“2026 Senior Notes” and together with the 2024 Senior Notes, the “Senior Unsecured Notes”). We also had outstanding 7.875% senior secured notes due January 15, 2029 (“7.875% Senior Secured Notes”) which were issued on November 30, 2020, and 5.125% senior secured notes due April 15, 2029 (“5.125% Senior Secured Notes”) which were issued on March 17, 2021. The 7.875% Senior Secured Notes and 5.125% Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Senior Secured Notes”) were outstanding at December 31, 2021.

On March 3, 2021, we provided notice of our intention to redeem all of the outstanding 5.000% euro denominated senior secured notes due July 15, 2024 (the “2024 Fixed Rate Secured Notes”) and all of the outstanding floating rate euro denominated senior secured notes due April 15, 2024 (the “2024 Floating Rate Secured Notes” and, together with the 2024 Fixed Rate Secured Notes, the “2024 Secured Notes”). On March 17, 2021, we, using the net proceeds of the offering of 5.125% Senior Secured Notes, together with cash on hand, satisfy and discharge each of the indentures governing the 2024 Secured Notes in accordance with their terms. As a result, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes — Other Terms and Conditions
The Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to create liens on our assets and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes and 2024 Senior Notes also contain covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends, make distributions to stockholders and repurchase stock; (iii)  make investments; (iv) sell assets; (v) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (vi) undertake mergers and consolidations.

Subject to limited exceptions, all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes on a joint and several basis. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed our Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes to make distributions to us.

Further information on interest rates, fees, and other terms and conditions of the Senior Unsecured and Senior Secured Notes, refer to Note 9, “Debt and Other Financing Arrangements” included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional details.

Factoring Arrangements
In our accounts receivable factoring programs, accounts receivables are transferred in their entirety to the acquiring entities and are accounted for as a sale. The fair value of assets received as proceeds in exchange for the transfer of accounts receivable under these factoring programs approximates the fair value of such receivables. Some of these programs have deferred purchase price arrangements with the banks.

We are the servicer of the receivables under some of these arrangements and are responsible for performing all accounts receivable administration functions. Where we receive a fee to service and monitor these transferred accounts receivables, such fees are sufficient to offset the costs and as such, a servicing asset or liability is not recorded as a result of such activities.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of accounts receivable outstanding and derecognized for factoring arrangements was $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion, of which $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion relate to accounts receivable where we have continuing involvement. In addition, the deferred purchase price receivable was $51 million and $51 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, proceeds from the factoring of accounts receivable qualifying as sales were $5.2 billion and $4.1 billion, of which $3.9 billion and $3.3 billion were received on accounts receivable where we have continuing involvement.

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our financing charges associated with the factoring of receivables, which are included in “Interest expense” in the consolidated statements of income (loss), were $19 million and $20 million.

If we were not able to factor receivables under these programs, our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement might increase. These programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $233 million, a decrease of $396 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is attributable to an unfavorable change in operating cash flow of $846 million due to unfavorable changes in working capital items, partially offset by an improvement in net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities of $450 million. We utilize factoring agreements with deferred purchase price, which are reflected as investing activities and not operating activities. Had we not entered into such agreements, these proceeds would have been reported as cash from operations.

If we do not maintain compliance with the terms of our New Credit Facility or senior notes indentures described above, all amounts under those arrangements could, automatically or at the option of the lenders or other debt holders, become due. Additionally, each of those facilities contains provisions that certain events of default under one facility will constitute a default under the other facility, allowing the acceleration of all amounts due. We currently expect to maintain compliance with the terms of all of our various credit agreements for the foreseeable future.

Included in our contractual obligations is the amount of interest to be paid on our long-term debt. As our debt structure contains both fixed and variable rate obligations, we have made assumptions in calculating the amount of future interest payments. Interest on our Senior Unsecured Notes is calculated using the fixed rates of 5.375% and 5.000%, and interest on our fixed rate Senior Secured Notes is calculated using the fixed rates of 7.875% and 5.125%. Interest on our variable rate debt is calculated as LIBOR plus the applicable margin in effect at December 31, 2021 for our term loans. We have assumed that rates will remain unchanged for the outlying years.

We have also included an estimate of expenditures required after December 31, 2021 to complete the projects authorized at December 31, 2021, in which we have made substantial commitments in connection with purchasing property, plant and equipment for our operations. For 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $400 million and $450 million.

We have included an estimate of the expenditures necessary after December 31, 2021 to satisfy purchase requirements pursuant to certain ordinary course supply agreements that we have entered into. With respect to our other supply agreements, they generally do not specify the volumes we are required to purchase. In many cases, if any commitment is provided, the agreements state only the minimum percentage of our purchase requirements we must buy from the supplier. As a result, these purchase obligations fluctuate from year-to-year and we are not able to quantify the amount of our future obligations.

We have not included the potential cash requirement to redeem the shares of one of our noncontrolling interest holders. This became redeemable on January 10, 2022 upon the third anniversary of the Öhlins acquisition. The redemption value of this noncontrolling interest was $41 million at December 31, 2021.

We have not included material cash requirements for unrecognized tax benefits or taxes. It is difficult to estimate taxes to be paid as changes in where we generate income can have a significant effect on our future tax payments.

Based upon current estimates, we believe we will be required to make contributions of approximately $68 million to our pension and postretirement benefits plans in 2022. Pension and postretirement contributions beyond 2022 will be required but those amounts will vary based upon many factors, including the performance of our pension fund investments during 2022 and future discount rate changes. For additional information relating to the funding of our pension and other postretirement plans, refer to Note 11, “Pension Plans, Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

In addition, we have not included cash requirements for environmental remediation. Based upon current estimates, we believe we will be required to spend approximately $31 million over the next 30 years, including $8 million of expected payments in 2022. However, due to possible modifications in remediation processes and other factors, it is difficult to determine the actual timing and extent of cash payments. Refer to Note 13, “Commitments and Contingencies”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

We occasionally provide guarantees that could require us to make future payments in the event that the third-party primary obligor does not make its required payments. We are not required to record a liability for any of these guarantees.

Additionally, we have from time to time issued guarantees for the performance of obligations by some of our subsidiaries, and some of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our debt. Substantially all of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our New Credit Facility and our senior notes on a joint and several basis. The New Credit Facility is also secured by first-priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of up to 66% of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries. As described above, certain of our senior notes are secured by pledges of stock and assets.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates. Our significant accounting policies have been disclosed in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. The following paragraphs include a discussion of certain policies as well as critical areas where estimates are required.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We evaluate goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate goodwill might be impaired. We perform assessments at the reporting unit level by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. If the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds the fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired. Our assessment of fair value utilizes a combination of the income approach, market approach, and, in instances where a reporting unit’s free cash flows do not support the value of the underlying assets, an asset approach. In our assessment, for reporting units where the free cash flows support the value of the underlying assets, we apply a 75% weighting to the income approach and a 25% weighting to the market approach. The most significant inputs in estimating the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach are (i) projected operating margins, (ii) the revenue growth rate, and (iii) the discount rate, which is risk-adjusted based on the aforementioned inputs.

Similar to goodwill, we evaluate our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicated the assets might be impaired. We perform a quantitative assessment of estimating fair values based upon the prospective stream of hypothetical after-tax royalty cost savings discounted at rates that reflect the rates of return appropriate for these intangible assets. The primary inputs utilized in determining fair values of our trade names and trademarks are (i) our projected branded product sales, (ii) the revenue growth rate, (iii) the royalty rate, and (iv) the discount rate, which is risk-adjusted based on our projected branded sales.

The basis of the goodwill impairment and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses is our annual budget and three-year strategic plan. This includes a projection of future cash flows based on new products, awarded business, customer commitments, and independent market data, which requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows and revenue growth rates. The key factors that affect our estimates are (i) future production estimates; (ii) customer preferences and decisions; (iii) product pricing; (iv) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (v) product life / business retention. These estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.

While we believe the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable, due to the many variables inherent in estimating fair value and the relative size of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the results of our analysis. Refer to Note 6, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information regarding our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

The following table shows a summary of the number of reporting units with a net carrying value of goodwill in each segment at December 31, 2021 and whether or not the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value by more or less than 25% based on each respective reporting units most recent goodwill impairment analysis:

Table of Contents

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
We monitor our long-lived and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment indicators on an on-going basis. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the long-lived asset group for recoverability by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset group to its net carrying value. If the net carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset group is written down to its fair value and an impairment loss is recognized. Even if an impairment charge is not recognized, a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets.

The basis of the recoverability test is our annual budget and three-year strategic plan. This includes a projection of future cash flows based on new products, awarded business, customer commitments, and independent market data, which requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows and revenue growth rates. The key factors that affect our estimates are (i) future production estimates; (ii) customer preferences and decisions; (iii) product pricing; (iv) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (v) product life / business retention. These estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.

While we believe the projections of anticipated future cash flows and related assumptions are reasonable, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the results of our analysis.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
We sponsor defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Our defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, mortality rates of participants, expected rates of mortality improvement, and health care cost trend rates.

The approach to establishing the discount rate assumption for both our domestic and international plans is based on high-quality corporate bonds. The weighted average discount rates used to calculate net periodic benefit cost for 2021 and year-end obligations at December 31, 2021 were as follows:

------------------------------------------- ---------------- - -------------------- --- -------- --- -
 Pension Benefits Other Postretirement
 U.S. Non-U.S.
 Plans Plans Benefits
Used to calculate net periodic benefit cost 2.3 % 1.5 % 2.5 %
Used to calculate benefit obligations 2.8 % 1.9 % 2.9 %

Our approach to establishing the assumption for the expected return on assets utilizes estimates of future long-term investment performance for the plan based upon the asset allocation strategy and is primarily a long-term prospective rate. As a result, our estimate of the weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets for all of our pension plans decreased to 4.7% in 2021 from 5.1% in 2020.

Our pension plans generally do not require employee contributions. Our policy is to fund these pension plans in accordance with applicable domestic and international government regulations. At December 31, 2021, all legal funding requirements had been met.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. The changes in these assumptions have no effect on our funding requirements.

Refer to Note 11, “Pension Plans, Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information regarding our pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs and assumptions.

Warranty Reserves
We provide warranties on some, but not all, of our products. The warranty terms vary but range from one year up to limited lifetime warranties on some of our premium aftermarket products. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified on OE products. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims and upon specific warranty issues as they arise. While we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs, it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities which reflect the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax reporting values. Future tax benefits of net operating losses (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each tax jurisdiction. In the event our operating performance deteriorates in a filing jurisdiction or entity, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate. Refer to Note 12, “Income Taxes”, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.

In addition, the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to complexity of some of these uncertainties and the effect of any tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may be materially different from our estimated liabilities.

We are exposed to certain global market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, interest rate risk associated with our debt, and equity price risk associated with our share-based compensation awards.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We manufacture and sell our products globally. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we manufacture and sell our products. We generally try to use natural hedges within our foreign currency activities to minimize foreign currency risk. Where natural hedges are not in place, we consider managing certain aspects of our foreign currency activities and larger transactions through the use of foreign currency options or forward contracts.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
We enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third-party trade receivables and payables and intercompany loans. The fair value of these derivative instruments is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.

The following table summarizes by position the notional amounts for foreign currency forward contracts at December 31, 2021, all of which mature in the next twelve months (amounts in millions):

--------------- --------------- ---
 Notional Amount
Long positions $ 401
Short positions $ 396

A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the U.S. relative to all other currencies would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to changes in the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to translation of the results of certain international operations into U.S. dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.

The following table summarizes the amounts of foreign currency translation and transaction losses (amounts in millions):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------- ---- ---- - ----
 Year Ended December 31
 2021 2020
Translation gains (losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ (83) $ (12)
Transaction gains (losses) recorded in earnings $ (20) $ (17)

Commodity Price Risk
Our production processes are dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials that are exposed to price fluctuations on the open market. Commodity rate price forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices for raw materials. We monitor our commodity price risk exposures regularly to maximize the overall effectiveness of our commodity forward contracts. The fair value of our commodity price forward contracts is not considered material to the consolidated financial statements.

Interest Rate Risk
Our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are primarily our debt securities. We use our revolving credit facility to finance our short-term and long-term capital requirements. We pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings. Our long-term capital requirements have been financed with long-term debt with original maturity dates ranging from five to ten years. At December 31, 2021, we had $2.0 billion par value of fixed rate debt and $3.1 billion par value of floating rate debt. Of the fixed rate debt, $225 million is fixed through 2024, $500 million is fixed through 2026, and $1.3 billion is fixed through 2029. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and New Credit Facility, refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Liquidity and Financing Arrangements” earlier in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2021 was approximately 101% of its book value. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates related to our variable interest rate debt would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the consolidated statements of income (loss) and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately $32 million.

Equity Price Risk
We have certain employee compensation arrangements, including deferred compensation and cash-settled share-based units granted under our long-term incentive plan, that are valued based on the Tenneco Inc. stock price. The share equivalents outstanding related to deferred compensation and cash-settled share-based awards are as follows:

-------------------------------------- ----------- ---------
 December 31
 2021 2020
Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) 1,451,422 1,878,220
Performance Share Units (PSUs) 2,951,316 —
 4,402,738 1,878,220

Deferred compensation arrangements (a) — 1,125,605

(a) At December 31, 2021, there are no share equivalents outstanding that are based on the Company’s stock price. On a prospective basis, the alternative for employees to invest their deferred compensation into these arrangements no longer exists.

At December 31, 2021, a change in the Tenneco Inc. share price of 10% would cause a change to the compensation liability of approximately $2 million, and would change the cash payout of all share equivalents, once fully vested at 100%, by $5 million.

We have entered into financial instruments to mitigate the risk associated with both the vested and unvested portions of our cash-settled share-based incentive compensation awards and, prior to September 30, 2021, our deferred compensation liability. The number of common share equivalents under these agreements at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 3,100,000 and 1,700,000. These financial instruments move in the opposite direction of the compensation payouts, allowing us to mitigate the risk associated with changes in the Tenneco Inc. share price of the final cash settlement.

Effective in the third quarter of 2021, investment options based on the Company’s stock price no longer exist under the incentive deferral plan and, at December 31, 2021, there are no deferred compensation balances correlated to the Company’s stock price.

NOTE 18. LEASES We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material variable payment provisions or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense was $119 million for both fiscal 2021 and 2020. Prior to our adoption of ASC 842 in fiscal 2020, operating lease expense was $170 million for fiscal 2019. We recognized operating lease expense in cost of revenue and operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our operating lease expense is net of sublease income and includes variable lease costs, both of which are not material. Supplemental cash flow information for fiscal 2021 and 2020 related to operating leases was as follows: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---- ---- - -- (in millions) 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 116 $ 99 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $ 60 $ 52 The weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating lease liabilities as of December 3, 2021 were 8 years and 2.28%, respectively. As of December 3, 2021, the maturities of lease liabilities under operating leases were as follows: ---------------------------------- -------------------- --- (in millions) Fiscal Year Operating Leases (1) 2022 $ 108 2023 87 2024 68 2025 65 2026 60 Thereafter 216 Total lease liabilities $ 604 Less: Imputed interest 54 Present value of lease liabilities $ 550 _________________________________________ (1) Operating lease payments exclude $16 million of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. 91  ADOBE INC.

Note 9 -- Derivative Instruments During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into two foreign currency swap agreements. The objective of both agreements is to manage the risk of changes in cash flows resulting from foreign currency gains/losses realized upon remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated SCL senior notes by swapping a specified amount of Hong Kong dollars for U.S. dollars at the contractual spot rate. The terms in one of the contracts did not effectively match the terms of the related SCL senior notes; thus, it was not designated as hedging (the "Non-Hedging Swap"). The remaining contract was designated as a hedge of the cash flows related to a portion of the SCL senior notes (the "Hedging Swap," and together with the Non-Hedging Swap, the "FX Swaps"). The Non-Hedging Swap and the Hedging Swap have a total notional value of $500 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and expire in August 2023 and August 2025, respectively. The total fair value of the FX Swaps is recorded as an asset in other assets, net. The fair value of the FX Swaps was estimated using Level 2 inputs from recently reported market transactions of foreign currency exchange rates. For the Hedging Swap, the changes in fair value of the derivative were recognized as other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the foreign currency gains/losses incurred from the remeasurement of the portion of the SCL senior notes being hedged were also recognized in other comprehensive income. For the Non-Hedging Swap the changes in fair value of the derivative were recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In August 2018, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements (the "IR Swaps"), which qualified and were designated as fair value hedges, swapping fixed-rate for variable-rate interest to hedge changes in the fair value of the 2023, 2025 and 2028 SCL Senior Notes. These IR Swaps had a total not...

(6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. As discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, the 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The 27  net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adj...
