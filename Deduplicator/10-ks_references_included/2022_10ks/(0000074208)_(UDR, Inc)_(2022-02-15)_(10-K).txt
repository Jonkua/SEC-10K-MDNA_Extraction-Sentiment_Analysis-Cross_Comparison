Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this report.​In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity’s own equity. The updated standard will be effective on January 1, 2022; however, early adoption of the ASU is permitted on January 1, 2021. The Company early adopted the guidance on January 1, 2021; however, the updated standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.​In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). ASU 2020-04 contains practical expedients for reference rate reform related activities that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur. The ASU has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and the Company does not expect the ASU to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements on a prospective basis. ​Real EstateReal estate assets held for investment are carried at historical cost and consist of land, land improvements, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment and other costs incurred during their development, acquisition and redevelopment.Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to the acquisition and/or improvement of real estate assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives if the expenditures qualify as a betterment or the life of the related asset will be substantially extended beyond the original life expectancy.UDR purchases real estate investment properties and records the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair value. The primary, although not only, identifiable intangible asset associated with our portfolio is the value of existing lease agreements. When recording the acquisition of a community, we first assign fair value to the estimated intangible value of the existing lease agreements and then to the estimated value of the land, building and fixtures assuming the community is vacant. The Company estimates the intangible value of the lease agreements by determining the lost revenue associated with a hypothetical lease-up. Depreciation on the building is based on the expected useful life of the asset and the in-place leases are amortized over their remaining average contractual life. Property acquisition costs are capitalized as incurred if the acquisition does not meet the definition of a business.Quarterly or when changes in circumstances warrant, UDR will assess our real estate properties for indicators of impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on certain factors. Such factors include, among other things, operational performance, market conditions, the Company’s intent and ability to hold the related asset, as well as any significant cost overruns on development properties.​If a real estate property has indicators of impairment, we assess whether the long-lived asset’s carrying value exceeds the community’s undiscounted future cash flows, which is representative of projected net operating income (“NOI”) plus the residual value of the community. Our future cash flow estimates are based upon historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions and our estimated holding periods. If such indicators of impairment are present and the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the community, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. Our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based primarily upon unobservable inputs related to rental rates, operating costs, growth rates, discount rates, capitalization rates, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.For long-lived assets to be disposed of, impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of the asset less estimated cost to sell is less than the carrying value of the asset. Properties classified as real estate held for disposition generally represent properties that are actively marketed or contracted for sale with the closing expected to occur within the next twelve months. Real estate held for disposition is carried at the lower of cost, net of accumulated depreciation, or fair value, less the cost to sell, determined on an asset-by-asset basis. Expenditures for ordinary repair and maintenance costs on held for disposition properties are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for improvements, renovations, and replacements related to held for disposition properties are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is not recorded on real estate held for disposition.For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we did not record any impairments on our real estate properties.Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which are 30 to 55 years for buildings, 10 to 35 years for major improvements, and 3 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures, equipment, and other assets.Predevelopment, development, and redevelopment projects and related costs are capitalized and reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Total real estate owned, net of accumulated depreciation. The Company capitalizes costs directly related to the predevelopment, development, and redevelopment of a capital project, which include, but are not limited to, interest, real estate taxes, insurance, and allocated development and redevelopment overhead related to support costs for personnel working on the capital projects. We use our professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. These costs are capitalized only during the period in which activities necessary to ready an asset for its intended use are in progress and such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific activity to get the asset ready for its intended use. These costs, excluding the direct costs of development and redevelopment and capitalized interest, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $11.3 million, $12.0 million and $8.4 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, total interest capitalized was $9.7 million, $7.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. As each home in a capital project is completed and becomes available for lease-up, the Company ceases capitalization on the related portion and depreciation commences over the estimated useful life.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits with financial institutions and short-term, highly liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The majority of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks.Restricted CashRestricted cash primarily consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for real estate taxes, insurance and replacement reserves, and security deposits. Real Estate Sales Gain Recognition For sale transactions resulting in a transfer of a controlling financial interest of a property, the Company generally derecognizes the related assets and liabilities from its Consolidated Balance Sheets and records the gain or loss in the period in which the transfer of control occurs. If control of the property has not transferred to the counterparty, the criteria for derecognition are not met and the Company will continue to recognize the related assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sale transactions to entities in which the Company sells a controlling financial interest in a property but retains a noncontrolling interest are accounted for as partial sales. Partial sales resulting in a change in control are accounted for at fair value and a full gain or loss is recognized. Therefore, the Company will record a gain or loss on the partial interest sold, and the initial measurement of our retained interest will be accounted for at fair value. Sales of real estate to joint ventures or other noncontrolled investees are also accounted for at fair value and the Company will record a full gain or loss in the period the property is contributed.​To the extent that the Company acquires a controlling financial interest in a property that it previously accounted for as an equity method investment, the Company will not remeasure its previously held interest if the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition. The Company will include the carrying amount of its previously held equity method interest along with the consideration paid and transaction costs incurred in determining the amounts to allocate to the related assets and liabilities acquired on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treated as an asset acquisition, the Company will not recognize a gain or loss on consolidation of a property.​Allowance for Credit LossesThe Company accounts for allowance for credit losses under the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) impairment model for its financial assets, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other financial instruments, and presents the net amount of the financial instrument expected to be collected. The CECL impairment model excludes operating lease receivables. The CECL impairment model requires an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of an instrument, that considers forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. Based on this model, we analyze the following criteria, as applicable in developing allowances for credit losses: historical loss information, the borrower’s ability to make scheduled payments, the remaining time to maturity, the value of underlying collateral, projected future performance of the borrower and macroeconomic trends.​The Company measures credit losses of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. If the Company determines that a financial asset does not share risk characteristics with its other financial assets, the Company evaluates the financial asset for expected credit losses on an individual basis. Allowance for credit losses are recorded as a direct reduction from an asset’s amortized cost basis. Credit losses and recoveries are recorded in Interest income and other income/(expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Recoveries of financial assets previously written off are recorded when received. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded net credit recoveries of $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.​The Company has made the optional election provided by the standard not to measure allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables as the Company writes off any uncollectible accrued interest receivables in a timely manner. The Company periodically evaluates the collectability of its accrued interest receivables. A write-off is recorded when the Company concludes that all or a portion of its accrued interest receivable balance is no longer collectible.​Notes ReceivableNotes receivable relate to financing arrangements which are typically secured by real estate, real estate related projects or other assets. Certain of the loans we extend may include characteristics such as options to purchase the project within a specific time window following expected project completion. These characteristics can cause the loans to fall under the definition of a variable interest entity (“VIE”), and thus trigger consolidation consideration. We consider the facts and circumstances pertinent to each loan, including the relative amount of financing we are contributing to the overall project cost, decision making rights or control we hold, and our rights to expected residual gains or our obligations to absorb expected residual losses from the project. If we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE due to holding a controlling financial interest, the majority of decision making control, or by other means, consolidation of the VIE would be required. The Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of the borrowing entities.Additionally, we analyze each loan arrangement that involves real estate development to consider whether the loan qualifies for accounting as a loan or as an investment in a real estate development project. The Company has evaluated its real estate loans, where appropriate, for accounting treatment as loans versus real estate development projects, as required by ASC 310-10. For each loan, the Company has concluded that the characteristics and the facts and circumstances indicate that loan accounting treatment is appropriate.The following table summarizes our Notes receivable, net as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

(a) In May 2020, the Company entered into a promissory note with an unaffiliated third party with an aggregate commitment of $4.0 million, in connection with the sale of an operating community. In January 2021, the unaffiliated third party repaid the $4.0 million promissory note in full.

(b) The Company previously had a secured note with an unaffiliated third party with an aggregate commitment of $20.0 million. The note was secured by a parcel of land and related land improvements located in Alameda, California. In September 2020, the developer defaulted on the loan. As a result of the default, in April 2021, the Company took title to the property pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure. As such, the Company increased its real estate assets owned by approximately $25.0 million, the fair market value of the property on the date of the title transfer, and recorded a $0.1 million gain on extinguishment of the secured note to Interest income and other income/(expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which was based on the note’s principal balance and unpaid accrued interest of $4.9 million. (See Note 3, Real Estate Owned for further discussion.)

(c) The Company has a secured note with an unaffiliated third party with an aggregate commitment of $2.8 million, all of which has been funded. The note is secured by a to-be-developed parcel of land in Kissimmee, Florida. Interest payments are due when the loan matures in May 2022.

(d) The Company previously had a secured note with an unaffiliated third party with an aggregate commitment of $115.0 million. Interest payments were due when the loan matured. The note was secured by a first priority deed of trust on a 259 apartment home operating community in Bellevue, Washington, which was completed in 2020.

In July 2021, the Company acquired the operating community. In connection with the acquisition of this community, the note and the unpaid accrued interest were paid in full. (See Note 3, Real Estate Owned for further discussion.)
(e) The Company has a secured note with an unaffiliated third party with an aggregate commitment of $25.4 million, of which $24.2 million has been funded, including $4.6 million funded during the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest payments are due monthly. The note matures at the earliest of the following: (a) the closing of any private or public capital raising in the amount of $5.0 million or greater; (b) an acquisition; (c) acceleration in the event of default; or (d) January 2023.

In August 2021, the terms of this secured note were amended to increase the aggregate commitment from $22.0 million to $25.4 million.
The Company recognized $5.3 million, $9.1 million, and $5.5 million of interest income and zero, zero, and $8.5 million of promoted interest from notes receivable during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, none of which was related party interest. Interest income and promoted interest are included in Interest income and other income/(expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Investment in Joint Ventures and Partnerships
We use the equity method to account for investments in joint ventures and partnerships that qualify as VIEs where we are not the primary beneficiary and other entities that we do not control or where we do not own a majority of the economic interest but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Throughout these financial statements we use the term “joint venture” or “partnership” when referring to investments in entities in which we do not have a 100% ownership interest. The Company also uses the equity method when we function as the managing partner and our venture partner has substantive participating rights or where we can be replaced by our venture partner as managing partner without cause. For a joint venture or partnership accounted for under the equity method, our share of net earnings or losses is reflected as income/loss when earned/incurred and distributions are credited against our investment in the joint venture or partnership as received.
In determining whether a joint venture or partnership is a VIE, the Company considers: the form of our ownership interest and legal structure; the size of our investment; the financing structure of the entity, including necessity of subordinated debt; estimates of future cash flows; ours and our partner’s ability to participate in the decision making related to acquisitions, disposition, budgeting and financing of the entity; obligation to absorb losses and preferential returns; nature of our partner’s primary operations; and the degree, if any, of disproportionality between the economic and voting interests of the entity. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not have investments in any joint ventures or partnerships that qualify as VIEs where we were determined to be the primary beneficiary.
We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for events or changes in circumstances that indicate there may be an other-than-temporary decline in value. We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of the investment is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, the fair value of the property of the joint venture, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. The amount of loss recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. If we believe that the decline in fair value is temporary, no impairment is recorded. The aforementioned factors are taken into consideration as a whole by management in determining the valuation of our equity method investments. Should the actual results differ from management’s judgment, the valuation could be negatively affected and may result in a negative impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and generally designates these financial instruments as cash flow hedges. Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability and measured quarterly at their fair value. The changes in fair value for cash flow hedges that are deemed effective are reflected in other comprehensive income/(loss) and for non-designated derivative financial instruments in earnings. The ineffective component of cash flow hedges, if any, is recorded in earnings.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership
Interests in the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership held by limited partners are represented by OP Units and DownREIT Units, respectively. The income is allocated to holders of OP Units/DownREIT Units based upon net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of OP Units/DownREIT Units outstanding to total common shares plus OP Units/DownREIT Units outstanding during the period. Capital contributions, distributions, and profits and losses are allocated to noncontrolling interests in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreements of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership.
Limited partners of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership have the right to require such partnership to redeem all or a portion of the OP Units/DownREIT Units held by the limited partner at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash Amount (as defined in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership, as applicable), provided that such OP Units/DownREIT Units have been outstanding for at least one year, subject to certain exceptions. UDR, as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and the DownREIT Partnership may, in its sole discretion, purchase the OP Units/DownREIT Units by paying to the limited partner either the Cash Amount or the REIT Share Amount (generally one share of Common Stock of the Company for each OP Unit/DownREIT Unit), as defined in the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership or the DownREIT Partnership, as applicable. Accordingly, the Company records the OP Units/DownREIT Units outside of permanent equity and reports the OP Units/DownREIT Units at their redemption value using the Company’s stock price at each balance sheet date.
Income Taxes
Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT and the nature of the operations for the operating properties, no provision for federal income taxes has been provided for at UDR. Historically, the Company has generally incurred only state and local excise and franchise taxes. UDR has elected for certain consolidated subsidiaries to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”).
Income taxes for our TRS are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period of the enactment date. The Company’s deferred tax assets/(liabilities) are generally the result of differing depreciable lives on capitalized assets, temporary differences between book and tax basis of assets and liabilities and timing of expense recognition for certain accrued liabilities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, UDR’s net deferred tax asset/(liability) was ($0.8) million and $(3.2) million, respectively, and are recorded in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
GAAP defines a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition.
The Company recognizes and evaluates its tax positions using a two-step process. First, UDR determines whether a tax position is more likely than not (greater than 50 percent probability) to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, the Company will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
The Company invests in assets that qualify for federal investment tax credits (“ITC”) through our TRS. An ITC reduces federal income taxes payable when qualifying depreciable property is acquired. The ITC is determined as a percentage of cost of the assets. The Company accounts for ITCs under the deferral method, under which the tax benefit from the ITC is deferred and amortized as a tax benefit into Tax (provision)/benefit, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the book life of the qualifying depreciable property. The ITCs are recorded in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
UDR had no material unrecognized tax benefit, accrued interest or penalties at December 31, 2021. UDR and its subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as well as income tax of various state and local jurisdictions. The tax years 2018 through 2020 remain open to examination by tax jurisdictions to which we are subject. When applicable, UDR recognizes interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Tax (provision)/benefit, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Principles of Consolidation
The Company accounts for subsidiary partnerships, joint ventures and other similar entities in which it holds an ownership interest in accordance with the consolidation guidance. The Company first evaluates whether each entity is a VIE. Under the VIE model, the Company consolidates an entity when it has control to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Under the voting model, the Company consolidates an entity when it controls the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest.
Discontinued Operations
In accordance with GAAP, a discontinued operation represents (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale in a single transaction and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s financial results, or (2) an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the date of acquisition. A strategic shift could include a disposal of (1) a separate major line of business, (2) a separate major geographic area of operations, (3) a major equity method investment, or (4) other major parts of an entity.
We record sales of real estate that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation in Gain/(loss) on sale of real estate owned on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Stock-Based Employee Compensation Plans
The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the award’s fair value on the grant date and recognizes the cost as stock-based compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which is generally the vesting period. For performance based awards, the Company remeasures the fair value based on the estimated achievement of the performance criteria each balance sheet date with adjustments made on a cumulative basis until the award is settled and the final compensation is known. Stock-based compensation expense is only recognized for performance based awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved. Stock-based compensation expense associated with awards is updated for actual forfeitures. The fair value for market based awards issued by the Company is calculated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation and the fair value for stock options issued by the Company is calculated utilizing the Black-Scholes-Merton formula. For further discussion, see Note 10, Employee Benefit Plans.
Advertising Costs
All advertising costs are expensed as incurred and reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within the line item Property operating and maintenance. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, total advertising expense was $8.3 million, $7.9 million, and $6.5 million, respectively.
Cost of Raising Capital
Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of equity securities are deducted from stockholders’ equity. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance or renewal of debt are recorded based on the terms of the debt issuance or renewal. Accordingly, if the terms of the renewed or modified debt instrument are deemed to be substantially different (i.e. a 10 percent or greater difference in the cash flows between instruments), all unamortized financing costs associated with the extinguished debt are charged to earnings in the current period and certain costs of new debt issuances are capitalized and amortized over the term of the debt. When the cash flows are not substantially different, the lender costs associated with the renewal or modification are capitalized and amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt instrument and other related costs are expensed. The balance of any unamortized financing costs
associated with retired debt is expensed upon retirement. Deferred financing costs for new debt instruments include fees and costs incurred by the Company to obtain financing. Deferred financing costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over a period not to exceed the term of the related debt.
Comprehensive Income/(Loss)
Comprehensive income/(loss), which is defined as the change in equity during each period from transactions and other events and circumstances from nonowner sources, including all changes in equity during a period except for those resulting from investments by or distributions to stockholders, is displayed in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income/(Loss). For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company’s other comprehensive income/(loss) consisted of the gain/(loss) (effective portion) on derivative instruments that are designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges, (gain)/loss on derivative instruments reclassified from other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings, and the allocation of other comprehensive income/(loss) to noncontrolling interests. The (gain)/loss on derivative instruments reclassified from other comprehensive income/(loss) is included in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 14, Derivatives and Hedging Activity, for further discussion. The allocation of other comprehensive income/(loss) to redeemable noncontrolling interests during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $0.4 million, $0.1 million, and $(0.8) million, respectively.
Forward Sales Agreements
​
The Company utilizes forward sales agreements for the future issuance of its common stock. When the Company enters into a forward sales agreement, the contract requires the Company to sell its shares to a counterparty at a predetermined price at a future date. The net sales price and proceeds attained by the Company will be determined on the dates of settlement, with adjustments during the term of the contract for the Company’s anticipated dividends as well as for a daily interest factor that varies with changes in the federal funds rate. The Company generally has the ability to determine the dates and method of settlement (i.e., gross physical settlement, net share settlement or cash settlement), subject to certain conditions and the right of the counterparty to accelerate settlement under certain circumstances.
​
The Company accounts for the shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon settlement as equity in accordance with ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity's Own Equity, which permits equity classification when a contract is considered indexed to the entity’s own stock and the contract requires or permits the issuing entity to settle the contract in shares (either physically or net in shares).
​
The guidance establishes a two-step process for evaluating whether an equity-linked financial instrument is considered indexed to the entity’s own stock, first, evaluating the instrument’s contingent exercise provisions and second, evaluating the instrument’s settlement provisions. When entering into forward sales agreements, we determined that (i) none of the agreement’s exercise contingencies are based on observable markets or indices besides those related to the market for our own stock price; and (ii) none of the settlement provisions preclude the agreements from being indexed to our own stock.
​
Before the issuance of shares of common stock, upon physical or net share settlement of the forward sales agreements, the Company expects that the shares issuable upon settlement of the forward sales agreements will be reflected in its diluted income/(loss) per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of common stock used in calculating diluted income/(loss) per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon full physical settlement of the forward sales agreements over the number of shares of common stock that could be purchased by the Company in the open market (based on the average market price during the period) using the proceeds receivable upon full physical settlement (based on the adjusted forward sale price at the end of the reporting period). When the Company physically or net share settles any forward sales agreement, the delivery of shares of common stock would result in an increase in the number of weighted average common shares outstanding and dilution to basic income/(loss) per share. (See Note 8, Income/(Loss) per Share for further discussion.)
​
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
​
The Company continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business. The extent of the pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and intensity of the pandemic, the timing and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, the duration of government measures to mitigate the pandemic and the success of government rental assistance programs, all of which continue to be uncertain and difficult to predict.
​
Given the uncertainty, we cannot predict the effect on future periods, but the adverse impact that could occur on the Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material, including, but not limited to, as a result of extended or reinstated eviction moratoriums or other restrictions or limitations imposed, the operation of government rent assistance programs, additional rent deferrals, payment plans, lease concessions, waiving late payment fees, charges from potential adjustments to the carrying amount of receivables, and asset impairment charges.
​
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company performed an analysis in accordance with the ASC 842, Leases, guidance to assess the collectibility of its operating lease receivables in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis included an assessment of collectibility of current and future rents and whether those lease payments were no longer probable of collection. In accordance with the leases guidance, if lease payments are no longer deemed to be probable over the life of the lease contract, we recognize revenue only when cash is received, and all existing contractual operating lease receivables and straight-line lease receivables are reserved.
​
As a result of its analysis, the Company reduced its reserve to approximately $13.2 million for multifamily tenant lease receivables and increased its reserve to approximately $6.1 million for retail tenant lease receivables (inclusive of $4.0 million of reserves on straight-line lease receivables) for its wholly-owned communities and communities held by joint ventures. In aggregate, the reduction in reserve is reflected as a $0.1 million increase to Rental income and a $0.1 million increase to Income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reserved approximately $13.5 million of multifamily tenant lease receivables and approximately $6.0 million of retail tenant lease receivables (inclusive of $3.3 million of reserves on straight-line lease receivables) for its wholly-owned communities and communities held by joint ventures. In aggregate, the reserve is reflected as a $18.4 million reduction to Rental income and a $1.1 million reduction to Income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The impact to deferred leasing commissions was not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million on its investment in equity securities of a non-core investment. The Company did not recognize any other adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets or asset impairment charges due to the COVID-19 pandemic for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
​
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those estimates.
Market Concentration Risk
The Company is subject to increased exposure from economic and other competitive factors specific to markets where the Company holds a significant percentage of the carrying value of its real estate portfolio. At December 31, 2021, the Company held greater than 10% of the carrying value of its real estate portfolio in each of the Metropolitan D.C., Boston, Massachusetts and New York, New York markets.

The Company had previously accounted for its 49% ownership interest as a preferred equity investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 5, Joint Ventures and Partnerships). The Company accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increased its real estate assets owned by approximately $67.8 million and recorded approximately $1.7 million of in-place lease intangibles.
​
In August 2020, the Company acquired a to-be-developed parcel of land located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, for approximately $16.2 million.

Dispositions
In February 2021, the Company sold an operating community located in Anaheim, California, with a total of 386 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $156.0 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $50.8 million.
​

​
In May 2020, the Company sold an operating community located in Bellevue, Washington, with a total of 71 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $49.7 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $29.6 million. The sale was partially financed by the Company through the issuance of a promissory note totaling $4.0 million which was repaid in January 2021. (See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion.) The proceeds were designated for a tax-deferred Section 1031 exchange that were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for an acquisition of an operating community in Tampa, Florida, in January 2020.
In May 2020, the Company sold an operating community located in Kirkland, Washington, with a total of 196 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $92.9 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $31.7 million.
​
In October 2020, the Company sold an operating community located in Alexandria, Virginia, with a total of 332 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $145.0 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $58.0 million.

​
In June 2019, the Company sold a parcel of land located in Los Angeles, California, for $38.0 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $5.3 million. Prior to the sale, the parcel of land was subject to a ground lease, under which UDR was the lessor, scheduled to expire in 2065. The ground lease included a purchase option for the lessee to acquire the land during specific periods of the ground lease term. During the second quarter of 2019, the lessee exercised the purchase option resulting in this sale by the Company and the ground lease being terminated.
Prior to the sale, the purchase option was not deemed to be a bargain purchase option. This ground lease existed as of the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance on January 1, 2019 and we did not reassess lease classification per the practical expedient provided by the standard. As a result, this ground lease continued to be classified as an operating lease and the land parcel subject to the ground lease continued to be recognized in Real estate held for investment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale in June 2019.
​
Developments
At December 31, 2021, the Company was developing five wholly-owned communities totaling 1,417 homes, none of which have been completed, in which we have an investment of $388.6 million. The communities are estimated to be completed between the second quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023.
Other Activity
In connection with the acquisition of certain properties, the Company agreed to pay certain of the tax liabilities of certain contributors if the Company sells one or more of the properties contributed in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of specified periods of time following the acquisition. The Company may, however, sell, without being required to pay any tax liabilities, any of such properties in a non-taxable transaction, including, but not limited to, a tax deferred Section 1031 exchange.
Further, the Company has agreed to maintain certain debt that may be guaranteed by certain contributors for specified periods of time following the acquisition. The Company, however, has the ability to refinance or repay guaranteed debt or to substitute new debt if the debt and the guaranty continue to satisfy certain conditions.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 4. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESThe Company has determined that the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership are VIEs as the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Company has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidates, the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership based on its role as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership. The Company’s role as community manager and its equity interests give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or the right to receive potentially significant benefits of the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership.

JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS
JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS 5. JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPSUDR has entered into joint ventures and partnerships with unrelated third parties to own, operate, acquire, renovate, develop, redevelop, dispose of, and manage real estate assets that are either consolidated and included in Real estate owned on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and are included in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company consolidates the entities that we control as well as any variable interest entity where we are the primary beneficiary. Under the VIE model, the Company consolidates an entity when it has control to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Under the voting model, the Company consolidates an entity when it controls the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest.UDR’s joint ventures and partnerships are funded with a combination of debt and equity. Our losses are typically limited to our investment and except as noted below, the Company does not guarantee any debt, capital payout or other obligations associated with our joint ventures and partnerships.The Company recognizes earnings or losses from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships consisting of our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint ventures and partnerships. In addition, we may earn fees for providing management services to the communities held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships.The following table summarizes the Company’s investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, net, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

(b) In January 2021, the joint venture sold its remaining community, a 293 home operating community located in Los Angeles, California, for a sales price of approximately $121.0 million. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on

the sale of approximately $2.5 million, which is included in Income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

(c) The Developer Capital Program is the program through which the Company makes investments, including preferred equity investments, mezzanine loans or other structured investments that may receive a fixed yield on the investment and may include provisions pursuant to which the Company participates in the increase in value of the property upon monetization of the applicable property and/or holds fixed price purchase options.

(d) Represents UDR’s maximum funding commitment only and therefore excludes other activity such as income from investments.

(e) In April 2021, the investment balance was paid down by $12.5 million and the Company’s preferred return increased to 12.25%.

In January 2022, the joint venture sold its community, a 313 home operating community located in Nashville, Tennessee, for a sales price of approximately $294.0 million. The Company received cash of $74.1 million, consisting of its investment and contractually accrued preferred return of $62.4 million and $11.7 million of variable participation on the sale of the community.
(f) The Company’s preferred equity investment receives a variable percentage of the value created from the project upon a capital or liquidating event.

(g) In October 2021, the Company acquired its joint venture partner’s common equity interest in a 330 apartment home operating community located in Orlando, Florida, for a purchase price of approximately $47.9 million. As a result, in October 2021, the Company consolidated the operating community and it is no longer accounted for as a preferred equity investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 3, Real Estate Owned).

(h) In January 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with an unaffiliated joint venture partner to develop and operate a 356 apartment home community in Herndon, Virginia. The Company’s preferred equity investment of $30.2 million earns a preferred return of 9.0% per annum and receives a variable percentage of the value created from the project upon a capital or liquidating event. The unaffiliated joint venture partner is the managing member of the joint venture and the developer of the community. The Company has concluded that it does not control the joint venture and accounts for it under the equity method of accounting.

(i) In March 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with an unaffiliated joint venture partner to develop and operate a 469 apartment home community in Allen, Texas. The Company’s preferred equity investment of $19.8 million earns a preferred return of 9.0% per annum and receives a variable percentage of the value created from the project upon a capital or liquidating event. The unaffiliated joint venture partner is the managing member of the joint venture and the developer of the community. The Company has concluded that it does not control the joint venture and accounts for it under the equity method of accounting.

(j) In May 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with an unaffiliated joint venture partner to develop and operate a 384 apartment home community in Kissimmee, Florida. The Company’s preferred equity investment of $16.0 million earns a preferred return of 14.0% per annum. The unaffiliated joint venture partner is the managing member of the joint venture and the developer of the community. The Company has concluded that it does not control the joint venture and accounts for it under the equity method of accounting.

(k) In December 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with an unaffiliated joint venture partner. The purpose of the joint venture is to make a preferred equity investment in a project to develop and operate a 689 apartment home community in Washington D.C. The Company’s share of the preferred equity investment of $52.2 million earns a preferred return of 9.7% per annum. The unaffiliated joint venture partner is the managing member of the joint venture. The Company has concluded that it does not control the joint venture and accounts for it under the equity method of accounting.

(l) The Company recognized approximately $50.8 million of investment income from RETV I for the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily related to unrealized gains from one portfolio investment held by RETV I, SmartRent, Inc. (“SmartRent”). In 2021, SmartRent, a provider of smart home automation solutions, went public through a merger with a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”). As a result, SmartRent began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “SMRT.” Due to the merger, all shares of SmartRent that RETV I held were converted to publicly traded SmartRent shares based on a pre-determined

conversion factor. Following the merger and stock conversion, RETV I began recording its investment in SmartRent based on the share price at the end of the reporting period less an illiquidity discount based upon a lock-up restriction on selling or transferring the investment for a period of time.

​
In January 2022, the Company entered into a real estate technology investment as a limited partner, for a total commitment of $25.0 million. The Company funded $7.5 million to the limited partnership at closing. The Company has concluded that it does not control the limited partnership and accounts for it under the equity method of accounting.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had deferred fees of $8.7 million and $8.4 million, respectively, which will be recognized through earnings over the weighted average life of the related properties, upon the disposition of the properties to a third party, or upon completion of certain development obligations.
The Company recognized management fees of $6.1 million, $5.1 million, and $14.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, for management of the communities held by the joint ventures and partnerships. The management fees are included in Joint venture management and other fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company may, in the future, make additional capital contributions to certain of our joint ventures and partnerships should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund acquisitions or operations.
We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our Investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. Based on the significance of the unobservable inputs, we classify these fair value measurements within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company did not incur any other-than-temporary impairments in the value of its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.
Condensed summary financial information relating to the unconsolidated joint ventures’ and partnerships’ operations (not just our proportionate share), is presented below for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (dollars in thousands):

(a) Represent the gains on the sale of three operating communities at the UDR/KFH joint venture level.

(b) Represent the net gains on the revaluation of the assets and liabilities to fair value of 15 operating communities at the UDR/MetLife II joint venture level and one development community and four land parcels at the UDR/MetLife Vitruvian Park® joint venture level prior to their distribution to the Company or MetLife in November 2019. The net gain on revaluation of assets and liabilities to fair value was recognized at the joint venture level as the respective joint ventures distributed their equity interests in the real estate to the Company or MetLife at fair value.

For the approximately 50% ownership interest acquired in the 10 operating communities, one development community and four land parcels described above, the Company deferred its share of the net gain on revaluation of approximately $131.5 million and recorded it as a reduction of the carrying amount of real estate owned. (see Note 3, Real Estate Owned). For the 50% ownership interest acquired in the five communities by MetLife, the Company recognized a net gain on sale of $114.9 million at our share, when the communities were disposed of by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture.

LEASES
LEASES 6. LEASESLessee - Ground and Office LeasesUDR owns six communities that are subject to ground leases, under which UDR is the lessee, expiring between 2043 and 2103, inclusive of extension options we are reasonably certain will be exercised. All of these leases are classified as operating leases through the lease term expiration based on our election of the practical expedient provided by the leasing standard. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. We currently do not hold any finance leases. The Company also elected the short-term lease exception provided by the leasing standard and therefore only recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. No leases qualified for the short-term lease exception during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Operating lease right-of-use assets were $197.5 million and $200.9 million, respectively, and the Operating lease liabilities were $192.5 million and $195.6 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet related to our ground leases. The value of the Operating lease right-of-use assets exceeds the value of the Operating lease liabilities due to prepaid lease payments and intangible assets for ground leases acquired in the purchase of real estate. The calculation of these amounts includes minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term (described further in the table below). Variable lease payments are excluded from the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in earnings in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.As the discount rate implicit in the leases was not readily determinable, we determined the discount rate for these leases utilizing the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at a portfolio level, adjusted for the remaining lease term, and the form of underlying collateral. The weighted average remaining lease term for these leases was 43.2 years and 43.9 years at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the weighted average discount rate was 5.0% at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.Future minimum lease payments and total operating lease liabilities from our ground leases as of December 31, 2021 are as follows (dollars in thousands):​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ Ground Leases
 2022 ​ $ 12,442
 2023 ​ ​ 12,442
 2024 ​ ​ 12,442
 2025 ​ ​ 12,442
 2026 ​ ​ 12,442
Thereafter ​ ​ 430,337
Total future minimum lease payments (undiscounted) ​ ​ 492,547
Difference between future undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows ​ ​ (300,059)
Total operating lease liabilities (discounted) ​ $ 192,488

​
For purposes of recognizing our ground lease contracts, the Company uses the minimum lease payments, if stated in the agreement. For ground lease agreements where there is a rent reset provision based on a change in an index or a rate (i.e., changes in fair market rental rates or changes in the consumer price index) but that does not include a specified minimum lease payment, the Company uses the current rent over the remainder of the lease term. If there is a contingency upon which some or all of the variable lease payments that will be paid over the remainder of the lease term are based, which is resolved such that those payments now meet the definition of lease payments, the Company will remeasure the right-of-use asset and lease liability on the reset date.
The components of operating lease expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):

Lessor - Apartment Home, Retail and Commercial Space Leases
​
UDR’s communities and retail and commercial space are leased to tenants under operating leases. As of December 31, 2021, our apartment home leases generally have initial terms of 12 months or less and represent approximately 99.1% of our total lease revenue. As of December 31, 2021, our retail and commercial space leases generally have initial terms of between 5 and 15 years and represent approximately 0.9% of our total lease revenue. Our apartment home leases are generally renewable at the end of the lease term, subject to potential increases in rental rates, and our retail and commercial space leases generally have renewal options, subject to associated increases in rental rates due to market-based or fixed-price renewal options and certain other conditions. (See Note 16, Reportable Segments for further discussion around our major revenue streams and disaggregation of our revenue.)
​
Future minimum lease payments from our retail and commercial leases as of December 31, 2021 are as follows (dollars in thousands):

The amounts shown in the table above do not include these variable percentage rents. The Company recorded variable percentage rents of $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

​
For purposes of classification of the above table, variable rate debt with a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is deemed as fixed rate debt due to the Company having effectively established a fixed interest rate for the underlying debt instrument.
Our secured debt instruments generally feature either monthly interest and principal or monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. As of December 31, 2021, secured debt encumbered approximately 12% of UDR’s total real estate owned based upon gross book value (approximately 88% of UDR’s real estate owned based on gross book value is unencumbered).
(a) At December 31, 2021, fixed rate mortgage notes payable are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest and mature at various dates from July 2024 through February 2031 and carry interest rates ranging from 2.62% to 4.39%.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company assumed three fixed rate mortgage notes payable with an aggregate outstanding balance of $183.3 million and a fair value of $201.3 million in connection with the acquisition of three operating properties, which carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.93%. (see Note 3, Real Estate Owned).
​
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company prepaid zero and $111.1 million, respectively, of its fixed rate mortgage notes payable with proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured medium-term notes. The Company incurred net extinguishment costs of zero, $8.5 million and zero during years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, which was included in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
​
The Company will from time to time acquire properties subject to fixed rate debt instruments. In those situations, the Company records the debt at its estimated fair value and amortizes any difference between the fair value and par value to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument.
(b) During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company had $3.9 million, $22.4 million, and $3.0 million, respectively, of amortization of the fair market adjustment of debt assumed in the acquisition of properties inclusive of its fixed rate mortgage notes payable and credit facilities, which was included in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The unamortized fair market adjustment was a net premium of $27.0 million and $12.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
​
 (c) The variable rate mortgage note payable secures a tax-exempt housing bond issue that matures in March 2032. Interest on this note is payable in monthly installments. As of December 31, 2021, the variable interest rate on the mortgage note was 0.71%.
(d) In September 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $350.0 million unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”). The Credit Agreement allows the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the total borrowings under the Term Loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or more lenders. The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 31, 2026, with two six-month extension options, subject to certain conditions. The Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of January 31, 2027.
The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s prior credit agreement, which provided for: (i) a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in January 2023 and (ii) a $350.0 million term loan scheduled to mature in September 2023. The prior credit agreement allowed the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and total borrowings under the term loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to $2.0 billion, subject to certain conditions.
​
Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the Revolving Credit Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 77.5 basis points and a facility fee of 15 basis points, and the Term Loan has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 85 basis points. Depending on the Company’s credit rating, the margin under the Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 70 to 140 basis points, the facility fee ranges from 10 to 30 basis points, and the margin under the Term Loan ranges from 75 to 160 basis points.
In November 2020, the Company entered into three interest rate swaps, which became effective in January 2021, to hedge against interest rate risk on the Term Loan until July 2022. The all-in weighted average interest rate, inclusive of the impact of the interest rate swaps, was 1.02%. In August 2021, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps totaling a $175.0 million notional value, which will become effective in July 2022, to hedge against interest rate risk on the Term Loan until July 2025. The all-in weighted average interest rate, inclusive of the impact of the interest rate swaps will be 1.48%.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and financial and other affirmative and negative covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, in certain cases subject to customary periods to cure. The occurrence of an event of default, following the applicable cure period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the unpaid principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable.

(e) The Company has an unsecured commercial paper program. Under the terms of the program, the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $700.0 million. The notes are sold under customary terms in the United States commercial paper market and rank pari passu with all of the Company’s other unsecured indebtedness. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.
In July 2021, the maximum aggregate amount was increased from $500.0 million to $700.0 million.

 (f) The Company has a working capital credit facility, which provides for a $75.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Working Capital Credit Facility”) with a scheduled maturity date of January 12, 2024. In September 2021, the Company amended the Working Capital Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from January 14, 2022 to January 12, 2024 and lower the margin range for the interest rate. Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the Working Capital Credit Facility now has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 77.5 basis points. Depending on the Company’s credit rating, the margin ranges from 70 to 140 basis points.

Dec. 31, 2021
INCOME/(LOSS) PER SHARE
INCOME/(LOSS) PER SHARE 8. INCOME/(LOSS) PER SHAREThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income/(loss) per share for the periods presented (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data):​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ Year Ended December 31,
​ 2021 2020 2019
Numerator for income/(loss) per share: ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Net income/(loss) ​ $ 160,993 ​ $ 68,970 ​ $ 199,579
Net (income)/loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership ​ (10,873) ​ (4,543) ​ (14,426)

​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
Denominator for income/(loss) per share: ​ ​ ​
Weighted average common shares outstanding ​ 300,579 ​ 294,808 ​ 285,509
Non-vested restricted stock awards ​ (253) ​ (263) ​ (262)
Denominator for basic income/(loss) per share ​ 300,326 ​ 294,545 ​ 285,247

Income/(loss) per weighted average common share: ​ ​ ​
Basic ​ $ 0.49 ​ $ 0.20 ​ $ 0.63
Diluted ​ $ 0.48 ​ $ 0.20 ​ $ 0.63

​
Basic income/(loss) per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income/(loss) per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the common shares issuable from the assumed conversion of the OP Units and DownREIT Units, convertible preferred stock, stock options, unvested long-term incentive plan units (“LTIP Units”), unvested restricted stock and continuous equity program forward sales agreements. Only those instruments having a dilutive impact on our basic income/(loss) per share are included in diluted income/(loss) per share during the periods. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the effect of the conversion of the OP Units, DownREIT Units and the Company’s Series E preferred stock was not dilutive and therefore not included in the above calculation.
In July 2021, the Company entered into an ATM sales agreement under which the Company may offer and sell up to 20.0 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, to or through its sales agents and may enter into separate forward sales agreements to or through its forward purchasers. Upon entering into the ATM sales agreement, the Company simultaneously terminated the sales agreement for its prior at-the-market equity offering program, which was entered into in July 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold 1.6 million shares of common stock through its ATM program pursuant to the Company’s forward sales agreement described below. As of December 31, 2021, we had 18.4 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under the ATM program, including an aggregate of 4.4 million shares subject to the forward sales agreements described below.
In connection with any forward sales agreement under the Company’s ATM program, the relevant forward purchasers will borrow from third parties and, through the relevant sales agent, acting in its role as forward seller, sell a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of shares underlying the agreement. The Company does not initially receive any proceeds from any sale of borrowed shares by the forward seller.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had entered into forward sales agreements under its current or prior ATM programs for a total of 10.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average initial forward price per share of $50.59, of which 4.4 million shares had not been settled. The actual forward price per share to be received by the Company upon settlement will be determined on the applicable settlement date based on adjustments made to the initial forward price to reflect the then-current federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock over the term of the forward sales agreement. As of December 31, 2021, 6.4 million shares under
the forward sales agreements under the ATM programs had been settled at a weighted average forward price per share of $47.79, which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate, the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock and commissions paid to sales agents of approximately $2.6 million, for net proceeds of $306.6 million. The final dates by which the remaining shares sold under the forward sales agreements under the ATM programs must be settled range between August 1, 2022 and September 14, 2022.
​
In March 2021, the Company entered into forward sale agreements to sell 7.0 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward price per share of $43.51. The actual forward price per share to be received by the Company upon settlement was determined on the applicable settlement date based on adjustments made to the initial forward price to reflect the then-current federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock over the term of the forward sales agreement. In September 2021, the Company settled all 7.0 million shares at a forward price per share of $42.65, which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate, the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock and commissions paid to sales agents of approximately $6.0 million, for net proceeds of $298.5 million.
​
In June 2021, the Company entered into forward sale agreements to sell 6.1 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward price per share of $49.22. The actual forward price per share to be received by the Company upon settlement will be determined on the applicable settlement date based on adjustments made to the initial forward price to reflect the then-current federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock over the term of the forward sales agreement. In December 2021, the Company settled all 6.1 million shares at a forward price per share of $48.33, which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate, the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock and commissions paid to sales agents of approximately $5.4 million, for net proceeds of $294.8 million.
​
As described above, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company settled 19.5 million shares in aggregate under forward sales agreements under the ATM programs and previously announced forward sales agreements for net proceeds of $900.0 million. Aggregate net proceeds from such forward sales, after deducting related expenses, were $899.1 million.
​
As of February 11, 2022, we had 18.4 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under the ATM program, including an aggregate of 4.4 million shares subject to the forward sales agreements.
The Company generally has the ability to determine the dates and method of settlement (i.e., gross physical settlement, net share settlement or cash settlement), subject to certain conditions and the right of the counterparty to accelerate settlement under certain circumstances. The Company currently expects to fully physically settle each forward sales agreement with the relevant forward purchaser on one or more dates specified by the Company on or prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sales agreement, in which case the Company expects to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward sales agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may also elect, in its discretion, to cash settle or net share settle a particular forward sales agreement, in which case the Company may not receive any proceeds (in the case of cash settlement) or will not receive any proceeds (in the case of net share settlement), and the Company may owe cash (in the case of cash settlement) or shares of UDR common stock (in the case of net share settlement) to the relevant forward purchaser.
​
​
The following table sets forth the additional shares of common stock outstanding by equity instrument if converted to common stock for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

Common Stock
In July 2021, the Company entered into an ATM sales agreement under which the Company may offer and sell up to 20.0 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, to or through its sales agents and may enter into separate forward sales agreements to or through its forward purchasers. Upon entering into the ATM sales agreement, the Company simultaneously terminated the sales agreement for its prior at-the-market equity offering program, which was entered into in July 2017. As of December 31, 2021, 18.4 million shares were available for sale under the ATM program, including an aggregate of 4.4 million shares subject to forward sales agreements.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into the following equity transactions for our common stock:
● Settled 19.5 million shares in aggregate under forward sales agreements under the ATM programs and previously announced forward sales agreements at a weighted average forward price per share of $46.11, for net proceeds of approximately $900.0 million. Aggregate net proceeds from such forward sales, after deducting related expenses, were $899.1 million;

● Issued 0.1 million shares, net of forfeitures, of common stock through the Company’s 1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”); and

● Issued 1.9 million shares of common stock upon redemption of DownREIT Units, resulting in the forfeiture of 1.9 million Series F Preferred shares.

Distributions are subject to the approval of the Board of Directors and are dependent upon our strategy, financial condition and operating results. UDR’s common distributions for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 totaled $1.45, $1.44, and $1.37 per share, respectively.
Preferred Stock
The Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series E”) has no stated par value and a liquidation preference of $16.61 per share. Subject to certain adjustments and conditions, each share of the Series E is convertible at any time at the holder’s option into one share of our common stock prior to a “Special Dividend” declared in 2008 (1.083 shares after the Special Dividend). The holders of the Series E are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis as a single class in combination with the holders of common stock at any meeting of our stockholders for the election of directors or for any other purpose on which the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. The Series E has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or any mandatory redemption.
Distributions declared on the Series E for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $1.57, $1.56, and $1.48 per share, respectively. The Series E is not listed on any exchange. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, a total of 2.7 million and 2.7 million, respectively, shares of the Series E were outstanding.
UDR is authorized to issue up to 20.0 million shares of the Series F Preferred Stock (“Series F”). The Series F may be purchased by holders of OP Units and DownREIT Units, at a purchase price of $0.0001 per share. OP/DownREIT Unitholders are entitled to subscribe for and purchase one share of UDR’s Series F for each OP/DownREIT Unit held. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, 1.9 million and 0.3 million of the Series F shares were forfeited upon the conversion of OP Units and DownREIT Units into Company common stock, respectively.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, a total of 12.6 million and 14.4 million shares, respectively, of the Series F were outstanding with an aggregate purchase value of $1,258 and $1,444, respectively. Holders of the Series F are entitled to one vote for each share of the Series F they hold, voting together with the holders of our common stock, on each matter submitted to a vote of security holders at a meeting of our stockholders. The Series F does not entitle its holders to dividends or any other rights, privileges or preferences.
Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan
UDR’s Distribution Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”) allows common and preferred stockholders the opportunity to purchase, through the reinvestment of cash dividends and by making additional cash payments, additional shares of UDR’s common stock. From inception through December 31, 2008, shareholders have elected to utilize the Stock Purchase Plan to reinvest their distribution for the equivalent of 10.0 million shares of Company common stock. Shares in the amount of 11.0 million were reserved for issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, UDR acquired all shares issued through the open market.

INCOME TAXES Income before income taxes for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following: -------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - ----- (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Domestic $ 1,736 $ 1,090 $ 438 Foreign 3,969 3,086 2,767 Income before income taxes $ 5,705 $ 4,176 $ 3,205 The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following: ----------------------------------------- ----- --- ---- ------- ---- ------- ---- - --- (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Current: United States federal $ 391 $ 119 $ 7 Foreign 197 222 211 State and local 103 79 31 Total current 691 420 249 Deferred: United States federal (148) (123) 23 Foreign 359 (1,313) (12) State and local (19) (68) (6) Total deferred 192 (1,504) 5 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 883 $ (1,084) $ 254 Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights ("IP rights") During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. 80  ADOBE INC.

Note 8. Acquisitions Fitbit In January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, a leading wearables brand for $2.1 billion. The addition of Fitbit to Google Services is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value. The purchase price excludes post acquisition compensation arrangements. The purchase price was attributed to $440 million cash acquired, $590 million of intangible assets, $1.2 billion of goodwill and $92 million of net liabilities assumed. Goodwill was recorded in the Google Services segment and primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Other Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $885 million, net of cash acquired, of which the total amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $118 million. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. 74 ----------------- -------------  Alphabet Inc.

Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $202 million, $176 million and $154 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have direct...

['s Own Equity, which permits equity classification when a contract is considered indexed to the entity’s own stock and the contract requires or permits the issuing entity to settle the contract in shares (either physically or net in shares).
​
The guidance establishes a two-step process for evaluating whether an equity-linked financial instrument is considered indexed to the entity’s own stock, first, evaluating the instrument’s contingent exercise provisions and second, evaluating the instrument’s settlement provisions. When entering into forward sales agreements, we determined that (i) none of the agreement’s exercise contingencies are based on observable markets or indices besides those related to the market for our own stock price; and (ii) none of the settlement provisions preclude the agreements from being indexed to our own stock.
​
Before the issuance of shares of common stock, upon physical or net share settlement of the forward sales agreements, the Company expects that the shares issuable upon settlement of the forward sales agreements will be reflected in its diluted income/(loss) per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of common stock used in calculating diluted income/(loss) per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon full physical settlement of the forward sales agreements over the number of shares of common stock that could be purchased by the Company in the open market (based on the average market price during the period) using the proceeds receivable upon full physical settlement (based on the adjusted forward sale price at the end of the reporting period). When the Company physically or net share settles any forward sales agreement, the delivery of shares of common stock would result in an increase in the number of weighted average common shares outstanding and dilution to basic income/(loss) per share. (See Note 8, Income/(Loss) per Share for further discussion.)
​
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
​
The Company continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business. The extent of the pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and intensity of the pandemic, the timing and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, the duration of government measures to mitigate the pandemic and the success of government rental assistance programs, all of which continue to be uncertain and difficult to predict.
​
Given the uncertainty, we cannot predict the effect on future periods, but the adverse impact that could occur on the Company’s future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material, including, but not limited to, as a result of extended or reinstated eviction moratoriums or other restrictions or limitations imposed, the operation of government rent assistance programs, additional rent deferrals, payment plans, lease concessions, waiving late payment fees, charges from potential adjustments to the carrying amount of receivables, and asset impairment charges.
​
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company performed an analysis in accordance with the ASC 842, Leases, guidance to assess the collectibility of its operating lease receivables in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis included an assessment of collectibility of current and future rents and whether those lease payments were no longer probable of collection. In accordance with the leases guidance, if lease payments are no longer deemed to be probable over the life of the lease contract, we recognize revenue only when cash is received, and all existing contractual operating lease receivables and straight-line lease receivables are reserved.
​
As a result of its analysis, the Company reduced its reserve to approximately $13.2 million for multifamily tenant lease receivables and increased its reserve to approximately $6.1 million for retail tenant lease receivables (inclusive of $4.0 million of reserves on straight-line lease receivables) for its wholly-owned communities and communities held by joint ventures. In aggregate, the reduction in reserve is reflected as a $0.1 million increase to Rental income and a $0.1 million increase to Income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reserved approximately $13.5 million of multifamily tenant lease receivables and approximately $6.0 million of retail tenant lease receivables (inclusive of $3.3 million of reserves on straight-line lease receivables) for its wholly-owned communities and communities held by joint ventures. In aggregate, the reserve is reflected as a $18.4 million reduction to Rental income and a $1.1 million reduction to Income/(loss) from unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. The impact to deferred leasing commissions was not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.1 million on its investment in equity securities of a non-core investment. The Company did not recognize any other adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets or asset impairment charges due to the COVID-19 pandemic for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
​
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual amounts realized or paid could differ from those estimates.
Market Concentration Risk
The Company is subject to increased exposure from economic and other competitive factors specific to markets where the Company holds a significant percentage of the carrying value of its real estate portfolio. At December 31, 2021, the Company held greater than 10% of the carrying value of its real estate portfolio in each of the Metropolitan D.C., Boston, Massachusetts and New York, New York markets.

The Company paid for the community by issuing approximately 0.9 million OP Units (valued at $53.00 per unit per the agreement) to the seller, which equaled $47.9 million. In connection with the acquisition, the joint venture construction loan of approximately $39.6 million was repaid. The Company previously held a $16.4 million preferred equity investment in the entity on the date of acquisition, which it accounted for as an unconsolidated equity investment (see Note 5, Joint Ventures and Partnerships). As a result, in October 2021, the Company increased its ownership interest to 100% and consolidated the operating community. The Company accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation. The Company increased its real estate assets owned by approximately $103.6 million and recorded $2.4 million of in-place lease intangibles.
​
In October 2021, the Company acquired a 663 apartment home operating community located in Orlando, Florida, for approximately $177.8 million. The Company increased its real estate assets owned by approximately $174.1 million and recorded and $3.7 million of in-place lease intangibles.

In January 2020, the Company increased its ownership interest from 49% to 100% in a 276 apartment home operating community located in Hillsboro, Oregon, for a cash purchase price of approximately $21.6 million. In connection with the acquisition, the Company repaid approximately $35.6 million of joint venture construction financing. As a result, the Company consolidated the operating community. The Company had previously accounted for its 49% ownership interest as a preferred equity investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 5, Joint Ventures and Partnerships). The Company accounted for the consolidation as an asset acquisition resulting in no gain or loss upon consolidation and increased its real estate assets owned by approximately $67.8 million and recorded approximately $1.7 million of in-place lease intangibles.
​
In August 2020, the Company acquired a to-be-developed parcel of land located in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, for approximately $16.2 million.
​
In November 2020, the Company acquired a 672 apartment home operating community located in Tampa, Florida, for approximately $122.5 million. The Company increased its real estate assets owned by approximately $119.4 million and recorded approximately $3.1 million of in-place lease intangibles.

​
Dispositions
In February 2021, the Company sold an operating community located in Anaheim, California, with a total of 386 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $156.0 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $50.8 million.
​
In October 2021, the Company sold an operating community located in Anaheim, California, with a total of 265 apartment homes for a sales price of $126.0 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $85.2 million.
​
In May 2020, the Company sold an operating community located in Bellevue, Washington, with a total of 71 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $49.7 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $29.6 million. The sale was partially financed by the Company through the issuance of a promissory note totaling $4.0 million which was repaid in January 2021. (See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion.) The proceeds were designated for a tax-deferred Section 1031 exchange that were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for an acquisition of an operating community in Tampa, Florida, in January 2020.
In May 2020, the Company sold an operating community located in Kirkland, Washington, with a total of 196 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $92.9 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $31.7 million.
​
In October 2020, the Company sold an operating community located in Alexandria, Virginia, with a total of 332 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $145.0 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $58.0 million.

​
In June 2019, the Company sold a parcel of land located in Los Angeles, California, for $38.0 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $5.3 million. Prior to the sale, the parcel of land was subject to a ground lease, under which UDR was the lessor, scheduled to expire in 2065. The ground lease included a purchase option for the lessee to acquire the land during specific periods of the ground lease term. During the second quarter of 2019, the lessee exercised the purchase option resulting in this sale by the Company and the ground lease being terminated.
Prior to the sale, the purchase option was not deemed to be a bargain purchase option. This ground lease existed as of the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance on January 1, 2019 and we did not reassess lease classification per the practical expedient provided by the standard. As a result, this ground lease continued to be classified as an operating lease and the land parcel subject to the ground lease continued to be recognized in Real estate held for investment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the sale in June 2019.
​
Developments
At December 31, 2021, the Company was developing five wholly-owned communities totaling 1,417 homes, none of which have been completed, in which we have an investment of $388.6 million. The communities are estimated to be completed between the second quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023.
Other Activity
In connection with the acquisition of certain properties, the Company agreed to pay certain of the tax liabilities of certain contributors if the Company sells one or more of the properties contributed in a taxable transaction prior to the expiration of specified periods of time following the acquisition. The Company may, however, sell, without being required to pay any tax liabilities, any of such properties in a non-taxable transaction, including, but not limited to, a tax deferred Section 1031 exchange.
Further, the Company has agreed to maintain certain debt that may be guaranteed by certain contributors for specified periods of time following the acquisition. The Company, however, has the ability to refinance or repay guaranteed debt or to substitute new debt if the debt and the guaranty continue to satisfy certain conditions.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 4. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESThe Company has determined that the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership are VIEs as the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. The Company has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidates, the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership based on its role as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership. The Company’s role as community manager and its equity interests give us the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance and the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses or the right to receive potentially significant benefits of the Operating Partnership and DownREIT Partnership.

Note 8. Acquisitions Fitbit In January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, a leading wearables brand for $2.1 billion. The addition of Fitbit to Google Services is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value. The purchase price excludes post acquisition compensation arrangements. The purchase price was attributed to $440 million cash acquired, $590 million of intangible assets, $1.2 billion of goodwill and $92 million of net liabilities assumed. Goodwill was recorded in the Google Services segment and primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Other Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $885 million, net of cash acquired, of which the total amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $118 million. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. 74 ----------------- -------------  Alphabet Inc.

JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS
JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS 5. JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPSUDR has entered into joint ventures and partnerships with unrelated third parties to own, operate, acquire, renovate, develop, redevelop, dispose of, and manage real estate assets that are either consolidated and included in Real estate owned on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and are included in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company consolidates the entities that we control as well as any variable interest entity where we are the primary beneficiary. Under the VIE model, the Company consolidates an entity when it has control to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Under the voting model, the Company consolidates an entity when it controls the entity through ownership of a majority voting interest.UDR’s joint ventures and partnerships are funded with a combination of debt and equity. Our losses are typically limited to our investment and except as noted below, the Company does not guarantee any debt, capital payout or other obligations associated with our joint ventures and partnerships.The Company recognizes earnings or losses from our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships consisting of our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses of the joint ventures and partnerships. In addition, we may earn fees for providing management services to the communities held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships.The following table summarizes the Company’s investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships, net, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

(d) Represents UDR’s maximum funding commitment only and therefore excludes other activity such as income from investments.

(e) In April 2021, the investment balance was paid down by $12.5 million and the Company’s preferred return increased to 12.25%.

In January 2022, the joint venture sold its community, a 313 home operating community located in Nashville, Tennessee, for a sales price of approximately $294.0 million. The Company received cash of $74.1 million, consisting of its investment and contractually accrued preferred return of $62.4 million and $11.7 million of variable participation on the sale of the community.
(f) The Company’s preferred equity investment receives a variable percentage of the value created from the project upon a capital or liquidating event.

(g) In October 2021, the Company acquired its joint venture partner’s common equity interest in a 330 apartment home operating community located in Orlando, Florida, for a purchase price of approximately $47.9 million. As a result, in October 2021, the Company consolidated the operating community and it is no longer accounted for as a preferred equity investment in an unconsolidated joint venture (see Note 3, Real Estate Owned).

(h) In January 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with an unaffiliated joint venture partner to develop and operate a 356 apartment home community in Herndon, Virginia. The Company’s preferred equity investment of $30.2 million earns a preferred return of 9.0% per annum and receives a variable percentage of the value created from the project upon a capital or liquidating event.

The unaffiliated joint venture partner is the managing member of the joint venture and the developer of the community. The Company has concluded that it does not control the joint venture and accounts for it under the equity method of accounting.

(j) In May 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with an unaffiliated joint venture partner to develop and operate a 384 apartment home community in Kissimmee, Florida. The Company’s preferred equity investment of $16.0 million earns a preferred return of 14.0% per annum.

The Company’s share of the preferred equity investment of $52.2 million earns a preferred return of 9.7% per annum. The unaffiliated joint venture partner is the managing member of the joint venture. The Company has concluded that it does not control the joint venture and accounts for it under the equity method of accounting.

(l) The Company recognized approximately $50.8 million of investment income from RETV I for the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily related to unrealized gains from one portfolio investment held by RETV I, SmartRent, Inc. (“SmartRent”). In 2021, SmartRent, a provider of smart home automation solutions, went public through a merger with a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”). As a result, SmartRent began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “SMRT.” Due to the merger, all shares of SmartRent that RETV I held were converted to publicly traded SmartRent shares based on a pre-determined

conversion factor. Following the merger and stock conversion, RETV I began recording its investment in SmartRent based on the share price at the end of the reporting period less an illiquidity discount based upon a lock-up restriction on selling or transferring the investment for a period of time.

​
In January 2022, the Company entered into a real estate technology investment as a limited partner, for a total commitment of $25.0 million. The Company funded $7.5 million to the limited partnership at closing. The Company has concluded that it does not control the limited partnership and accounts for it under the equity method of accounting.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had deferred fees of $8.7 million and $8.4 million, respectively, which will be recognized through earnings over the weighted average life of the related properties, upon the disposition of the properties to a third party, or upon completion of certain development obligations.
The Company recognized management fees of $6.1 million, $5.1 million, and $14.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, for management of the communities held by the joint ventures and partnerships. The management fees are included in Joint venture management and other fees on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company may, in the future, make additional capital contributions to certain of our joint ventures and partnerships should additional capital contributions be necessary to fund acquisitions or operations.
We consider various factors to determine if a decrease in the value of our Investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures, net is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, age of the venture, our intent and ability to retain our investment in the entity, the financial condition and long-term prospects of the entity, and the relationships with the other joint venture partners and its lenders. Based on the significance of the unobservable inputs, we classify these fair value measurements within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

(a) Represent the gains on the sale of three operating communities at the UDR/KFH joint venture level.

(b) Represent the net gains on the revaluation of the assets and liabilities to fair value of 15 operating communities at the UDR/MetLife II joint venture level and one development community and four land parcels at the UDR/MetLife Vitruvian Park® joint venture level prior to their distribution to the Company or MetLife in November 2019. The net gain on revaluation of assets and liabilities to fair value was recognized at the joint venture level as the respective joint ventures distributed their equity interests in the real estate to the Company or MetLife at fair value.

For the approximately 50% ownership interest acquired in the 10 operating communities, one development community and four land parcels described above, the Company deferred its share of the net gain on revaluation of approximately $131.5 million and recorded it as a reduction of the carrying amount of real estate owned. (see Note 3, Real Estate Owned). For the 50% ownership interest acquired in the five communities by MetLife, the Company recognized a net gain on sale of $114.9 million at our share, when the communities were disposed of by the UDR/MetLife II joint venture.

LEASES
LEASES 6. LEASESLessee - Ground and Office LeasesUDR owns six communities that are subject to ground leases, under which UDR is the lessee, expiring between 2043 and 2103, inclusive of extension options we are reasonably certain will be exercised. All of these leases are classified as operating leases through the lease term expiration based on our election of the practical expedient provided by the leasing standard. Rental expense for lease payments related to operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. We currently do not hold any finance leases. The Company also elected the short-term lease exception provided by the leasing standard and therefore only recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. No leases qualified for the short-term lease exception during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Operating lease right-of-use assets were $197.5 million and $200.9 million, respectively, and the Operating lease liabilities were $192.5 million and $195.6 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet related to our ground leases. The value of the Operating lease right-of-use assets exceeds the value of the Operating lease liabilities due to prepaid lease payments and intangible assets for ground leases acquired in the purchase of real estate. The calculation of these amounts includes minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term (described further in the table below). Variable lease payments are excluded from the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in earnings in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.As the discount rate implicit in the leases was not readily determinable, we determined the discount rate for these leases utilizing the Company’s incremental borrowing rate at a portfolio level, adjusted for the remaining lease term, and the form of underlying collateral. The weighted average remaining lease term for these leases was 43.2 years and 43.9 years at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the weighted average discount rate was 5.0% at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.Future minimum lease payments and total operating lease liabilities from our ground leases as of December 31, 2021 are as follows (dollars in thousands):​ ​ ​ ​
​ ​ Ground Leases
 2022 ​ $ 12,442
 2023 ​ ​ 12,442

Difference between future undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows ​ ​ (300,059)
Total operating lease liabilities (discounted) ​ $ 192,488

​
For purposes of recognizing our ground lease contracts, the Company uses the minimum lease payments, if stated in the agreement. For ground lease agreements where there is a rent reset provision based on a change in an index or a rate (i.e., changes in fair market rental rates or changes in the consumer price index) but that does not include a specified minimum lease payment, the Company uses the current rent over the remainder of the lease term. If there is a contingency upon which some or all of the variable lease payments that will be paid over the remainder of the lease term are based, which is resolved such that those payments now meet the definition of lease payments, the Company will remeasure the right-of-use asset and lease liability on the reset date.
The components of operating lease expenses were as follows (dollars in thousands):
​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​
------------------------------------ - ----------------------- ------ ---- - ------ - - -----
​ ​ Year Ended December 31,
​ ​ 2021 ​ 2020 ​ 2019

Variable lease expense (a) ​ ​ 78 ​ ​ 119 ​ ​ 664
Total operating lease expense (b)(c) ​ $ 13,002 ​ $ 12,940 ​ $ 8,936

(a) Variable lease expense includes adjustments such as changes in the consumer price index and payments based on a percentage of a community’s income.

(b) Lease expense is reported within the line item Other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(c) For the year ended December 31, 2021, Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities amortized by $3.5 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities amortized by $3.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities amortized by $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Due to the net impact of the amortization, the Company recorded $0.3 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million of total operating lease expense during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

​
Lessor - Apartment Home, Retail and Commercial Space Leases
​
UDR’s communities and retail and commercial space are leased to tenants under operating leases. As of December 31, 2021, our apartment home leases generally have initial terms of 12 months or less and represent approximately 99.1% of our total lease revenue. As of December 31, 2021, our retail and commercial space leases generally have initial terms of between 5 and 15 years and represent approximately 0.9% of our total lease revenue. Our apartment home leases are generally renewable at the end of the lease term, subject to potential increases in rental rates, and our retail and commercial space leases generally have renewal options, subject to associated increases in rental rates due to market-based or fixed-price renewal options and certain other conditions. (See Note 16, Reportable Segments for further discussion around our major revenue streams and disaggregation of our revenue.)
​
Future minimum lease payments from our retail and commercial leases as of December 31, 2021 are as follows (dollars in thousands):
​ ​ ​ ​
--------------------------------------- - ---------------------------- -------
​ ​ Retail and Commercial Leases
 2022 ​ $ 25,208

 2025 ​ ​ 18,541
 2026 ​ ​ 15,734
Thereafter ​ ​ 67,713
Total future minimum lease payments (a) ​ $ 172,591

(a) We have excluded our apartment home leases from this table as our apartment home leases generally have initial terms of 12 months or less.

Certain of our leases with retail and commercial tenants provide for the payment by the lessee of additional variable rent based on a percentage of the tenant’s revenue. The amounts shown in the table above do not include these variable percentage rents. The Company recorded variable percentage rents of $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

​
For purposes of classification of the above table, variable rate debt with a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is deemed as fixed rate debt due to the Company having effectively established a fixed interest rate for the underlying debt instrument.
Our secured debt instruments generally feature either monthly interest and principal or monthly interest-only payments with balloon payments due at maturity. As of December 31, 2021, secured debt encumbered approximately 12% of UDR’s total real estate owned based upon gross book value (approximately 88% of UDR’s real estate owned based on gross book value is unencumbered).
(a) At December 31, 2021, fixed rate mortgage notes payable are generally due in monthly installments of principal and interest and mature at various dates from July 2024 through February 2031 and carry interest rates ranging from 2.62% to 4.39%.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company assumed three fixed rate mortgage notes payable with an aggregate outstanding balance of $183.3 million and a fair value of $201.3 million in connection with the acquisition of three operating properties, which carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.93%. (see Note 3, Real Estate Owned).
​
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company prepaid zero and $111.1 million, respectively, of its fixed rate mortgage notes payable with proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured medium-term notes. The Company incurred net extinguishment costs of zero, $8.5 million and zero during years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, which was included in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
​
The Company will from time to time acquire properties subject to fixed rate debt instruments. In those situations, the Company records the debt at its estimated fair value and amortizes any difference between the fair value and par value to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt instrument.
(b) During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company had $3.9 million, $22.4 million, and $3.0 million, respectively, of amortization of the fair market adjustment of debt assumed in the acquisition of properties inclusive of its fixed rate mortgage notes payable and credit facilities, which was included in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The unamortized fair market adjustment was a net premium of $27.0 million and $12.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
​
 (c) The variable rate mortgage note payable secures a tax-exempt housing bond issue that matures in March 2032. Interest on this note is payable in monthly installments. As of December 31, 2021, the variable interest rate on the mortgage note was 0.71%.
(d) In September 2021, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $1.3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $350.0 million unsecured term loan (the “Term Loan”). The Credit Agreement allows the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the total borrowings under the Term Loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or more lenders. The Revolving Credit Facility has a scheduled maturity date of January 31, 2026, with two six-month extension options, subject to certain conditions. The Term Loan has a scheduled maturity date of January 31, 2027.
The Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s prior credit agreement, which provided for: (i) a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in January 2023 and (ii) a $350.0 million term loan scheduled to mature in September 2023. The prior credit agreement allowed the total commitments under the revolving credit facility and total borrowings under the term loan to be increased to an aggregate maximum amount of up to $2.0 billion, subject to certain conditions.
​
Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the Revolving Credit Facility has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 77.5 basis points and a facility fee of 15 basis points, and the Term Loan has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 85 basis points. Depending on the Company’s credit rating, the margin under the Revolving Credit Facility ranges from 70 to 140 basis points, the facility fee ranges from 10 to 30 basis points, and the margin under the Term Loan ranges from 75 to 160 basis points.
In November 2020, the Company entered into three interest rate swaps, which became effective in January 2021, to hedge against interest rate risk on the Term Loan until July 2022. The all-in weighted average interest rate, inclusive of the impact of the interest rate swaps, was 1.02%. In August 2021, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps totaling a $175.0 million notional value, which will become effective in July 2022, to hedge against interest rate risk on the Term Loan until July 2025. The all-in weighted average interest rate, inclusive of the impact of the interest rate swaps will be 1.48%.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and financial and other affirmative and negative covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, in certain cases subject to customary periods to cure. The occurrence of an event of default, following the applicable cure period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the unpaid principal, accrued and unpaid interest and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable.

(e) The Company has an unsecured commercial paper program. Under the terms of the program, the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding of $700.0 million. The notes are sold under customary terms in the United States commercial paper market and rank pari passu with all of the Company’s other unsecured indebtedness. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Operating Partnership.
In July 2021, the maximum aggregate amount was increased from $500.0 million to $700.0 million.

 (f) The Company has a working capital credit facility, which provides for a $75.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Working Capital Credit Facility”) with a scheduled maturity date of January 12, 2024. In September 2021, the Company amended the Working Capital Credit Facility to extend the maturity date from January 14, 2022 to January 12, 2024 and lower the margin range for the interest rate. Based on the Company’s current credit rating, the Working Capital Credit Facility now has an interest rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 77.5 basis points. Depending on the Company’s credit rating, the margin ranges from 70 to 140 basis points.

INCOME/(LOSS) PER SHARE
INCOME/(LOSS) PER SHARE 8. INCOME/(LOSS) PER SHAREThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income/(loss) per share for the periods presented (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data):​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​

Income/(loss) per weighted average common share: ​ ​ ​
Basic ​ $ 0.49 ​ $ 0.20 ​ $ 0.63
Diluted ​ $ 0.48 ​ $ 0.20 ​ $ 0.63

​
Basic income/(loss) per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted income/(loss) per common share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the common shares issuable from the assumed conversion of the OP Units and DownREIT Units, convertible preferred stock, stock options, unvested long-term incentive plan units (“LTIP Units”), unvested restricted stock and continuous equity program forward sales agreements. Only those instruments having a dilutive impact on our basic income/(loss) per share are included in diluted income/(loss) per share during the periods. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the effect of the conversion of the OP Units, DownREIT Units and the Company’s Series E preferred stock was not dilutive and therefore not included in the above calculation.
In July 2021, the Company entered into an ATM sales agreement under which the Company may offer and sell up to 20.0 million shares of its common stock, from time to time, to or through its sales agents and may enter into separate forward sales agreements to or through its forward purchasers. Upon entering into the ATM sales agreement, the Company simultaneously terminated the sales agreement for its prior at-the-market equity offering program, which was entered into in July 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold 1.6 million shares of common stock through its ATM program pursuant to the Company’s forward sales agreement described below. As of December 31, 2021, we had 18.4 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under the ATM program, including an aggregate of 4.4 million shares subject to the forward sales agreements described below.
In connection with any forward sales agreement under the Company’s ATM program, the relevant forward purchasers will borrow from third parties and, through the relevant sales agent, acting in its role as forward seller, sell a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to the number of shares underlying the agreement. The Company does not initially receive any proceeds from any sale of borrowed shares by the forward seller.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had entered into forward sales agreements under its current or prior ATM programs for a total of 10.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average initial forward price per share of $50.59, of which 4.4 million shares had not been settled. The actual forward price per share to be received by the Company upon settlement will be determined on the applicable settlement date based on adjustments made to the initial forward price to reflect the then-current federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock over the term of the forward sales agreement. As of December 31, 2021, 6.4 million shares under
the forward sales agreements under the ATM programs had been settled at a weighted average forward price per share of $47.79, which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate, the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock and commissions paid to sales agents of approximately $2.6 million, for net proceeds of $306.6 million. The final dates by which the remaining shares sold under the forward sales agreements under the ATM programs must be settled range between August 1, 2022 and September 14, 2022.
​
In March 2021, the Company entered into forward sale agreements to sell 7.0 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward price per share of $43.51. The actual forward price per share to be received by the Company upon settlement was determined on the applicable settlement date based on adjustments made to the initial forward price to reflect the then-current federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock over the term of the forward sales agreement. In September 2021, the Company settled all 7.0 million shares at a forward price per share of $42.65, which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate, the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock and commissions paid to sales agents of approximately $6.0 million, for net proceeds of $298.5 million.
​
In June 2021, the Company entered into forward sale agreements to sell 6.1 million shares of its common stock at an initial forward price per share of $49.22. The actual forward price per share to be received by the Company upon settlement will be determined on the applicable settlement date based on adjustments made to the initial forward price to reflect the then-current federal funds rate and the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock over the term of the forward sales agreement. In December 2021, the Company settled all 6.1 million shares at a forward price per share of $48.33, which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate, the amount of dividends paid to holders of UDR common stock and commissions paid to sales agents of approximately $5.4 million, for net proceeds of $294.8 million.
​
As described above, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company settled 19.5 million shares in aggregate under forward sales agreements under the ATM programs and previously announced forward sales agreements for net proceeds of $900.0 million. Aggregate net proceeds from such forward sales, after deducting related expenses, were $899.1 million.
​
As of February 11, 2022, we had 18.4 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under the ATM program, including an aggregate of 4.4 million shares subject to the forward sales agreements.
The Company generally has the ability to determine the dates and method of settlement (i.e., gross physical settlement, net share settlement or cash settlement), subject to certain conditions and the right of the counterparty to accelerate settlement under certain circumstances. The Company currently expects to fully physically settle each forward sales agreement with the relevant forward purchaser on one or more dates specified by the Company on or prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sales agreement, in which case the Company expects to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward sales agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, subject to certain exceptions, the Company may also elect, in its discretion, to cash settle or net share settle a particular forward sales agreement, in which case the Company may not receive any proceeds (in the case of cash settlement) or will not receive any proceeds (in the case of net share settlement), and the Company may owe cash (in the case of cash settlement) or shares of UDR common stock (in the case of net share settlement) to the relevant forward purchaser.
