Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Grainger’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Liquidity
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Grainger had cash and cash equivalents of $241 million and $585 million, respectively. The decrease in cash was primarily due to increased investment in capital expenditures and higher inventory purchases to meet customer demand. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $1.5 billion in available liquidity.

Cash Flows
Net cash provided by operating activities was $937 million and $1,123 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by working capital, primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable due to strong sales growth and inventory purchases to meet customer demand.

Net cash used in investing activities was $226 million and $179 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by investments in the Company's supply chain infrastructure.

Net cash used in financing activities was $1,039 million and $726 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by higher stock repurchases in the current year and prior year borrowings of long-term debt.

Working Capital
Internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and growth initiatives including capital expenditures. Working capital was $2,455 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $2,220 million at December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable due to strong sales growth, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable due to higher inventory purchases to meet customer demand. At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.7 and 2.6, respectively.

Capital Expenditures
For the year ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, capital expenditures were $255 million and $197 million, respectively. The increase was due to the Company's investment in the North American and Japanese distribution networks. In addition, the Company invested in the development of inventory management and technology enhancements.

Project spending for 2022 is expected to be in the range of $275 million and $325 million, which includes DC investments in the U.S. and Japan and IT enhancements. Grainger expects to fund 2022 capital spending primarily from operating cash flows.

Debt
Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit.

32

Total debt, which is defined as total interest-bearing debt and lease liabilities as a percent of total capitalization, was 55.4% and 55.6%, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Grainger receives ratings from two independent credit ratings agencies: Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's (S&P). Both credit rating agencies currently rate the Company's corporate credit at investment grade. The following table summarizes the Company's credit ratings at December 31, 2021:

------- --------- ---------------- ----------
 Corporate Senior Unsecured Short-term
Moody's A3 A3 P2
S&P A+ A+ A1

Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations
At December 31, 2021, the Company's material cash requirements for commitments and other contractual obligations, included outstanding debt obligations (Senior Notes) with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $2,384 million, with no amount payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Senior Notes total $1,921 million, with $87 million payable within 12 months.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, the Company had purchase obligations of $1,505 million, which includes $1,361 million payable within 12 months. Grainger's purchase obligations primarily include commitments to purchase inventory and other goods and services and uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment. Purchase obligations are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancellable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of Grainger’s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts. The Company considers an accounting policy to be a critical estimate if: (1) it involves assumptions that are uncertain when judgment was applied, and (2) changes in the estimate assumptions, or selection of a different estimate methodology, could have a significant impact on Grainger’s consolidated financial position and results. While the Company believes the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable, the Company’s management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventories
Company inventories primarily consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The majority of the Company’s inventory is accounted for using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Net realizable value is based on an analysis of inventory trends including, but not limited to, reviews of inventory levels, sales and cost information and on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product and shelf-life. The Company's methodology for estimating whether adjustments are necessary is continually evaluated for factors including significant changes in product demand, liquidation or disposition history values and market conditions such as inflation and other acquisition costs, including freight and duties. If business or economic conditions change, estimates and assumptions may be adjusted as deemed appropriate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. The fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow method and utilizing value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are primarily trade names. The fair value of trade names is calculated primarily using the relief-from-royalty method, which estimates the expected royalty savings attributable to the ownership of the trade name asset.

The estimates used to calculate the fair values of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involve the use of significant assumptions, estimates and judgments and changes from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, macroeconomic developments and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and impairment for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset. For further information on the Company's goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.

Contingencies and Legal Matters
The Company is subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company accrues for costs relating to litigation claims and other contingent matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. A detailed summary of the Company’s contingencies and legal matters is included in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.

Forward-Looking Statements
From time to time in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as in other written reports, communications and verbal statements, Grainger makes forward-looking statements that are not historical in nature but concern forecasts of future results, business plans, analyses, prospects, strategies, objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” under the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by their use of terms such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “expect,” “could,” “forecast,” “may,” “intend,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “will” or “would” and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions.

Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized and achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, which could cause Grainger’s results to differ materially from those that are presented.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: the unknown duration and health, economic, operational and financial impacts of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 and its variants (COVID-19), as well as the impact of actions taken or contemplated by government authorities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 (such as vaccine mandates for certain federal contractors, mask mandates, social distancing or other requirements) and to promote economic stability and recovery, on the Company’s businesses, its employees, customers and suppliers, including disruption to Grainger’s operations resulting from employee illnesses, the development, availability and usage of effective treatment or vaccines, changes in customers’ product needs, the acquisition of excess inventory leading to additional inventory carrying costs and inventory obsolescence, raw material, inventory and labor shortages, continued strain on global supply chains, and diminished transportation availability and efficiency, disruption caused by business responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including working remote arrangements, which may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, adaptions to the Company’s controls and procedures required by working remote arrangements, which could impact the design or operating effectiveness of such controls or procedures, and global or regional economic downturns or recessions, which could result in a decline in demand for the Company’s products; inflation, higher product costs or other expenses, including operational expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of sources of supply; changes in customer or product mix; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to enter into or sustain contractual arrangements on a satisfactory basis with group purchasing organizations; failure to develop, manage or implement new technology initiatives or business strategies; failure to adequately protect intellectual property or successfully defend against infringement claims; fluctuations or declines in the Company’s gross profit margin; the Company’s responses to market pressures; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings, including with respect to wage and hour, anti-bribery and corruption, environmental, advertising and marketing, consumer protection, pricing (including disaster or emergency declaration pricing statutes), product liability, compliance or safety, trade and export compliance, general commercial disputes, or privacy and cybersecurity matters; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards, including new or stricter environmental laws or regulations; government contract matters; disruption of information technology or data security systems involving the Company or third parties on which the Company depends; general industry, economic, market or political conditions; general global economic conditions including tariffs and trade issues and policies; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility, including price and trading volume volatility or price declines of the Company’s common stock; commodity price volatility; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; other pandemic diseases or viral contagions; natural or human induced disasters, extreme weather and other catastrophes or conditions; effects of climate change; competition for, or failure to attract, retain, train, motivate and develop key employees; loss of key members of management or key employees; changes in effective tax rates; changes in credit ratings or outlook; the Company’s incurrence of indebtedness and other factors identified under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger’s forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

[see Note 5]:
(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). Subsequent to our prior disclosure of 2020 industry information, the ARA decreased its estimate of the size of the North American equipment rental industry. As a result of this change, relative to our prior disclosures, our market share for 2020 increased and the size of the 2020 decline in North American equipment rental industry revenue decreased. COVID-19 COVID-19 was first identified in people in late 2019. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy. Uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside, which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. See "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook" below for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020. The health and safety of our employees and customers remains our top priority, and we also implemented a detailed COVID-19 response plan, which is explained in more detail in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and which we believe helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our results. We began to experience a decline in revenues in March 2020, when rental volume declined in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. The volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 ...
