PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

Loss on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt primarily consists of a make-whole payment in connection with the early redemption of our (i) 2.70% May 2017 Senior Notes and 2.65% November 2017 Senior Notes (Fiscal 2022) and (ii) 2.25% November 2017 senior notes (Fiscal 2021).

(Provision for) benefit from income taxes
The (provision for) benefit from income taxes decreased to $(309.4) million for Fiscal 2022 from $(511.1) million for Fiscal 2021. Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2022 was 99.7% as compared with 20.1% for Fiscal 2021. In comparison to prior year, our taxes were impacted primarily by:

•valuation allowances on a portion of the unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy and Canopy equity in earnings (losses);
•the effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses, including the impact of the long-lived asset impairment of brewery construction in progress; and
•a net income tax benefit from stock-based compensation award activity for Fiscal 2022 from changes in option exercise activity.

For additional information, refer to Note 13.

We expect our reported effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 19% to 21%. Since estimates are not currently available, this range does not reflect any future changes in the fair value of our Canopy investment measured at fair value and any future equity in earnings (losses) and related activities from the Canopy Equity Method Investment.

Net income (loss) attributable to CBI
Net income (loss) attributable to CBI decreased to $(40.4) million for Fiscal 2022 from $1,998.0 million for Fiscal 2021. This decrease of $2,038.4 million is largely attributable to (i) the unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy as compared with an unrealized net gain in Fiscal 2021, (ii) an impairment of long-lived assets for Fiscal 2022 in connection with certain assets at the Mexicali Brewery, (iii) the decrease in Wine and Spirits net sales due largely to the divestitures, and (iv) higher operational costs within the Beer segment, partially offset by strong shipment volume growth within the Beer segment and the decrease in the provision for income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. Our ability to consistently generate robust cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths; it enables us to invest in our people and our brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock. Our largest use of cash in our operations is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. Historically, we have used this cash flow to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. Additionally, our commercial paper program is used to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. We use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures.

We seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.

PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

In December 2021, we entered into an agreement with a financial institution for payable services. We plan to facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program through this participating financial institution in Fiscal 2023. The program will be available to certain of our suppliers allowing them the option to manage their cash flow. We will not be a party to the agreements between the participating financial institution and the suppliers in connection with the program. Our rights and obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, will not be impacted. We are still evaluating the impact of this program on future liquidity.

As of February 28, 2022, the exercise of all Canopy warrants held by us would have required a cash outflow of approximately $5.9 billion based on the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants.

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,705.4 $ 2,806.5 $ (101.1) (4) %

The net change in operating assets and liabilities was largely driven by (i) higher Fiscal 2022 inventory levels for the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments as compared to Fiscal 2021 inventory levels which were negatively impacted by climate-related events, (ii) increased accounts receivable for the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments, and (iii) higher income tax payments in Fiscal 2022 as compared to Fiscal 2021. This was partially offset by benefits from (i) accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments for both the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments and (ii) an exclusivity payment received in Fiscal 2022 related to distribution arrangements for our U.S. wine and spirits brand portfolio.

Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2022 increased primarily due to $994.9 million of lower proceeds from sale of business and $162.2 million of higher capital expenditures for Fiscal 2022 as compared with Fiscal 2021. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the $173.9 million exercise of the November 2017 Canopy Warrants in May 2020.

Bank facilities
In June 2021, the Company and the Administrative Agent and Lender amended the March 2020 Term Credit Agreement. The principal change effected by the June 2021 amendment was a reduction in LIBOR margin from 0.88% to 0.63% from June 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021.

In April 2022, we entered into the 2022 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the 2020 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Restatement Agreement resulted in (i) the refinance and increase of the existing revolving credit facility from $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion and extension of its maturity to April 14, 2027, (ii) the refinement of certain negative covenants, and (iii) the replacement of LIBOR rates with rates based on term SOFR. There are no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement.

In April 2022, the Company and the Administrative Agent and Lender amended the June 2021 Term Credit Agreement. The principal changes effected by the April 2022 amendment were the refinement of certain negative covenants and replacement of LIBOR rates with rates based on term SOFR.

Senior notes
In July 2021, we issued the 2.25% July 2021 Senior Notes. Proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $987.2 million were used towards the repayment of our 2.70% May 2017 Senior Notes and 2.65% November 2017 Senior Notes.

General
The majority of our outstanding borrowings as of February 28, 2022, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2023 to calendar 2050, and a variable-rate senior unsecured term loan facility under our June 2021 Term Credit Agreement with a calendar 2024 maturity date as follows:

Additionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility.

We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. If the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 Credit Agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. We do not expect that

fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility.

We had the following remaining borrowing capacity available under our 2020 Credit Agreement and 2022 Credit Agreement, respectively:

The financial institutions participating in our 2022 Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe they will comply with any future funding requests. However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.

As of February 28, 2022, we and our subsidiaries were subject to covenants that are contained in our 2020 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional subsidiary indebtedness, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio, both as defined in our 2020 Credit Agreement. As of February 28, 2022, under our 2020 Credit Agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 4.0x.

The representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default set forth in our June 2021 Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in our 2020 Credit Agreement.

Our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii) a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii) restrictions on mergers, consolidations, and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.

As of February 28, 2022, we were in compliance with our covenants under our 2020 Credit Agreement, our June 2021 Term Credit Agreement, and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.

For further discussion and presentation of our borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to Note 12.

Common Stock Dividends

On April 6, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share of Class A Stock, $0.72 per share of Class B Stock, and $0.72 per share of Class 1 Stock payable on May 19, 2022, to stockholders of record of each class as of the close of business on May 5, 2022. We expect to return approximately $600 million to stockholders in Fiscal 2023 through cash dividends.

We currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our Board of Directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.

Share Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our Class A Stock and Class B Stock under the 2018 Authorization and an additional repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our Class A Stock and Class B Stock under the 2021 Authorization. No shares have been repurchased under the 2021 Authorization.

During Fiscal 2022, we repurchased 6,179,015 shares of Class A Stock pursuant to the 2018 Authorization at an aggregate cost of $1,390.5 million, or an average cost of $225.04 per share, through a combination of open market transactions and an ASR. Pursuant to the ASR announced in June 2021, we repurchased 2,240,397 shares of Class A Stock at an average purchase price paid of $223.17 per share. We primarily used cash on hand to pay the purchase price for the repurchased shares.

On April 7, 2022, we entered into an additional ASR to repurchase $500.0 million of our Class A Stock. We utilized short-term borrowings and cash on hand to pay the dollar value for shares repurchased in this ASR under the 2018 Authorization.

As of April 21, 2022, total shares repurchased under the 2018 Authorization and the 2021 Authorization are as follows:

-------------------------------- ------------------------ ------- ---------------------------------- ---------------------------- ------- ----------
 Class A Common Shares
 Repurchase Authorization Dollar Value of Shares Repurchased Number of Shares Repurchased

2018 Authorization $ 3,000.0 $ 2,936.4 12,802,171
2021 Authorization $ 2,000.0 $ — —

Share repurchases under the 2018 Authorization and 2021 Authorization may be accomplished at management’s discretion from time to time based on market conditions, our cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management. Shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. We may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations and/or proceeds from borrowings. Any repurchased shares will become treasury shares, including shares repurchased under the 2018 Authorization.

We currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in the future, but such repurchases are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.

For additional information, refer to Note 17.

Capital Resources

We have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.

Capital Expenditures

During Fiscal 2022, we incurred $1,026.8 million for capital expenditures, including $849.5 million for the Beer segment primarily for the Mexico Beer Projects.

We plan to spend from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for capital expenditures in Fiscal 2023, including approximately $1.2 billion for the Beer segment associated primarily with the Mexico Beer Projects. The remaining planned Fiscal 2023 capital expenditures consist of improvements to existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. The Mexico Beer Projects are expected to be substantially completed by Fiscal 2026. Accordingly, for the Beer segment, we expect to spend $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion over Fiscal 2023 through Fiscal 2026, with the majority of spend expected to occur in the first three fiscal years of that timeframe. Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current and projected future business needs.

In fiscal 2017, we began construction of the Mexicali Brewery. In March 2020, a public consultation was held on the construction of our Mexicali Brewery. Following the negative result of the public consultation, we continue to work with government officials in Mexico to (i) determine next steps for our suspended Mexicali Brewery construction project, (ii) pursue various forms of recovery for capitalized costs and additional expenses incurred in establishing the brewery, however, there can be no assurance of any recoveries, and (iii) explore options to add further capacity at other locations in Mexico, including the construction of the Southeast Mexico Brewery where there is ample water and we will have a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs. See Note 7 for further discussion.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1. Certain policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management to determine appropriate assumptions to be used in certain estimates; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We review estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business on an ongoing basis. Our critical accounting estimates include:

•Equity method investments. We monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary impairment. We consider several factors when evaluating our investments, including, but not limited to, (i) the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value, (ii) operating and financial performance of the investee, (iii) the investee’s future business plans and projections, (iv) recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies, where available, (v) discussions with their management, and (vi) our ability and intent to hold the investment until it recovers in value.

Canopy Equity Method Investment – monitored for other-than-temporary impairment at each reporting date, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable. As of February 28, 2022, the carrying value of our Canopy Equity Method Investment exceeded the fair value by $1,488.7 million. If Canopy’s stock

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------
Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2022 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 52

------- ------------ -----------------
PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

price does not recover above our C$22.34 carrying value in the near-term, it may result in an impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment. There may also be a future impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment if our expectations about Canopy’s prospective results and cash flows decline, which could be influenced by a variety of factors including adverse market conditions or if Canopy records a significant impairment of goodwill or intangible or other long-lived assets, makes significant asset sales, or has changes in senior management.

•Fair value of financial instruments. Management’s estimate of fair value requires significant judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions and the availability of specific information. The fair values of our financial instruments that require the application of significant judgment by management are as follows:

Canopy investment
Equity securities, Warrants – estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement) and Monte Carlo simulations (Level 2 fair value measurement). These valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. Management applies significant judgment in its determination of expected volatility. We consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and apply limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.

Debt securities, Convertible – estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on market spreads using bond data as of the valuation date. This valuation model uses various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable.

•Goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets are classified into three categories: (i) goodwill, (ii) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, and (iii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization. For intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. We may perform a qualitative evaluation prior to a quantitative test to determine if an impairment exists. However, if the results of the qualitative evaluation are inconclusive or suggest an impairment may exist, we must proceed to the quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including market conditions, industry changes, actual results as compared to forecasted results, or the timing of recent acquisitions and/or divestitures. The quantitative test estimates the fair value utilizing assumptions and projections regarding items such as future cash flows, revenues, earnings, and other factors. The factors and assumptions used reflect management’s estimates and are based on historical trends, projections and assumptions, including expectations of future economic and competitive conditions that are used in current strategic operating plans, however, these are subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of January 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.

Goodwill – Our reporting units with goodwill include the Beer segment and the Wine and Spirits segment. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the qualitative assessment. We determined it is more likely than not the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value, and therefore no goodwill impairment was recognized related to this test. For Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, as a

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------
Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2022 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 53

------- ------------ -----------------
PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.

Other intangible assets – Our intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, we performed our annual trademark impairment analysis using both the qualitative and quantitative assessments. No indication of impairment was noted for our trademark units utilizing the qualitative assessment, with the exception of the Four Corners trademark. We proceeded with a quantitative impairment test for the Four Corners trademark as certain continued negative trends indicated the fair value may not exceed its carrying value. When using the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of trademark is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. The most significant assumption used in determining the estimated fair value was the annual revenue projection. No indication of impairment was noted using the quantitative test, as the estimated fair value of the Four Corners trademark was equal to its $4.0 million carrying amount.

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, certain negative trends within our Four Corners craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts indicating lower revenue and cash flow generation for the related portfolio. This change in financial forecasts indicated it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Four Corners trademark might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Beer segment’s Four Corners craft beer business recognized a $6.0 million impairment loss in connection with its trademark asset. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment’s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including increased rate of revenue decline and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Ballast Point craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset recognized an impairment loss of $11.0 million. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion.

Divestitures – When some, but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of, some of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of, if that portion constitutes a business. The allocation of goodwill is based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining. This approach requires a determination of the fair value of both the business being disposed and the businesses retained within the reporting unit.

For Fiscal 2021, our estimate of fair value for the Paul Masson Divestiture, the Wine and Spirits Divestitures, the Concentrate Business Divestiture, and the Ballast Point Divestiture was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transactions. The components sold were a part of the Wine and Spirits or Beer segment and were included in those reporting units through the date of divestiture. Goodwill was allocated to the assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the businesses being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets associated with the respective divestitures remained in the wine and spirits or beer reporting unit.

•Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes, and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws, and tax planning strategies. We are subject to income taxes in Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions. We are regularly audited by federal, state, and

foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved.

We believe all tax positions are fully supported. We recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the FASB guidance for income tax accounting. Accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. If necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not they will not be realized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical, and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. We believe it is more likely than not the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. Changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.

Change in Accounting Guidance

Accounting guidance adopted for Fiscal 2022 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2020, we issued $500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2023, $500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2025, $850 million of senior notes due February 1, 2027, and $1.30 billion of senior notes due February 1, 2030. Our total proceeds of approximately $3.14 billion, net of issuance discount, were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt instruments due in fiscal 2020. The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. Our senior notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The 27  net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.
