Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Effects of Inflation
Economies in some countries where we operate have periodically experienced high rates of inflation. Periods of higher inflation may affect various economic sectors in those countries and increase our cost of doing business there. Inflation may increase some of our expenses such as wages. While inflation may impact our results of operations and financial condition and it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition are not significant.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Capital Resources
Our cash generated from operations has been our primary source of liquidity to fund operations and investments to support the growth of our business. As of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,446.6 million, as well as $675.0 million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. See Note 9 “Debt” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding the terms of our revolving credit facility and information about debt.

Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (18,032) 9,357 3,530
Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 125,814 $ 385,845 $ 165,977

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period $ 1,449,347 $ 1,323,533 $ 937,688

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $27.9 million, or 5.1%, to $572.3 million, as compared to 2020 primarily driven by the increase in net income as well as an increase in accrued variable compensation expense in 2021. The increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable during 2021, largely attributable to the 41.3% growth in revenue in 2021 as compared to 2020.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $368.9 million compared to $167.2 million used in the same period in 2020. The cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to $315.0 million used during 2021 for the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, compared to $18.9 million used for the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, during 2020. Cash used for capital expenditures was $111.5 million in 2021 compared to cash used for capital expenditures of $68.8 million during the comparable period in 2020. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities was positively impacted by the maturity of $60.0 million of time deposits during 2021 and negatively impacted by the $60.0 million use of cash to purchase these time deposits during 2020. Furthermore, $2.5 million was used for purchases of non-marketable securities during 2021 compared to $20.5 million used in 2020.
Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $59.6 million, compared to $0.8 million net cash used in financing activities in 2020. During 2021, we received cash from the exercises of stock options issued under our long-term incentive plans of $26.3 million, compared to $26.4 million received in the corresponding period of 2020. These cash inflows were offset by cash used for the payments of withholding taxes related to net share settlements of restricted stock units of $41.6 million in 2021, compared to $20.1 million paid in 2020. Additionally, the year ended December 31, 2021 included payments of $40.2 million attributable to the acquisition-date fair value of contingent consideration compared to payments of $7.0 million attributable to acquisition-date fair value of contingent consideration during the year ended December 31, 2020.
Discussion of the comparison of the cash flows between 2020 and 2019 is included in “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Future Capital Requirements
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with our expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and that we possess the financial flexibility to execute our strategic objectives, including the ability to make acquisitions and strategic investments in the foreseeable future. However, our ability to generate cash is subject to our performance, general economic conditions, industry trends and other factors including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as described elsewhere in this MD&A. To the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are insufficient to fund our future activities and requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If we issue equity securities in order to raise additional funds, substantial dilution to existing stockholders may occur. If we raise cash through the issuance of additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional contractual restrictions on our business. There is no assurance that we would be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all.
Borrowings
See Note 8 “Leases” and Note 9 “Debt” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Off-Balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements
We do not have any material obligations under guarantee contracts or other contractual arrangements other than as disclosed in Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities where we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.

[See Note 9]:
Note 9 -- Derivative Instruments During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into two foreign currency swap agreements. The objective of both agreements is to manage the risk of changes in cash flows resulting from foreign currency gains/losses realized upon remeasurement of U.S. dollar denominated SCL senior notes by swapping a specified amount of Hong Kong dollars for U.S. dollars at the contractual spot rate. The terms in one of the contracts did not effectively match the terms of the related SCL senior notes; thus, it was not designated as hedging (the "Non-Hedging Swap"). The remaining contract was designated as a hedge of the cash flows related to a portion of the SCL senior notes (the "Hedging Swap," and together with the Non-Hedging Swap, the "FX Swaps"). The Non-Hedging Swap and the Hedging Swap have a total notional value of $500 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and expire in August 2023 and August 2025, respectively. The total fair value of the FX Swaps is recorded as an asset in other assets, net. The fair value of the FX Swaps was estimated using Level 2 inputs from recently reported market transactions of foreign currency exchange rates. For the Hedging Swap, the changes in fair value of the derivative were recognized as other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the foreign currency gains/losses incurred from the remeasurement of the portion of the SCL senior notes being hedged were also recognized in other comprehensive income. For the Non-Hedging Swap the changes in fair value of the derivative were recorded in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. In August 2018, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements (the "IR Swaps"), which qualified and were designated as fair value hedges, swapping fixed-rate for variable-rate interest to hedge changes in the fair value of the 2023, 2025 and 2028 SCL Senior Notes. These IR Swaps had a total not...

Note 8. Acquisitions Fitbit In January 2021, we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, a leading wearables brand for $2.1 billion. The addition of Fitbit to Google Services is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value. The purchase price excludes post acquisition compensation arrangements. The purchase price was attributed to $440 million cash acquired, $590 million of intangible assets, $1.2 billion of goodwill and $92 million of net liabilities assumed. Goodwill was recorded in the Google Services segment and primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Other Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $885 million, net of cash acquired, of which the total amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $118 million. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to our consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. 74 ----------------- -------------  Alphabet Inc.
