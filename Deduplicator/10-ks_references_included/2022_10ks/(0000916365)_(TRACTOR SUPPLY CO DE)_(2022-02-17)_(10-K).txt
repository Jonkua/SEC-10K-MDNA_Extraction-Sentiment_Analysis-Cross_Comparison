Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 18, 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

In addition to normal operating expenses and expenses associated with COVID-19, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, existing store remodeling and improvements, store relocations, distribution facility capacity and improvements, information technology, inventory purchases, repayment of existing borrowings under our debt facilities, share repurchases, cash dividends, and selective acquisitions as opportunities arise.

Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, cash provided from operations, remaining funds available under our debt facilities, operating and finance leases, and normal trade credit.  Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters to support the higher sales volume of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively.

We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, funds available under our debt facilities, operating and finance leases, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations, including expenses associated with COVID-19, and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, existing store remodeling and improvements,

store relocations, distribution facility capacity and improvements, and information technology improvements through the end of fiscal 2022. We are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity.

Working Capital

At December 25, 2021, the Company had working capital of $1.19 billion, which decreased $329.3 million from fiscal 2020.  The shifts in working capital were attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions):

---------------------------------------------- ----------------- ------- ----------------- ------- -------- ------- ------ - -------
 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Variance
Current assets:
Cash and cash equivalents $ 878.0 $ 1,341.8 $ (463.8)

Inventories 2,191.2 1,783.3 407.9
Prepaid expenses and other current assets 164.1 133.6 30.5
Income taxes receivable 17.1 — 17.1

Total current assets 3,250.4 3,258.7 (8.3)
Current liabilities:
Accounts payable 1,155.6 976.1 179.5
Accrued employee compensation 109.6 119.7 (10.1)
Other accrued expenses 474.4 324.8 149.6

Current portion of finance lease obligations 3.9 4.6 (0.7)
Current portion of operating lease obligations 321.3 298.7 22.6
Income taxes payable — 19.9 (19.9)

Total current liabilities 2,064.8 1,743.8 321.0
Working capital $ 1,185.6 $ 1,514.9 $ (329.3)

In comparison to December 26, 2020, working capital as of December 25, 2021 was impacted most significantly by changes in cash and cash equivalents, inventories, accounts payable and other accrued expenses.

•The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by share repurchases, capital expenditures to support strategic growth, and cash dividends to stockholders.
•The increase in inventories resulted from an increase in average inventory per store driven by our commitment to support our strong sales trends, along with the impact of inflation and the purchase of additional inventory to support new store growth.
•The increase in accounts payable resulted from the purchase of additional inventory to support new store growth and strong sales volume trends.
•Other accrued expenses increased primarily due to increases in freight and other payables due to the growth in sales.

Long-term debt $ 986.4 $ 984.3

Outstanding letters of credit $ 52.9 $ 48.7

On October 30, 2020, the Company issued and sold, in a public offering, $650 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due November 1, 2030 bearing interest at 1.75% per annum (the “1.75% Senior Notes”). In support of the issuance of the 1.75% Senior Notes, we obtained credit ratings from Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's.

We manage our business and financial ratios to target an investment-grade bond rating, which has historically allowed flexible access to financing at reasonable market costs. As of December 25, 2021, and the date of this filing, February 17, 2022, the Company's senior unsecured debt is rated “Baa1,” by Moody’s Investor Services with a stable outlook and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s with a stable outlook. These ratings have been obtained with the understanding that Moody’s Investors Services and Standard & Poor’s will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted. The ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our securities, may be changed, superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Our current ratings, as well as future rating agency actions, could impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms and affect our financing costs. There can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings.

We also maintain a $500 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) under the senior credit facility (the "Senior Credit Facility") with a sublimit of $50 million for swingline loans and a sublimit of $150 million for letters of credit.

For additional information about the Company’s debt and credit facilities, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations and funds available under our debt facilities.  Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures while principal uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company’s common stock and cash dividends paid to stockholders.

Operating Activities

Operating activities provided cash of $1.14 billion and $1.39 billion in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $255.8 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020, was due to changes in the following (in millions):

The $255.8 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020, is primarily driven by a significant increase in inventory and timing of payments and accruals, partially offset by an increase in our net income.

Investing Activities

Investing activities used cash of $627.3 million and $292.2 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The $335.1 million increase in net cash used in investing activities primarily reflects an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.

Index

Investing activities, including capital expenditures, for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):

-------------------------------------------------- ----------- ----- ---------- ----- - ----- ----- - -----
 Fiscal Year Variance

 (52 weeks) (52 weeks)
Existing stores $ 326.9 $ 73.7 $ 253.2

Proceeds from sale of property and equipment (1.1) (1.8) 0.7
Net cash used in investing activities $ 627.3 $ 292.2 $ 335.1

The increase in spending for existing stores in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 principally reflects our strategic initiatives related to store remodels, including internal space productivity and the outside side lot improvements. The spending on information technology represents continued support of our store growth and our omni-channel initiatives, as well as improvements in security and compliance, enhancements and upgrades to our customer loyalty program, mobility in our stores, and other strategic initiatives.

The increase in spending for distribution center capacity and improvements in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is principally related to beginning construction of a new distribution center in Navarre, Ohio, which is expected to be approximately 900,000 square feet and is currently anticipated to be completed in the fall of fiscal 2022.

The above table reflects an investment in 80 new Tractor Supply stores, and seven new Petsense stores during fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2020, we opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores, nine new Petsense stores, and had one store relocation.

Our projected capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are currently estimated to be in a range of approximately $625 million to $675 million. The capital expenditures include a plan to open approximately 75 to 80 new Tractor Supply stores, remodel more than 150 stores and transform the side lots in approximately 100 locations, along with opening 10 new Petsense stores. We also anticipate the opening of our ninth distribution center in Navarre, Ohio in the fall of 2022. Additionally, we plan to begin construction in the middle of fiscal 2022 on a new distribution center in Maumelle, Arkansas, which is currently anticipated to be complete in late 2023. In addition, we plan to support our continued improvements in technology and infrastructure at our existing stores, and ongoing investments to enhance our digital and omni-channel capabilities to better serve our customers.

Financing Activities

Financing activities used cash of $975.1 million in fiscal 2021, while financing activities provided $155.2 million in fiscal 2020. The $1.13 billion decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020, was due to changes in the following (in millions):

--------------------------------------------------- ----------- ------- ---------- ------- -------- ----- ------- - ---------
 Fiscal Year

 2021 2020 Variance

Index
The decrease in net cash from financing activities in fiscal 2021, compared to fiscal 2020, is principally due to actions taken in fiscal 2020 intended to strengthen our liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, including borrowings under our debt facilities as well as a temporary suspension of our share repurchase program.

Repurchase of Common Stock

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized common stock repurchases under a share repurchase program which was announced in February 2007. The authorization amount of the program, which has been increased from time to time, is currently authorized for up to $6.50 billion, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such repurchases. The currently authorized amount reflects a $2.0 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program which was approved by our Board of Directors on January 26, 2022. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. The program may be limited, temporarily paused, or terminated at any time without prior notice.

We repurchased approximately 4.4 million and 3.4 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $798.9 million and $343.0 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.  As of December 25, 2021, prior to the expanded $2.0 billion repurchase authorization, the Company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $345.0 million, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses. Shares repurchased in fiscal 2020 were impacted by the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program from March 12, 2020 until November 5, 2020, in order to strengthen our liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Our projected share repurchases for fiscal 2022 are currently estimated to be in a range of approximately $700 million to $800 million.

Cash Dividends Paid to Stockholders

We paid cash dividends totaling $239.0 million and $174.7 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. In fiscal 2021, we declared and paid cash dividends to stockholders of $2.08 per common share outstanding as compared to $1.50 per common share outstanding in fiscal 2020. These payments reflect an increase in the quarterly dividend in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to $0.52 per share from $0.40 per share and an increase in the quarterly dividend in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 from $0.35 per share.

On January 26, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.92 per share of the Company’s outstanding common stock.  The dividend will be paid on March 8, 2022, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 21, 2022.

It is the present intention of the Company’s Board of Directors to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend; however, the declaration and payment amount of future dividends will be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend upon the earnings, financial condition, and capital needs of the Company, along with any other factors which the Company’s Board of Directors deem relevant.
