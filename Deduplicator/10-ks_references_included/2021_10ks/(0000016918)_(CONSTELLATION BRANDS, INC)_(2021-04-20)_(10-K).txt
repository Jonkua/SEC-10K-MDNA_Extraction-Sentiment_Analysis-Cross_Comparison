Net income (loss) attributable to CBI
Net income (loss) attributable to CBI increased to $1,998.0 million for Fiscal 2021 from $(11.8) million for Fiscal 2020. This increase of $2,009.8 million is largely attributable to (i) the unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy in Fiscal 2021 as compared with an unrealized net loss in Fiscal 2020, (ii) an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale for Fiscal 2020, (iii) and strong volume growth within the Beer segment, partially offset by the Fiscal 2021 provision for income taxes as compared with a benefit from income taxes for Fiscal 2020.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. Our ability to consistently generate robust cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths, it enables us to invest in our people and brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock. Our largest use of cash in our operations is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. Historically, we have used this cash flow to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. Additionally, our commercial paper program is used to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. We use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures. COVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy and financial markets. A prolonged impact could interfere with our ability to access sources of liquidity or at favorable rates and to generate sufficient operating cash flows. We also have used opportunities to defer some payments including certain payroll taxes under the CARES Act afforded to us during the pandemic.

We seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.

On May 1, 2020, we exercised the November 2017 Canopy Warrants for an aggregate amount of C$245.0 million, or $173.9 million with cash from operations.

Operating activities
The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2021 is largely due to strong cash flow from the Beer segment driven primarily by the segment’s solid operating results, combined with the timing of collections for recoverable value-added taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities also benefited from reduced inventories for the Wine and Spirits segment as a result of the 2020 U.S. wildfires. The increase in net

PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher income tax payments in Fiscal 2021 primarily due to a change in estimated taxable income and the receipt of a federal tax refund in Fiscal 2020.

Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2021 decreased primarily due to higher proceeds from sale of business of $729.8 million for Fiscal 2021 as compared with Fiscal 2020. The decrease was partially offset by the May 2020 exercise of the November 2017 Canopy Warrants for $173.9 million and higher Fiscal 2021 capital expenditures of $138.1 million.

Debt

Total debt outstanding as of February 28, 2021, amounted to $10,442.3 million, a decrease of $1,742.3 million from February 29, 2020. This decrease consisted of:

 -------------- -------------
 Debt repayment Debt issuance

Bank facilities
In March 2020, we entered into the 2020 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the 2018 Credit Agreement. This resulted in (i) the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the guarantee agreement, (ii) the inclusion of the parent guaranty provisions in connection with the termination of the guarantee agreement, (iii) the removal of certain provisions pertaining to term loans since no term loans are outstanding, and (iv) the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions to permit the use of rates based on the SOFR administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

In March 2020, we entered into the Term Loan Restatement Agreement and the 2020 Term Loan Restatement Agreement, that amended and restated the Term Credit Agreement and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement, respectively. These new agreements each resulted in (i) the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the respective guarantee agreements and (ii) the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions in each to permit the use of rates based on SOFR. We prepaid the remaining outstanding Three-Year Term Facility and Five-Year Term Facility borrowings under our 2020 Term Credit Agreement in Fiscal 2021.

Senior notes
In April 2020, we issued the April 2020 Senior Notes. Proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $1,183.3 million were primarily used for the repayment of our 2.25% November 2017 Senior Notes and a portion of the Three-Year Term Facility outstanding obligations under our 2020 Term Credit Agreement.

In November 2020, we repaid the Senior Floating Rate Notes with cash on hand. In February 2021, we repaid the 3.75% May 2013 Senior Notes utilizing cash proceeds from the Wine and Spirits Divestitures.

General
The majority of our outstanding borrowings as of February 28, 2021, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2022 to calendar 2050, and a variable-rate senior

unsecured term loan facility under our March 2020 Term Credit Agreement, originally entered into in June 2019, with a calendar 2024 maturity date as follows:

Additionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2020 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility under our 2020 Credit Agreement.

We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. If the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2020 Credit Agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. We do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility under our 2020 Credit Agreement.

We had the following borrowing capacity available under our 2020 Credit Agreement:

The financial institutions participating in our 2020 Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe they will comply with any future funding requests. However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in our 2020 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a

The representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default set forth in our March 2020 Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in our 2020 Credit Agreement.

Our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii) a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii) restrictions on mergers, consolidations, and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.

As of February 28, 2021, we were in compliance with our covenants under our 2020 Credit Agreement, our March 2020 Term Credit Agreement, and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.

For further discussion and presentation of our borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to Note 12.

Common stock dividends

On April 7, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.76 per share of Class A Common Stock, $0.69 per share of Class B Convertible Common Stock, and $0.69 per share of Class 1 Common Stock payable on May 18, 2021, to stockholders of record of each class on May 4, 2021. We expect to return approximately $580 million to stockholders in Fiscal 2022 through cash dividends.

We currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our Board of Directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.

Share Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock under the 2018 Authorization and the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock under the 2021 Authorization. Shares repurchased under the 2018 Authorization have become treasury shares. No shares were repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

As of February 28, 2021, total shares repurchased under the 2018 Authorization and the 2021 Authorization are as follows:

2021 Authorization $ 2,000.0 $ — —

Share repurchases under the 2018 Authorization and 2021 Authorization may be accomplished at management’s discretion from time to time based on market conditions, our cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management. Shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. We may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations and/or proceeds from borrowings. Any repurchased shares will become treasury shares.

We currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in the future, but such repurchases are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.

For additional information, refer to Note 17.

Capital Resources

We have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs. As of February 28, 2021, our $460.6 million cash and cash equivalent balance reflects the recent sale of a portion of our wine and spirits business.

The following sets forth information about our outstanding obligations at February 28, 2021. For a detailed discussion of the items noted in the following table, refer to Notes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.

Capital expenditures

During Fiscal 2021, we incurred $864.6 million for capital expenditures, including $693.9 million for the Beer segment primarily for the Mexico Beer Projects.

We plan to spend from $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in Fiscal 2022, including approximately $900 million for the Beer segment associated primarily with the Mexico Beer Projects. The remaining planned Fiscal 2022 capital expenditures consist of improvements to existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. The Mexico Beer Projects are expected to be completed by Fiscal 2025. Accordingly, we expect to spend approximately $700 million to $900 million annually in Fiscal 2023 through Fiscal 2025 for the Beer segment. Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs.

In fiscal 2017, we began construction of the Mexicali Brewery. In March 2020, a public consultation was held on the construction of our Mexicali Brewery. Following the negative result of the public consultation, we are in discussions with government officials in Mexico regarding next steps for our brewery construction project and options elsewhere in the country. We intend to continue working with government officials to mutually agree upon a path forward. At this time, we have suspended all Mexicali Brewery construction activities. See Note 23 for further discussion.

Critical accounting policies and estimates

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1. Certain policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management to determine appropriate assumptions to be used in certain estimates; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We review estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business on an ongoing basis. Our critical accounting estimates include:

•Fair value of financial instruments. Management’s estimate of fair value requires significant judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions and the availability of specific information. The fair values of our financial instruments that require the application of significant judgment by management are as follows:

Canopy investment
Equity securities, Warrants – estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement) and Monte Carlo simulations (Level 2 fair value measurement). These valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. Management applies significant judgment in its determination of expected volatility. We consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and apply limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.

Debt securities, Convertible – estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on market spreads using bond data as of the valuation date. This valuation model uses various market-based inputs,

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------
Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2021 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 48

------- ------------ -----------------
PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

including stock price, remaining term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable.

•Goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets are classified into three categories: (i) goodwill, (ii) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, and (iii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding items such as future cash flows, revenues, earnings, and other factors. The assumptions used reflect management’s estimates and are based on historical trends, projections and assumptions, including expectations of future economic and competitive conditions that are used in current strategic operating plans, however, are subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of January 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.

Goodwill – Our reporting units with goodwill include the Beer segment and the Wine and Spirits segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the quantitative assessment. No indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. Based on this analysis, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the Wine and Spirits reporting unit with approximately 108% excess fair value. For Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.

The most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with the impairment testing are: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iii) the annual cash flow projections. As of January 1, 2021, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit’s net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value. Therefore, we did not have any indication of potential impairment.

Other intangible assets – consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Using the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Beer segment’s Four Corners craft beer business recognized a $6.0 million impairment loss in connection with its trademark asset. Certain negative trends within our Four Corners craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts indicating lower revenue and cash flow generation for the related portfolio. This change in financial forecasts indicated it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Four Corners craft beer trademark might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment’s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------
Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2021 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 49

------- ------------ -----------------
PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

increased rate of revenue decline and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Ballast Point craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset recognized an impairment loss of $11.0 million. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Beer segment’s Ballast Point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $108.0 million in connection with certain continuing negative trends within its craft beer portfolio and a change in strategy for this portfolio focused on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion.

The most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are: (i) the estimated royalty rate, (ii) the discount rate, (iii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iv) the annual revenue projections. As of January 1, 2021, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting’s carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.

Divestitures – When some, but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of, some of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of, if that portion constitutes a business. The allocation of goodwill is based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining. This approach requires a determination of the fair value of both the business being disposed and the businesses retained within the reporting unit.

For Fiscal 2021, our estimate of fair value for the Paul Masson Divestiture, the Wine and Spirits Divestitures, the Concentrate Business Divestiture, and the Ballast Point Divestiture was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transactions. The components sold were a part of the Wine and Spirits or Beer segment and were included in those reporting units through the date of divestiture. Goodwill was allocated to the assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the businesses being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets associated with the respective divestitures remained in the wine and spirits or beer reporting unit.

•Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes, and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws, and tax planning strategies. We are subject to income taxes in Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions. We are regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved.

We believe all tax positions are fully supported. We recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the FASB guidance for income tax accounting. Accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------
Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2021 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 50

------- ------------ -----------------
PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. If necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not they will not be realized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical, and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. We believe it is more likely than not the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. Changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.

Change in Accounting Guidance

Accounting guidance adopted for Fiscal 2021 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

[refer to Note 12]:
Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other Contractual Commitments We also have $7.50 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020, which are mostly related to our investments in network infrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs and data center operations.

Note 23. Derivative and Hedging Instruments The Company monitors and manages its foreign currency and interest rate exposures as part of its overall risk management program which focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on its operating results. A primary objective of the Company's risk management strategies is to reduce the financial impact that may arise from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates principally through the use of both foreign exchange derivative contracts (Derivatives) and foreign currency denominated debt (Net Investment Hedge). In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of interest rate movements on the Company's aggregate liability portfolio, including potential future debt issuances (Cash Flow Hedges). Foreign Exchange Risk Derivatives The Company enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to manage currency exposure associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are valued based on currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. The Company may also enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company is subject to foreign exchange risk as part of its daily settlement activities. This risk is typically limited to a few days between when a payment transaction takes place and the subsequent settlement with customers. To manage this risk, the Company enters into short duration foreign exchange derivative contracts based upon anticipated receipts and disbursements for the respective currency position. The objective of these activities is to reduce the Company's exposure to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against its functional currencies. The Company's derivative contracts are summarized below:...
