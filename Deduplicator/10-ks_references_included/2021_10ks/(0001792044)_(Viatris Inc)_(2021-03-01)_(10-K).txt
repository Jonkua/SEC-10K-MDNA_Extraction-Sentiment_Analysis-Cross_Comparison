Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K as permitted by the amendments.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which supersedes FASB Topic 840, Leases (Topic 840) and provides principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-
line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a ROU asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than twelve months regardless of classification. Leases with a term of twelve months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The Company adopted the provisions of Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis applying the guidance to leases existing as of this effective date. We elected to apply the available package of transitional practical expedients which permitted us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions regarding lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We have also elected to apply the short-term lease recognition exemption which means we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases that qualify both at transition and on a go-forward basis. In addition, we have elected to apply the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases except for those related to certain limited supply arrangements. We will continue to report periods prior to January 1, 2019 in our financial statements under prior guidance as outlined in Topic 840. Upon adoption of Topic 842, the Company determined that there was no cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 6 Leases for additional information.
In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The changes took effect for the Company as of January 1, 2019. The impact of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (“ASU 2018-14”). ASU 2018-14 removes certain disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures and added additional disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption in any interim period permitted. The amendments in ASU 2018-14 would need to be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s disclosures.
    Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted
In January 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-01, Clarifying the Interactions Between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (“ASU 2020-01”), which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative in accordance with Topic 321 immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. In addition, ASU 2020-01 states that for the purpose of applying paragraph 815-10-15-141(a) an entity should not consider whether, upon the settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method in Topic 323 or the fair value option in accordance with the financial instruments guidance in Topic 825. ASU 2020-01 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption in any interim period permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 applies only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Entities can apply the provisions of ASU 2020-04 immediately, as applicable, and generally the provisions of the guidance are available through December 31, 2022 as entities transition away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) which is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions and simplifying certain requirements under Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption in any interim period permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
 Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Viatris and those of its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in equity method affiliates are recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of the affiliates’ cumulative results of operations, capital contributions and distributions. Noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries are generally recorded net of tax as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.
 Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
 Foreign Currencies. The consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of Viatris. Statements of Operations and Cash Flows of all of the Company’s subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than U.S. Dollars are translated at a weighted average exchange rate for the period for inclusion in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, whereas assets and liabilities are translated at the end of the period exchange rates for inclusion in the consolidated balance sheets. Translation differences are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity as foreign currency translation adjustments. Gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currency, which arise as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
 Debt and Equity Securities. Debt securities classified as available-for-sale on the date of purchase are recorded at fair value, with net unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a
component of shareholders’ equity. Net realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale debt securities are computed on a specific security basis and are included in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Debt securities classified as trading securities are valued using the quoted market price from broker or dealer quotations or transparent pricing sources at the reporting date. Fair value is determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness, credit risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity. Debt securities are reviewed for impairment by assessing if the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary.
Investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost minus any impairment, plus or minus changes in their estimated fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Investments in entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting when the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the investee is maintained. The share of net income or losses of equity method investments are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values and investments in equity accounted for using the equity method are assessed for potential impairment on a quarterly basis based on qualitative factors.

Concentrations of Credit Risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of interest-bearing investments, derivatives and accounts receivable.
Viatris invests its excess cash in high-quality, liquid money market instruments, principally overnight deposits and highly rated money market funds. The Company maintains deposit balances at certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured amounts. Periodically, the Company reviews the creditworthiness of its counterparties to derivative transactions, and it does not expect to incur a loss from failure of any counterparties to perform under agreements it has with such counterparties.
 Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost principally determined by the weighted average cost method. Provisions for potentially obsolete or slow-moving inventory, including pre-launch inventory, are made based on our analysis of product dating, inventory levels, historical obsolescence and future sales forecasts. Included as a component of cost of sales is expense related to the net realizable value of inventories.
 Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed and recorded on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated service lives (3 to 18 years for machinery and equipment and other fixed assets and 15 to 39 years for buildings and improvements). Capitalized software is included in property, plant and equipment and is amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill. Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is generally recorded on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years. The Company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of intangible assets and makes adjustments when events indicate that a shorter life is appropriate.
The Company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of the ASC 805, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values. The cost to acquire businesses is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on estimates of their respective fair values. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&D are capitalized at the date of acquisition and, at that time, such IPR&D assets have indefinite lives. As products in development are approved for sale, amounts are allocated to product rights and licenses and will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the expected life of the asset. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Purchases of developed products and licenses that are accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized over an estimated useful life. IPR&D assets acquired as part of an asset acquisition are expensed immediately if they have no alternative future uses.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based on management's assessment of the fair value of the Company's reporting units as compared to their related carrying value. Under the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to use qualitative factors and determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount is less than its fair value, then no impairment is recognized. If the carrying amount recorded exceeds the fair value calculated, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The judgments made in determining the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value can materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Indefinite-lived intangibles, principally IPR&D, are tested at least annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The impairment test for IPR&D consists of a comparison of the asset’s fair value with its carrying value. Impairment is determined to exist when the fair value of IPR&D assets, which is based upon updated forecasts and commercial development plans, is less than the carrying value of the assets being tested.

Contingent Consideration. Viatris records contingent consideration resulting from business acquisitions at its estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, the Company revalues these obligations and records increases or decreases in their fair value as adjustments to litigation settlements and other contingencies, net within the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates, payment periods and adjustments in the probability of achieving future development steps, regulatory approvals, market launches, sales targets and profitability. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market.
Significant judgment is employed in determining the assumptions utilized as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent measurement period. Accordingly, changes in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The carrying values of long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, are evaluated periodically in relation to the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets and monitored for other potential triggering events. The assessment for impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets or asset grouping by analyzing the expected future undiscounted pre-tax cash flows specific to the asset or asset grouping. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows.
Significant management judgment is involved in estimating the recoverability of these assets and is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates, as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific asset or asset grouping. Any future long-lived assets impairment charges could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
 Short-Term Borrowings. The Company’s subsidiaries in India have working capital facilities with several banks which are secured by its current assets. MPI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, also has the CP Notes, Receivables Facility, which will expire in April 2022 and the Note Securitization Facility. Under the terms of each of the Receivables Facility and Note Securitization Facility, certain of our accounts receivable secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities. As the accounts receivable do not transfer to the banks, any amounts outstanding under the facilities are recorded as borrowings and the underlying receivables continue to be included in accounts receivable, net, in the consolidated balance sheets.
 Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC 606. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes net revenue for product sales when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration, including discounts, rebates, governmental rebate programs, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, promotional programs and other sales allowances. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid in cash). Amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgements about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The following section briefly describes the nature of our provisions for variable consideration and how such provisions are estimated:
•Chargebacks: the Company has agreements with certain indirect customers, such as independent pharmacies, retail pharmacy chains, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers, which establish contract prices for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products, which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Viatris will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler’s invoice price. Such credits are called chargebacks. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels.
•Rebates, promotional programs and other sales allowances: this category includes rebate and other programs to assist in product sales. These programs generally provide that the customer receives credit directly related to the amount of purchases or credits upon the attainment of pre-established volumes. Also included in this category are prompt pay discounts, administrative fees and price adjustments to reflect decreases in the selling prices of products.
•Returns: consistent with industry practice, Viatris maintains a return policy that allows customers to return a product, which varies country by country in accordance with local practices, generally within a specified period prior (six months) and subsequent (twelve months) to the expiration date. The Company’s estimate of the provision for returns is generally based upon historical experience with actual returns. Generally, returned products are destroyed and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.
•Governmental rebate programs: government reimbursement programs in the U.S. include Medicare, Medicaid, and State Pharmacy Assistance Programs established according to statute, regulations and policy. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products that are covered by the Medicaid program are required to pay rebates to each state based on a statutory formula set forth in the Social Security Act. Medicare beneficiaries are eligible to obtain discounted prescription drug coverage from private sector providers. In addition, certain states have also implemented supplemental rebate programs that obligate manufacturers to pay rebates in excess of those required under federal law. Our estimate of these rebates is based on the historical trends of rebates paid as well as on changes in wholesaler inventory levels and increases or decreases in the level of sales. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap” based on historical experience of prescriptions and utilization expected to result in the discount of the “coverage gap”.
Outside the U.S. the majority of our pharmaceutical sales are contractually or legislatively governed. In certain European countries, certain rebates are calculated on the governments total pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sale thresholds. We utilize historical data and obtain third party information to determine the adequacy of these accruals. Also, this provision includes price reductions that are mandated by law outside of the U.S.
Our net sales may be impacted by wholesaler and distributor inventory levels of our products, which can fluctuate throughout the year due to the seasonality of certain products, pricing, the timing of product demand, purchasing decisions and other factors. Such fluctuations may impact the comparability of our net sales between periods.Consideration received from licenses of intellectual property is recorded as other revenues. Royalty or profit share amounts, which are based on sales of licensed products or technology, are recorded when the customer’s subsequent sales or usages occur. Such consideration is included in other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.
 Research and Development. R&D expenses are charged to operations as incurred.
 Income Taxes. Income taxes have been provided for using an asset and liability approach in which deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of events that the Company has already recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. Changes in enacted tax rates or laws may result in adjustments to the recorded tax assets or liabilities in the period that the new tax law is enacted.

Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to holders of Viatris Inc. common stock by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to holders of Viatris Inc. common stock by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding related to potentially dilutive securities or instruments, if the impact is dilutive.
Mylan was authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of its ordinary shares under its repurchase program that was previously approved by the Mylan’s board of directors and announced on November 16, 2015, but was not obligated to acquire
any particular amount of ordinary shares. In 2018, Mylan repurchased approximately 9.8 million of ordinary shares at a cost of approximately $432.0 million.
Basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Viatris Inc. are calculated as follows:

 Share-Based Compensation. The fair value of share-based compensation is recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period.
 Derivatives. From time to time the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments (mainly foreign currency exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and purchased equity call options) designed to: 1) hedge the cash flows resulting from existing assets and liabilities and transactions expected to be entered into over the next 24 months in currencies other than the functional currency, 2) hedge the variability in interest expense on floating rate debt, 3) hedge the fair value of fixed-rate notes, 4) hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact future debt issuances, 5) hedge cash or share payments required on conversion of issued convertible notes, 6) hedge a net investment in a foreign operation, or 7) economically hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with the purchase price of non-U.S. acquisitions. Derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. When the derivative instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value are deferred through other comprehensive earnings. If a derivative instrument qualifies as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged items, are generally included in interest expense. When such instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting the changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within other expense, net

Financial Instruments. The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of short-term and long-term debt, interest rate swaps, forward contracts and option contracts. The Company’s financial instruments also include cash and cash equivalents as well as accounts and other receivables and accounts payable, the fair values of which approximate their carrying values. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging foreign currency and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations, or to hedge cash, and have been used to hedge share payments required on conversion of issued convertible notes. The Company carries derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, determined by reference to market data such as forward rates for currencies, implied volatilities, and interest rate swap yield curves. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. In addition, the Company has designated certain long-term debt instruments as net investment hedges.
Fair value is based on the price that would be received from the sale of an identical asset or paid to transfer an identical liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below:
Level 1:        Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.
Level 2:        Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 3:        Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value

Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards and Amended SEC Rules
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief (“ASU 2019-05”). ASU 2019-05 provides transition relief for ASU 2016-13 by providing entities with an alternative to irrevocably elect the fair value option for eligible financial assets measured at amortized cost upon adoption of ASU 2016-13. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2016-13 and its subsequent revisions as of January 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-03”), which adds to and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements including a requirement to disclose changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and a requirement to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2018-13 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”). The objective of this update is to clarify and align the accounting and capitalization of implementation costs for hosting arrangements, regardless of whether they convey a license to the hosted software. The updated guidance will require an entity in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract, to follow guidance in ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset and which costs to expense. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2018-15 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In November 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808)—Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 (“ASU 2018-18”). The amendments in ASU 2018-18 make targeted improvements to U.S. GAAP for collaborative arrangements by clarifying that certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue under Topic 606 when the collaborative arrangement participant is a customer in the context of a unit of account. In those situations, all the guidance in Topic 606 should be applied, including recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements. In addition, unit-of-account guidance in Topic 808 was aligned with the guidance in Topic 606 (that is, a distinct good or service) when an entity is assessing whether the collaborative arrangement or a part of the arrangement is within the scope of Topic 606. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2018-18 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2020, the SEC amended Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X regarding the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered. Among other things, the amendments narrow the circumstances that require separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors and streamline the alternative disclosures required in lieu of those financial statements. The effective date of the amendment is January 4, 2021 with earlier voluntary compliance permitted. We have chosen to voluntarily comply with the amended rules effective during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and have included the required disclosures as a component of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K as permitted by the amendments.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which supersedes FASB Topic 840, Leases (Topic 840) and provides principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-
line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a ROU asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than twelve months regardless of classification. Leases with a term of twelve months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The Company adopted the provisions of Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis applying the guidance to leases existing as of this effective date. We elected to apply the available package of transitional practical expedients which permitted us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions regarding lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We have also elected to apply the short-term lease recognition exemption which means we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases that qualify both at transition and on a go-forward basis. In addition, we have elected to apply the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases except for those related to certain limited supply arrangements. We will continue to report periods prior to January 1, 2019 in our financial statements under prior guidance as outlined in Topic 840. Upon adoption of Topic 842, the Company determined that there was no cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 6 Leases for additional information.
In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The changes took effect for the Company as of January 1, 2019. The impact of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (“ASU 2018-14”). ASU 2018-14 removes certain disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures and added additional disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption in any interim period permitted. The amendments in ASU 2018-14 would need to be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s disclosures.
    Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted
In January 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-01, Clarifying the Interactions Between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (“ASU 2020-01”), which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative in accordance with Topic 321 immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. In addition, ASU 2020-01 states that for the purpose of applying paragraph 815-10-15-141(a) an entity should not consider whether, upon the settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method in Topic 323 or the fair value option in accordance with the financial instruments guidance in Topic 825. ASU 2020-01 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption in any interim period permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 applies only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Entities can apply the provisions of ASU 2020-04 immediately, as applicable, and generally the provisions of the guidance are available through December 31, 2022 as entities transition away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) which is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions and simplifying certain requirements under Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption in any interim period permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

 Acquisitions and Other Transactions
Upjohn Business Combination Agreement
On July 29, 2019, Mylan, Pfizer, Upjohn Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer, and certain other affiliated entities entered into a Business Combination Agreement pursuant to which the Company would combine with the Upjohn Business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. The Upjohn Business was a global, primarily off-patent branded and generic established medicines business, which includes 20 primarily off-patent solid oral dose legacy brands, such as Lyrica, Lipitor, Celebrex and Viagra. The Combination was completed on November 16, 2020.
Prior to the Combination and pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Pfizer had, among other things, transferred to Viatris substantially all of the assets and liabilities comprising the Upjohn Business (the Separation) and, thereafter, Pfizer had distributed to Pfizer stockholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of Viatris (the Distribution). When the Distribution and Combination were complete, Pfizer stockholders as of the record date of the Distribution owned 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock and Mylan shareholders as of immediately before the Combination owned 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted basis. Viatris also made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12 billion, which was funded with the proceeds of debt incurred by Upjohn prior to the Combination.
The transaction involved multiple legal entity restructuring transactions and a reverse merger acquisition with Viatris representing the legal acquirer and Mylan representing the accounting acquirer of the Upjohn Business. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, Mylan is considered the accounting acquirer of the Upjohn Business and Viatris applied purchase accounting to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the Upjohn Business as of November 16, 2020. The debt incurred by Upjohn prior to the Combination was a liability assumed in purchase accounting. The fair value of the debt as of November 16, 2020 was $13.08 billion.

The purchase price consists of the issuance of approximately 689.9 million Viatris shares of common stock at a fair value of approximately $10.73 billion based on the closing price of Mylan’s ordinary shares on November 13, 2020, as reported
by the NASDAQ. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company used the acquisition method of accounting to account for this transaction. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction have been recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs of approximately $602.9 million were incurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which were recorded primarily in SG&A in the consolidated statements of operations.

The preliminary allocation of the $10.73 billion purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the Combination is as follows:

(In millions)
--------------------------------------------------------------- -------- --------
Current assets (excluding inventories and net of cash acquired) $ 2,841.9
Inventories 2,588.9
Property, plant and equipment 1,394.1
Identified intangible assets 18,040.0
Goodwill 2,107.5
Deferred income tax benefit 1,481.9
Other assets 792.1
Total assets acquired $ 29,246.4
Current liabilities 2,760.2
Long-term debt, including current portion 13,076.2
Deferred tax liabilities 1,656.9
Other noncurrent liabilities 1,441.5
Net assets acquired (net of $415.8 of cash acquired) $ 10,311.6

The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon preliminary calculations, valuations and assumptions that are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas subject to change relate to the finalization of the working capital components, the valuation of intangible and tangible assets and income taxes.

We expect that the new company will transform and accelerate each businesses’ ability to serve patients’ needs and expand their capabilities across more than 165 markets by combining two highly complementary businesses. Mylan brings a diverse portfolio across many geographies and key therapeutic areas, such as central nervous system and anesthesia, infectious disease and cardiovascular, as well as a robust pipeline, high-quality manufacturing and supply chain excellence. The Upjohn Business brings trusted, iconic brands, such as Lipitor® (atorvastatin calcium), Celebrex® (celecoxib) and Viagra® (sildenafil), and proven commercialization capabilities, including leadership positions in China and other emerging markets.

The Company recorded a step-up in the fair value of inventory of approximately $1.43 billion. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded amortization of the inventory step-up of approximately $238.2 million, which is included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, a step-up in the fair value of property, plant and equipment of approximately $390.0 million was recognized. The related depreciation is being expensed over a service life of five years for machinery and equipment and between 10 and 20 years for buildings.

The identified intangible assets of $18.04 billion are comprised of product rights and are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of 15 years. Significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of identified intangible assets were based on company specific information and projections which are not observable in the market and are thus considered Level 3 measurements as defined by U.S. GAAP. The goodwill of $2.11 billion arising from the Combination consisted largely of the value of the employee workforce and products to be sold in new markets leveraging the combined entity. The newly acquired operations have been included within each of the Company’s segments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In addition, an allocation of the goodwill was assigned to the respective segments. None of the goodwill recognized in this transaction is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The Company recorded a fair value adjustment of approximately $759.4 million related to the long-term debt assumed as part of the acquisition. The fair value of long-term debt as of the Combination date was determined by broker or dealer quotations, which is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The total fair value adjustment is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the maturity dates of the related debt instruments.
The operating results of the Upjohn Business have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date. The total revenues of the Upjohn Business for the period from the acquisition date to December 31, 2020, were $866.5 million and net loss, net of tax, was approximately $360.9 million. The net loss for the period includes the effect of the purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition related costs.

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Results

The following table presents supplemental unaudited pro forma information for the Combination, as if it had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma results reflect certain adjustments related to past operating performance and acquisition accounting adjustments, such as increased depreciation and amortization expense based on the fair value of assets acquired, the impact of transaction costs and the related income tax effects. The unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated synergies which may be achievable, or have been achieved, subsequent to the closing of the Combination. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the acquisitions been completed on the stated dates above, nor are they indicative of the future operating results of Viatris and its subsidiaries.

TOBI Purchase Agreement
On August 31, 2018, the Company completed an agreement (for purposes of this section, the “purchase agreement”) with certain subsidiaries of Novartis to purchase the worldwide rights to their global cystic fibrosis products consisting of the TOBI Podhaler® and TOBI® solution. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Novartis received fixed consideration of $463.0 million, which consisted of $240.0 million which was paid at closing, $130.0 million which was paid in August 2019 and $93.0 million which was paid in August 2020. The Company also entered into a supply agreement with Novartis to purchase the products for up to three years from the date of closing and initially recorded a liability of approximately $91.8 million related to supply obligations. Additionally, Novartis was also eligible to receive a contingent payment of up to $20.0 million if the Company did not acquire the Facility (as defined in the glossary), which the Company accrued for at closing. The Company originally accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition since the exercise of the option agreement (described below) was not deemed probable at the time of the closing of the purchase agreement and accordingly recognized an intangible asset for the product rights of $574.8 million on the closing date of the purchase agreement.

In conjunction with the purchase agreement, Mylan and Novartis entered into an option agreement pursuant to which Novartis granted Mylan an exclusive option to acquire certain equipment and employees relating to the Novartis TOBI Podhaler® production facility in San Carlos, California. The option also included the transfer of certain agreements to Mylan. On May 28, 2019, Mylan notified Novartis of its election to exercise the purchase option. As a result of the option exercise, Novartis was no longer eligible to receive the contingent payment and during the second quarter of 2019 the Company reversed the accrual for the $20.0 million contingent payment with the offset being a reduction in the value of the intangible asset.
This transaction closed in the third quarter of 2019, and the Company paid Novartis $10.0 million for the Facility. In addition, the Company received reimbursement from Novartis for certain restructuring and other costs at the Facility and has purchased the remaining inventory at closing. As a result of the option exercise and the acquisition of the Facility, the Company has accounted for these transactions as a single transaction and revised its accounting to an acquisition of a business under ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations.
The allocation of the $481.9 million purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for this business is as follows:

(In millions)
----------------------------------------------- ------ -----
Current assets $ 29.2
Property, plant and equipment 30.0
Intangible and other noncurrent assets 496.7
Total assets acquired 555.9
Current liabilities (54.0)
Long-term debt and other noncurrent obligations (20.0)
Net assets acquired $ 481.9

The identified intangible assets are comprised of product rights with a weighted average useful life of ten years. The impact of the revised accounting included a reduction of approximately $100.0 million in value of the intangible assets and liabilities related to an unfavorable supply contract and the contingent payment. Significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of identified intangible assets were based on company specific information and projections which are not observable in the market and are thus considered Level 3 measurements as defined by U.S. GAAP. The acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations since the acquisition date or on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Transactions
In December 2020, Viatris and Pfizer terminated their strategic collaboration for generic drugs in Japan pursuant to an amendment and termination agreement. Under the prior collaboration agreement, both parties contributed products, which Pfizer distributed to third-parties in the Japan market. Under the terms of the amendment and termination agreement, Viatris purchased all collaboration related inventory held by Pfizer. As a result of the termination, and the repurchase of collaboration inventory, the Company reduced revenue by $86.5 million.
In September 2020 the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the related intellectual property and commercialization rights of Aspen’s thrombosis product portfolio in Europe for €641.9 million. The portfolio consists of well-established injectable anticoagulants sold in Europe under the brand names, and variations of the brand names, Arixtra, Fraxiparine, Mono-Embolex and Orgaran. Upon closing of the transaction in November 2020, the Company made a payment of €263.2 million to Aspen with the remaining payment of €378.7 million due on June 25, 2021. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and recognized an intangible asset of €641.9 million for the product rights, which is being amortized over a useful life of 8 years.
On February 28, 2018, the Company and Revance entered into the Revance Collaboration Agreement pursuant to which the Company and Revance are collaborat exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize a biosimilar to the branded biologic product (onabotulinumtoxinA) marketed as BOTOX®.
Under the Revance Collaboration Agreement, the Company is primarily responsible for (a) clinical development activities outside of North America (excluding Japan) (the “ex-U.S. Mylan territories”), (b) regulatory activities, and (c) commercialization for any approved product. Revance is primarily responsible for (a) non-clinical development activities, (b) clinical development activities in North America, and (c) manufacturing and supply of clinical drug substance and drug product; Revance is solely responsible for an initial portion of non-clinical development costs. The remaining portion of any non-clinical development costs and clinical development costs for obtaining approval in the U.S. and Europe is shared equally between the parties, and the Company is responsible for all other clinical development costs and commercialization expenses. Upon closing, Revance received a non-refundable upfront payment of $25.0 million. In addition, under the Revance Collaboration Agreement, Revance can receive potential development milestone payments of up to $100.0 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones and potential tiered sales milestones of up to $225.0 million. In addition, Viatris will pay Revance royalties on sales of the biosimilar in the ex-U.S. Viatris territories. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition of IPR&D and the total upfront payment was expensed as a component of R&D expense during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Under the agreement, the Company had an option to terminate the program. On June 1, 2020, the Company and Revance announced a decision to continue the development program for a biosimilar to the branded biologic product (onabotulinumtoxinA) marketed as BOTOX®. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $30 million of R&D expense for a milestone payment that was due upon the decision to continue the program.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed four agreements to acquire certain intellectual property rights and marketing authorizations for products that were in the development stage, including agreements with FKB, Mapi Pharma Ltd., and Lupin Limited. The Company also completed the acquisition of intellectual property rights and marketing authorizations related to a commercialized product in certain rest of world markets for $220.0 million, of which $160.0 million was paid at closing, $20.0 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the remaining amount was paid in the second quarter of 2019. The Company is accounting for these transactions as asset acquisitions and a useful life of five years is being used to amortize the asset related to the commercialized product. The Company recorded expense of approximately $53.7 million as a component of R&D expense related to non-refundable upfront payments for agreements for products in development during the year ended December 31, 2018. Certain of the agreements include additional development and commercial milestones.
On February 22, 2018, the Company in-licensed European rights to Hulio™, a biosimilar to AbbVie’s Humira® (adalimumab), including a sub-license to certain of AbbVie’s European patents, from FKB. On February 27, 2019, the Company updated its arrangements with FKB for the commercialization of Hulio™. Under the updated arrangements, Mylan has in-licensed exclusive global commercialization rights for Hulio™. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition of IPR&D and a net non-contingent amount paid to FKB of approximately $23.3 million was expensed as a component of R&D expense during the year ended December 31, 2019.
On December 1, 2018, the Company and certain subsidiaries of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited entered into an agreement for Mylan to distribute a portfolio of prescription and OTC products in Australia and New Zealand. The agreement included an option for Mylan to purchase the rights to the portfolio. In March 2019, the Company exercised the option, and acquired the product rights in the second quarter of 2019 for approximately $130.9 million. The purchase consideration of approximately $130.9 million included a payment made at closing of approximately $64.3 million and a payment made in 2020 totaling approximately $66.6 million.
The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and recognized an intangible asset for the product rights of approximately $130.9 million. The intangible asset is being amortized over a useful life of five years.
The Company has entered into certain agreements to acquire intellectual property rights for products that are in the development stage. These agreements include additional development and commercial milestones. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded expense of approximately $56.1 million as a component of R&D expense related to non-refundable upfront and milestone payments during the year.

Accounts Receivable Factoring Arrangements
We have entered into accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our non-U.S. accounts receivable. These transactions are accounted for as sales and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. Our factoring agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility, and we do not retain any interest in the underlying accounts receivable once sold. We derecognized $153.0 million and $90.1 million of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 under these factoring arrangements, respectively.

 Leases
The Company has operating leases of real estate, consisting primarily of administrative offices, manufacturing and distribution facilities, and R&D facilities. We also have operating leases of certain equipment, primarily automobiles, and certain limited supply arrangements.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a ROU asset of $323.6 million and a total lease liability of $322.4 million. The Company’s ROU assets are recorded in other assets. The related lease liability balances are recorded in other current liabilities and other long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 Balance Sheet Components for additional information.
ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an applicable incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Options to extend or terminate the ROU assets are reviewed at lease inception and these options are accounted for when they are reasonably certain of being exercised.
Other information related to leases was as follows:

 Equity Method InvestmentsThe Company currently has three equity method investments in limited liability companies that own refined coal production plants whose activities qualify for income tax credits under Section 45 of the Code. The Company does not consolidate these entities as we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities and do not have the power to individually direct the activities of these entities. Accordingly, these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For each of the clean energy investments, the Company has entered into notes payable with the respective project sponsor, which in part will be paid to the sponsor as certain production levels are met. The Company’s clean energy investments will wind down upon the expiration of the refined coal tax credit at the end of 2021.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company reduced its long-term obligations for its three investments as a result of lower than anticipated production levels and lower expected future variable debt payments to the respective project sponsor. The Company recognized a net gain of approximately $21.4 million and $7.0 million, respectively, which was recognized as a component of the net loss of the equity method investments in the consolidated statements of operations.
The carrying values and respective balance sheet locations of the Company’s clean energy investments were as follows at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively:

Amortization expense and intangible asset impairment charges, which are included as a component of amortization expense, which is classified primarily within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:

Year ended December 31,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ------- ----- ------- - -------
(In millions) 2020 2019 2018
Intangible asset amortization expense $ 1,605.8 $ 1,582.7 $ 1,606.4
IPR&D intangible asset impairment charges 37.4 138.3 117.7
Finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges 45.0 42.3 106.3
Total intangible asset amortization expense (including impairment charges) $ 1,688.2 $ 1,763.3 $ 1,830.4

The assessment for impairment of finite-lived intangibles is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets or asset grouping by analyzing the expected future undiscounted pre-tax cash flows specific to the asset or asset grouping. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows.
Significant management judgment is involved in estimating the recoverability of these assets and is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates, as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific asset or asset grouping. The fair value of finite-lived intangible assets was calculated as the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using a market rate of return. The assumptions inherent in the estimated future cash flows include, among other things, the impact of the current competitive environment and future market expectations. Discount rates ranging between 9.0% and 11.0% were utilized in the valuations performed during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets totaled $29.60 billion and $11.53 billion, respectively. Any future long-lived assets impairment charges could have a material impact in the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s IPR&D assets are tested at least annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Impairment is determined to exist when the fair value of IPR&D assets, which is based upon updated forecasts and commercial development plans, is less than the carrying value of the assets being tested. The fair value of IPR&D was calculated as the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using a market rate of return. The assumptions inherent in the estimated future cash flows include, among other things, the impact of changes to the development programs, the projected development and regulatory time frames and the current competitive environment. Discount rates ranging between 9.0% and 11.0%, 9.0% and 11.0%, and 9.5% and 13.0% were utilized in the valuations performed during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.
The fair value of both IPR&D and finite-lived intangible assets was determined based upon detailed valuations employing the income approach which utilized Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 9 Financial Instruments and Risk Management. Changes to any of the Company’s assumptions including changes to or abandonment of development programs,
regulatory timelines, discount rates or the competitive environment related to the assets could lead to future material impairment charges.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on April 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. As a result of the decline in the Mylan share price during the first quarter of 2020, and the general uncertainty and volatility in the economic environments in which the Company operates, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020. The Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2020. There were no significant changes from the interim goodwill test performed at March 31, 2020 and the results were consistent with the interim goodwill impairment test.
Mylan performed both the interim and annual goodwill impairment tests on a quantitative basis for its four reporting units, North America Generics, North America Brands, Europe and Rest of World. In estimating each reporting unit’s fair value, Mylan performed an extensive valuation analysis, utilizing both income and market-based approaches, except for the North America Brands reporting unit where the fair value was estimated utilizing the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit’s expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions, utilizing Level 3 inputs, primarily include, but are not limited to, market multiples, control premiums, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts.
As of March 31, 2020 and April 1, 2020, the allocation of the goodwill among the reporting units was as follows: North America Generics $2.60 billion, North America Brands $0.65 billion, Europe $4.43 billion and Rest of World $1.65 billion.
As of March 31, 2020 and April 1, 2020, Mylan determined that the fair value of the North America Generics, North America Brands and Rest of World reporting units was substantially in excess of the respective unit’s carrying value. However, when compared to the April 1, 2019 test, the fair value of the overall business declined because of future forecasts and the decline in share price.
For the Europe reporting unit, the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately $1.2 billion or 11.0% for both the interim and annual goodwill impairment test. As it relates to the income approach for the Europe reporting unit at March 31, 2020 and April 1, 2020, the Company forecasted cash flows for the next 5 years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately 7.5%. A terminal year value was calculated with a 2.0% revenue growth rate applied. The discount rate utilized was 11.0% and the estimated tax rate was 25.5%. Under the market-based approach, we utilized an estimated range of market multiples of 8.0 to 9.5 times EBITDA plus a control premium of 15.0%. If all other assumptions are held constant, a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by 3.5% or an increase in discount rate by 3.5% would result in an impairment charge for the Europe reporting unit.

Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, changes in underlying assumptions, especially as it relates to the key assumptions detailed, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units.
Intangible asset amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 through 2025 is estimated to be as follows:

 Financial Instruments and Risk Management
The Company is exposed to certain financial risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The primary financial risks that are managed by using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
Foreign Currency Risk Management
In order to manage certain foreign currency risks, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate risk associated with changes in spot exchange rates of mainly non-functional currency denominated assets or liabilities. The foreign exchange forward contracts are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Any gains or losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the period incurred in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company has also entered into forward contracts to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated sales from certain international subsidiaries. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges to manage foreign currency transaction risk and are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Any changes in the fair value of designated cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCE and are reclassified into earnings when the hedged item impacts earnings.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company may hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries by either borrowing directly in foreign currencies and designating all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or entering into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments.
The Company has designated certain Euro borrowings as a hedge of its investment in certain Euro-functional currency subsidiaries in order to manage foreign currency translation risk. Borrowings designated as net investment hedges are marked-to-market using the current spot exchange rate as of the end of the period, with gains and losses included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCE until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investments. In addition, the Company manages the related foreign exchange risk of the Euro borrowings not designated as net investment hedges through certain Euro denominated financial assets and forward currency swaps.
The following table summarizes the principal amounts of the Company’s outstanding Euro borrowings and the notional amounts of the Euro borrowings designated as net investment hedges:

Total € 6,705.6 € 5,955.6 € 2,354.0

Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company enters into interest rate swaps from time to time in order to manage interest rate risk associated with the Company’s fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. All derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the underlying debt obligations are included in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is deferred through AOCE and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged item impacts earnings.
Cash Flow Hedging Relationships
The Company’s interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges fix the interest rate on a portion of the Company’s variable-rate debt or hedge part of the Company’s interest rate exposure associated with the variability in the future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates. Any changes in fair value are included in earnings or deferred through AOCE, depending on the nature and effectiveness of the offset. Any ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedging relationship is recognized immediately in earnings in the consolidated statements of operations.
Fair Value Hedging Relationships
The Company's interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges convert the fixed rate on a portion of the Company's fixed-rate senior notes to a variable rate. Any changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments, as well as the offsetting change in fair value of the portion of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, is included in interest expense. The total notional amount of the Company’s fair value hedge was $750 million as of December 31, 2019 and terminated during 2020.
Credit Risk Management
The Company regularly reviews the creditworthiness of its financial counterparties and does not expect to incur a significant loss from the failure of any counterparties to perform under any agreements. The Company is not subject to any obligations to post collateral under derivative instrument contracts. Certain derivative instrument contracts entered into by the Company are governed by master agreements, which contain credit-risk-related contingent features that would allow the counterparties to terminate the contracts early and request immediate payment should the Company trigger an event of default on other specified borrowings. The Company records all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets. Accordingly, there are no offsetting amounts that net assets against liabilities.

Fair Value Measurement
Fair value is based on the price that would be received from the sale of an identical asset or paid to transfer an identical liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below:
Level 1:        Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.
Level 2:        Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 3:        Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.
In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value.
Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified in the tables below in one of the three categories described above:

For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including the LIBOR yield curve, foreign exchange forward prices, and bank price quotes. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets and liabilities:
•Cash equivalents — valued at observable net asset value prices.
•Equity securities, exchange traded funds — valued at the active quoted market prices from broker or dealer quotations or transparent pricing sources at the reporting date. Unrealized gains and losses attributable to changes in fair value are included in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations.
•Equity securities, marketable securities — valued using quoted stock prices from public exchanges at the reporting date. Unrealized gains and losses attributable to changes in fair value are included in other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations.
•Available-for-sale fixed income investments — valued at the quoted market prices from broker or dealer quotations or transparent pricing sources at the reporting date. Unrealized gains and losses attributable to changes in fair value, net of income taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of shareholders’ equity.
•Interest rate swap derivative assets and liabilities — valued using the LIBOR/EURIBOR yield curves at the reporting date. Counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions.
•Foreign exchange derivative assets and liabilities — valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices and spot rates at the reporting date. Counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions.
Contingent Consideration
In December 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline’s Advair® Diskus incorporating Pfizer’s respiratory delivery platform. The Company accounted for this transaction as a purchase of a business and utilized the acquisition method of accounting. On January 30, 2019, the Company received FDA approval of WixelaTM InhubTM (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder, USP), the first generic of GlaxoSmithKline’s Advair Diskus®. The commercial launch of the WixelaTM InhubTM occurred in February 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has a contingent consideration liability of $204.9 million related to the respiratory delivery platform. The fair value measurement of contingent consideration is determined using Level 3 inputs. The Company’s contingent consideration represents a component of the total purchase consideration for Pfizer’s respiratory delivery platform and certain other acquisitions. The measurement is calculated using unobservable inputs based on the Company’s own assumptions primarily related to the probability and timing of future development and commercial milestones and future profit sharing payments which are discounted using a market rate of return. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, discount rates ranging from 2.1% to 10.5% were utilized in the valuations. Significant changes in unobservable inputs could result in material changes to the contingent consideration liability.
A rollforward of the activity in the Company’s fair value of contingent consideration from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2020 is as follows:

(In millions) Current Portion (1) Long-Term Portion (2) Total Contingent Consideration

2019 Changes to Contingent Consideration: During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a fair value gain of $20.4 million related to the respiratory delivery platform contingent consideration which was partially offset by the net accretion of approximately $14.8 million. In addition, the Company made payments of approximately $99.0 million related to the respiratory delivery platform contingent consideration.
2020 Changes to Contingent Consideration: During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a fair value loss of $73.1 million related to the respiratory delivery platform contingent consideration and accretion of approximately $11.6 million. In addition, the Company made payments of approximately $111.8 million related to the respiratory delivery platform contingent consideration.
The Company expects to incur approximately $8 million to $10 million of non-cash accretion expense related to the increase in the net present value of the contingent consideration liabilities in 2021.
Although the Company has not elected the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities, any future transacted financial asset or liability will be evaluated for the fair value election.

 The following provides an overview of the Company’s short-term credit facilities.
Commercial Paper Program
On November 16, 2020, the Company established the Commercial Paper Program to support its working capital requirements and for general purposes. This program replaced a similar program at Mylan. There was $651.3 million of CP Notes outstanding under this program as of December 31, 2020 and no balance as of December 31, 2019. Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time, with the aggregate principal amount of CP Notes outstanding at any time not to exceed $1.65 billion. The Revolving Facility will be available to pay the CP Notes, if necessary. The maturities of the CP Notes will vary but will not exceed 364 days from the date of issue.
Receivables Facility and Note Securitization Facility
The Company has a $400 million Receivables Facility which expires in April 2022.
Under the terms of the Receivables Facility, our subsidiary, MPI, sells certain accounts receivable to Mylan Securitization, a wholly-owned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. Mylan Securitization’s assets have been pledged to MUFG Bank, Ltd., as agent, in support of its obligations under the Receivables Facility. Any amounts outstanding under the facility are recorded as borrowings and the underlying receivables are included in accounts receivable, net, in the consolidated balance sheets.
In August 2020, the Company entered into the Note Securitization Facility for borrowings up to $200 million. Under the terms of each of the Receivables Facility and Note Securitization Facility, certain of our accounts receivable secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities. The amount that we may borrow at a given point in time is determined based on the amount of qualifying accounts receivable that are present at such point in time. Borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Facility bear interest at a commercial paper rate plus 0.925% and under the Note Securitization Facility at a rate per annum quoted from time to time by MUFG Bank, Ltd. plus 1.00% and are included as a component of short-term borrowings, while the accounts receivable securing these obligations remain as a component of accounts receivable, net, in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the agreements governing the Receivables Facility and Note Securitization Facility contain various customary affirmative and negative covenants, and customary default and termination provisions with which the Company was compliant as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $389.4 million and $407.0 million, respectively, of accounts receivable balances sold to Mylan Securitization.

['s reporting units as compared to their related carrying value. Under the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to use qualitative factors and determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the goodwill impairment test would be required. The goodwill impairment test requires the Company to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount is less than its fair value, then no impairment is recognized. If the carrying amount recorded exceeds the fair value calculated, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The judgments made in determining the projected cash flows used to estimate the fair value can materially impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
Indefinite-lived intangibles, principally IPR&D, are tested at least annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The impairment test for IPR&D consists of a comparison of the asset’s fair value with its carrying value. Impairment is determined to exist when the fair value of IPR&D assets, which is based upon updated forecasts and commercial development plans, is less than the carrying value of the assets being tested.

Contingent Consideration. Viatris records contingent consideration resulting from business acquisitions at its estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafter, the Company revalues these obligations and records increases or decreases in their fair value as adjustments to litigation settlements and other contingencies, net within the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to the discount rates, payment periods and adjustments in the probability of achieving future development steps, regulatory approvals, market launches, sales targets and profitability. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements as they are based on significant inputs not observable in the market.
Significant judgment is employed in determining the assumptions utilized as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent measurement period. Accordingly, changes in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The carrying values of long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives, are evaluated periodically in relation to the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets and monitored for other potential triggering events. The assessment for impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets or asset grouping by analyzing the expected future undiscounted pre-tax cash flows specific to the asset or asset grouping. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows.
Significant management judgment is involved in estimating the recoverability of these assets and is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates, as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific asset or asset grouping. Any future long-lived assets impairment charges could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
 Short-Term Borrowings. The Company’s subsidiaries in India have working capital facilities with several banks which are secured by its current assets. MPI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, also has the CP Notes, Receivables Facility, which will expire in April 2022 and the Note Securitization Facility. Under the terms of each of the Receivables Facility and Note Securitization Facility, certain of our accounts receivable secure the amounts borrowed and cannot be used to pay our other debts or liabilities. As the accounts receivable do not transfer to the banks, any amounts outstanding under the facilities are recorded as borrowings and the underlying receivables continue to be included in accounts receivable, net, in the consolidated balance sheets.
 Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenues in accordance with ASC 606. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes net revenue for product sales when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for variable consideration, including discounts, rebates, governmental rebate programs, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, promotional programs and other sales allowances. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions in determining net sales and as a contra asset in accounts receivable, net (if settled via credit) and other current liabilities (if paid in cash). Amounts recorded for revenue deductions can result from a complex series of judgements about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The following section briefly describes the nature of our provisions for variable consideration and how such provisions are estimated:
•Chargebacks: the Company has agreements with certain indirect customers, such as independent pharmacies, retail pharmacy chains, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers, which establish contract prices for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers that establish contract pricing for certain products, which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Viatris will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler’s invoice price. Such credits are called chargebacks. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels.
•Rebates, promotional programs and other sales allowances: this category includes rebate and other programs to assist in product sales. These programs generally provide that the customer receives credit directly related to the amount of purchases or credits upon the attainment of pre-established volumes. Also included in this category are prompt pay discounts, administrative fees and price adjustments to reflect decreases in the selling prices of products.
•Returns: consistent with industry practice, Viatris maintains a return policy that allows customers to return a product, which varies country by country in accordance with local practices, generally within a specified period prior (six months) and subsequent (twelve months) to the expiration date. The Company’s estimate of the provision for returns is generally based upon historical experience with actual returns. Generally, returned products are destroyed and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.
•Governmental rebate programs: government reimbursement programs in the U.S. include Medicare, Medicaid, and State Pharmacy Assistance Programs established according to statute, regulations and policy. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products that are covered by the Medicaid program are required to pay rebates to each state based on a statutory formula set forth in the Social Security Act. Medicare beneficiaries are eligible to obtain discounted prescription drug coverage from private sector providers. In addition, certain states have also implemented supplemental rebate programs that obligate manufacturers to pay rebates in excess of those required under federal law. Our estimate of these rebates is based on the historical trends of rebates paid as well as on changes in wholesaler inventory levels and increases or decreases in the level of sales. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare “coverage gap” based on historical experience of prescriptions and utilization expected to result in the discount of the “coverage gap”.
Outside the U.S. the majority of our pharmaceutical sales are contractually or legislatively governed. In certain European countries, certain rebates are calculated on the governments total pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sale thresholds. We utilize historical data and obtain third party information to determine the adequacy of these accruals. Also, this provision includes price reductions that are mandated by law outside of the U.S.
Our net sales may be impacted by wholesaler and distributor inventory levels of our products, which can fluctuate throughout the year due to the seasonality of certain products, pricing, the timing of product demand, purchasing decisions and other factors. Such fluctuations may impact the comparability of our net sales between periods.Consideration received from licenses of intellectual property is recorded as other revenues. Royalty or profit share amounts, which are based on sales of licensed products or technology, are recorded when the customer’s subsequent sales or usages occur. Such consideration is included in other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.
 Research and Development. R&D expenses are charged to operations as incurred.
 Income Taxes. Income taxes have been provided for using an asset and liability approach in which deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of events that the Company has already recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. Changes in enacted tax rates or laws may result in adjustments to the recorded tax assets or liabilities in the period that the new tax law is enacted.

Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to holders of Viatris Inc. common stock by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to holders of Viatris Inc. common stock by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding related to potentially dilutive securities or instruments, if the impact is dilutive.
Mylan was authorized to repurchase up to $1 billion of its ordinary shares under its repurchase program that was previously approved by the Mylan’s board of directors and announced on November 16, 2015, but was not obligated to acquire
any particular amount of ordinary shares. In 2018, Mylan repurchased approximately 9.8 million of ordinary shares at a cost of approximately $432.0 million.

 Share-Based Compensation. The fair value of share-based compensation is recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period.
 Derivatives. From time to time the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments (mainly foreign currency exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and purchased equity call options) designed to: 1) hedge the cash flows resulting from existing assets and liabilities and transactions expected to be entered into over the next 24 months in currencies other than the functional currency, 2) hedge the variability in interest expense on floating rate debt, 3) hedge the fair value of fixed-rate notes, 4) hedge against changes in interest rates that could impact future debt issuances, 5) hedge cash or share payments required on conversion of issued convertible notes, 6) hedge a net investment in a foreign operation, or 7) economically hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with the purchase price of non-U.S. acquisitions. Derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. When the derivative instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value are deferred through other comprehensive earnings. If a derivative instrument qualifies as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged items, are generally included in interest expense. When such instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting the changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations within other expense, net

Financial Instruments. The Company’s financial instruments consist primarily of short-term and long-term debt, interest rate swaps, forward contracts and option contracts. The Company’s financial instruments also include cash and cash equivalents as well as accounts and other receivables and accounts payable, the fair values of which approximate their carrying values. As a policy, the Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging foreign currency and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations, or to hedge cash, and have been used to hedge share payments required on conversion of issued convertible notes. The Company carries derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, determined by reference to market data such as forward rates for currencies, implied volatilities, and interest rate swap yield curves. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. In addition, the Company has designated certain long-term debt instruments as net investment hedges.
Fair value is based on the price that would be received from the sale of an identical asset or paid to transfer an identical liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below:
Level 1:        Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.
Level 2:        Observable market-based inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 3:        Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, as well as considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value

Recent Accounting Pronouncements.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards and Amended SEC Rules
In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief (“ASU 2019-05”). ASU 2019-05 provides transition relief for ASU 2016-13 by providing entities with an alternative to irrevocably elect the fair value option for eligible financial assets measured at amortized cost upon adoption of ASU 2016-13. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2016-13 and its subsequent revisions as of January 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-03”), which adds to and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements including a requirement to disclose changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements and a requirement to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2018-13 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”). The objective of this update is to clarify and align the accounting and capitalization of implementation costs for hosting arrangements, regardless of whether they convey a license to the hosted software. The updated guidance will require an entity in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract, to follow guidance in ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset and which costs to expense. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2018-15 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In November 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808)—Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 (“ASU 2018-18”). The amendments in ASU 2018-18 make targeted improvements to U.S. GAAP for collaborative arrangements by clarifying that certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue under Topic 606 when the collaborative arrangement participant is a customer in the context of a unit of account. In those situations, all the guidance in Topic 606 should be applied, including recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements. In addition, unit-of-account guidance in Topic 808 was aligned with the guidance in Topic 606 (that is, a distinct good or service) when an entity is assessing whether the collaborative arrangement or a part of the arrangement is within the scope of Topic 606. The Company applied the provisions of ASU 2018-18 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2020, the SEC amended Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X regarding the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered. Among other things, the amendments narrow the circumstances that require separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors and streamline the alternative disclosures required in lieu of those financial statements. The effective date of the amendment is January 4, 2021 with earlier voluntary compliance permitted. We have chosen to voluntarily comply with the amended rules effective during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and have included the required disclosures as a component of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K as permitted by the amendments.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which supersedes FASB Topic 840, Leases (Topic 840) and provides principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-
line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a ROU asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than twelve months regardless of classification. Leases with a term of twelve months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases. The Company adopted the provisions of Topic 842 as of January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis applying the guidance to leases existing as of this effective date. We elected to apply the available package of transitional practical expedients which permitted us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions regarding lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We have also elected to apply the short-term lease recognition exemption which means we will not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases that qualify both at transition and on a go-forward basis. In addition, we have elected to apply the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for our leases except for those related to certain limited supply arrangements. We will continue to report periods prior to January 1, 2019 in our financial statements under prior guidance as outlined in Topic 840. Upon adoption of Topic 842, the Company determined that there was no cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 6 Leases for additional information.
In June 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. The changes took effect for the Company as of January 1, 2019. The impact of the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-14, Compensation-Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (“ASU 2018-14”). ASU 2018-14 removes certain disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures and added additional disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption in any interim period permitted. The amendments in ASU 2018-14 would need to be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s disclosures.
    Accounting Standards Issued Not Yet Adopted
In January 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-01, Clarifying the Interactions Between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815 (“ASU 2020-01”), which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the measurement alternative in accordance with Topic 321 immediately before applying or upon discontinuing the equity method. In addition, ASU 2020-01 states that for the purpose of applying paragraph 815-10-15-141(a) an entity should not consider whether, upon the settlement of the forward contract or exercise of the purchased option, individually or with existing investments, the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method in Topic 323 or the fair value option in accordance with the financial instruments guidance in Topic 825. ASU 2020-01 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption in any interim period permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 applies only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Entities can apply the provisions of ASU 2020-04 immediately, as applicable, and generally the provisions of the guidance are available through December 31, 2022 as entities transition away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) which is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions and simplifying certain requirements under Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption in any interim period permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

 Acquisitions and Other Transactions
Upjohn Business Combination Agreement
On July 29, 2019, Mylan, Pfizer, Upjohn Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer, and certain other affiliated entities entered into a Business Combination Agreement pursuant to which the Company would combine with the Upjohn Business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. The Upjohn Business was a global, primarily off-patent branded and generic established medicines business, which includes 20 primarily off-patent solid oral dose legacy brands, such as Lyrica, Lipitor, Celebrex and Viagra. The Combination was completed on November 16, 2020.
Prior to the Combination and pursuant to a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Pfizer had, among other things, transferred to Viatris substantially all of the assets and liabilities comprising the Upjohn Business (the Separation) and, thereafter, Pfizer had distributed to Pfizer stockholders all of the issued and outstanding shares of Viatris (the Distribution). When the Distribution and Combination were complete, Pfizer stockholders as of the record date of the Distribution owned 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock and Mylan shareholders as of immediately before the Combination owned 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted basis. Viatris also made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12 billion, which was funded with the proceeds of debt incurred by Upjohn prior to the Combination.
The transaction involved multiple legal entity restructuring transactions and a reverse merger acquisition with Viatris representing the legal acquirer and Mylan representing the accounting acquirer of the Upjohn Business. In accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, Mylan is considered the accounting acquirer of the Upjohn Business and Viatris applied purchase accounting to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the Upjohn Business as of November 16, 2020. The debt incurred by Upjohn prior to the Combination was a liability assumed in purchase accounting. The fair value of the debt as of November 16, 2020 was $13.08 billion.

The purchase price consists of the issuance of approximately 689.9 million Viatris shares of common stock at a fair value of approximately $10.73 billion based on the closing price of Mylan’s ordinary shares on November 13, 2020, as reported
by the NASDAQ. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company used the acquisition method of accounting to account for this transaction. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction have been recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs of approximately $602.9 million were incurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which were recorded primarily in SG&A in the consolidated statements of operations.

The preliminary allocation of the $10.73 billion purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the Combination is as follows:

(In millions)
--------------------------------------------------------------- -------- --------
Current assets (excluding inventories and net of cash acquired) $ 2,841.9
Inventories 2,588.9
Property, plant and equipment 1,394.1
Identified intangible assets 18,040.0
Goodwill 2,107.5
Deferred income tax benefit 1,481.9
Other assets 792.1
Total assets acquired $ 29,246.4
Current liabilities 2,760.2
Long-term debt, including current portion 13,076.2
Deferred tax liabilities 1,656.9
Other noncurrent liabilities 1,441.5
Net assets acquired (net of $415.8 of cash acquired) $ 10,311.6

The preliminary fair value estimates for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were based upon preliminary calculations, valuations and assumptions that are subject to change as the Company obtains additional information during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The primary areas subject to change relate to the finalization of the working capital components, the valuation of intangible and tangible assets and income taxes.

We expect that the new company will transform and accelerate each businesses’ ability to serve patients’ needs and expand their capabilities across more than 165 markets by combining two highly complementary businesses. Mylan brings a diverse portfolio across many geographies and key therapeutic areas, such as central nervous system and anesthesia, infectious disease and cardiovascular, as well as a robust pipeline, high-quality manufacturing and supply chain excellence. The Upjohn Business brings trusted, iconic brands, such as Lipitor® (atorvastatin calcium), Celebrex® (celecoxib) and Viagra® (sildenafil), and proven commercialization capabilities, including leadership positions in China and other emerging markets.

The Company recorded a step-up in the fair value of inventory of approximately $1.43 billion. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded amortization of the inventory step-up of approximately $238.2 million, which is included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, a step-up in the fair value of property, plant and equipment of approximately $390.0 million was recognized. The related depreciation is being expensed over a service life of five years for machinery and equipment and between 10 and 20 years for buildings.

The identified intangible assets of $18.04 billion are comprised of product rights and are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of 15 years. Significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of identified intangible assets were based on company specific information and projections which are not observable in the market and are thus considered Level 3 measurements as defined by U.S. GAAP. The goodwill of $2.11 billion arising from the Combination consisted largely of the value of the employee workforce and products to be sold in new markets leveraging the combined entity. The newly acquired operations have been included within each of the Company’s segments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. In addition, an allocation of the goodwill was assigned to the respective segments. None of the goodwill recognized in this transaction is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The Company recorded a fair value adjustment of approximately $759.4 million related to the long-term debt assumed as part of the acquisition. The fair value of long-term debt as of the Combination date was determined by broker or dealer quotations, which is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The total fair value adjustment is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the maturity dates of the related debt instruments.
The operating results of the Upjohn Business have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date. The total revenues of the Upjohn Business for the period from the acquisition date to December 31, 2020, were $866.5 million and net loss, net of tax, was approximately $360.9 million. The net loss for the period includes the effect of the purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition related costs.

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Results

The following table presents supplemental unaudited pro forma information for the Combination, as if it had occurred on January 1, 2019. The unaudited pro forma results reflect certain adjustments related to past operating performance and acquisition accounting adjustments, such as increased depreciation and amortization expense based on the fair value of assets acquired, the impact of transaction costs and the related income tax effects. The unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated synergies which may be achievable, or have been achieved, subsequent to the closing of the Combination. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the acquisitions been completed on the stated dates above, nor are they indicative of the future operating results of Viatris and its subsidiaries.

TOBI Purchase Agreement
On August 31, 2018, the Company completed an agreement (for purposes of this section, the “purchase agreement”) with certain subsidiaries of Novartis to purchase the worldwide rights to their global cystic fibrosis products consisting of the TOBI Podhaler® and TOBI® solution. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Novartis received fixed consideration of $463.0 million, which consisted of $240.0 million which was paid at closing, $130.0 million which was paid in August 2019 and $93.0 million which was paid in August 2020. The Company also entered into a supply agreement with Novartis to purchase the products for up to three years from the date of closing and initially recorded a liability of approximately $91.8 million related to supply obligations. Additionally, Novartis was also eligible to receive a contingent payment of up to $20.0 million if the Company did not acquire the Facility (as defined in the glossary), which the Company accrued for at closing. The Company originally accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition since the exercise of the option agreement (described below) was not deemed probable at the time of the closing of the purchase agreement and accordingly recognized an intangible asset for the product rights of $574.8 million on the closing date of the purchase agreement.

In conjunction with the purchase agreement, Mylan and Novartis entered into an option agreement pursuant to which Novartis granted Mylan an exclusive option to acquire certain equipment and employees relating to the Novartis TOBI Podhaler® production facility in San Carlos, California. The option also included the transfer of certain agreements to Mylan. On May 28, 2019, Mylan notified Novartis of its election to exercise the purchase option. As a result of the option exercise, Novartis was no longer eligible to receive the contingent payment and during the second quarter of 2019 the Company reversed the accrual for the $20.0 million contingent payment with the offset being a reduction in the value of the intangible asset.
This transaction closed in the third quarter of 2019, and the Company paid Novartis $10.0 million for the Facility. In addition, the Company received reimbursement from Novartis for certain restructuring and other costs at the Facility and has purchased the remaining inventory at closing. As a result of the option exercise and the acquisition of the Facility, the Company has accounted for these transactions as a single transaction and revised its accounting to an acquisition of a business under ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations.
The allocation of the $481.9 million purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for this business is as follows:

(In millions)
----------------------------------------------- ------ -----
Current assets $ 29.2
Property, plant and equipment 30.0
Intangible and other noncurrent assets 496.7
Total assets acquired 555.9
Current liabilities (54.0)
Long-term debt and other noncurrent obligations (20.0)
Net assets acquired $ 481.9

The identified intangible assets are comprised of product rights with a weighted average useful life of ten years. The impact of the revised accounting included a reduction of approximately $100.0 million in value of the intangible assets and liabilities related to an unfavorable supply contract and the contingent payment. Significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of identified intangible assets were based on company specific information and projections which are not observable in the market and are thus considered Level 3 measurements as defined by U.S. GAAP. The acquisition did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations since the acquisition date or on a pro forma basis for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Other Transactions
In December 2020, Viatris and Pfizer terminated their strategic collaboration for generic drugs in Japan pursuant to an amendment and termination agreement. Under the prior collaboration agreement, both parties contributed products, which Pfizer distributed to third-parties in the Japan market. Under the terms of the amendment and termination agreement, Viatris purchased all collaboration related inventory held by Pfizer. As a result of the termination, and the repurchase of collaboration inventory, the Company reduced revenue by $86.5 million.
In September 2020 the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the related intellectual property and commercialization rights of Aspen’s thrombosis product portfolio in Europe for €641.9 million. The portfolio consists of well-established injectable anticoagulants sold in Europe under the brand names, and variations of the brand names, Arixtra, Fraxiparine, Mono-Embolex and Orgaran. Upon closing of the transaction in November 2020, the Company made a payment of €263.2 million to Aspen with the remaining payment of €378.7 million due on June 25, 2021. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and recognized an intangible asset of €641.9 million for the product rights, which is being amortized over a useful life of 8 years.
On February 28, 2018, the Company and Revance entered into the Revance Collaboration Agreement pursuant to which the Company and Revance are collaborat exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize a biosimilar to the branded biologic product (onabotulinumtoxinA) marketed as BOTOX®.
Under the Revance Collaboration Agreement, the Company is primarily responsible for (a) clinical development activities outside of North America (excluding Japan) (the “ex-U.S. Mylan territories”), (b) regulatory activities, and (c) commercialization for any approved product. Revance is primarily responsible for (a) non-clinical development activities, (b) clinical development activities in North America, and (c) manufacturing and supply of clinical drug substance and drug product; Revance is solely responsible for an initial portion of non-clinical development costs. The remaining portion of any non-clinical development costs and clinical development costs for obtaining approval in the U.S. and Europe is shared equally between the parties, and the Company is responsible for all other clinical development costs and commercialization expenses. Upon closing, Revance received a non-refundable upfront payment of $25.0 million. In addition, under the Revance Collaboration Agreement, Revance can receive potential development milestone payments of up to $100.0 million, in the aggregate, upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones and potential tiered sales milestones of up to $225.0 million. In addition, Viatris will pay Revance royalties on sales of the biosimilar in the ex-U.S. Viatris territories. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition of IPR&D and the total upfront payment was expensed as a component of R&D expense during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Under the agreement, the Company had an option to terminate the program. On June 1, 2020, the Company and Revance announced a decision to continue the development program for a biosimilar to the branded biologic product (onabotulinumtoxinA) marketed as BOTOX®. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $30 million of R&D expense for a milestone payment that was due upon the decision to continue the program.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed four agreements to acquire certain intellectual property rights and marketing authorizations for products that were in the development stage, including agreements with FKB, Mapi Pharma Ltd., and Lupin Limited. The Company also completed the acquisition of intellectual property rights and marketing authorizations related to a commercialized product in certain rest of world markets for $220.0 million, of which $160.0 million was paid at closing, $20.0 million was paid in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the remaining amount was paid in the second quarter of 2019. The Company is accounting for these transactions as asset acquisitions and a useful life of five years is being used to amortize the asset related to the commercialized product. The Company recorded expense of approximately $53.7 million as a component of R&D expense related to non-refundable upfront payments for agreements for products in development during the year ended December 31, 2018. Certain of the agreements include additional development and commercial milestones.
On February 22, 2018, the Company in-licensed European rights to Hulio™, a biosimilar to AbbVie’s Humira® (adalimumab), including a sub-license to certain of AbbVie’s European patents, from FKB. On February 27, 2019, the Company updated its arrangements with FKB for the commercialization of Hulio™. Under the updated arrangements, Mylan has in-licensed exclusive global commercialization rights for Hulio™. The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition of IPR&D and a net non-contingent amount paid to FKB of approximately $23.3 million was expensed as a component of R&D expense during the year ended December 31, 2019.
On December 1, 2018, the Company and certain subsidiaries of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited entered into an agreement for Mylan to distribute a portfolio of prescription and OTC products in Australia and New Zealand. The agreement included an option for Mylan to purchase the rights to the portfolio. In March 2019, the Company exercised the option, and acquired the product rights in the second quarter of 2019 for approximately $130.9 million. The purchase consideration of approximately $130.9 million included a payment made at closing of approximately $64.3 million and a payment made in 2020 totaling approximately $66.6 million.
The Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition and recognized an intangible asset for the product rights of approximately $130.9 million. The intangible asset is being amortized over a useful life of five years.
The Company has entered into certain agreements to acquire intellectual property rights for products that are in the development stage. These agreements include additional development and commercial milestones. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded expense of approximately $56.1 million as a component of R&D expense related to non-refundable upfront and milestone payments during the year.

Approximately 12% and 21% of the accounts receivable balances represent amounts due from three customers at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
Accounts Receivable Factoring Arrangements
We have entered into accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our non-U.S. accounts receivable. These transactions are accounted for as sales and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. Our factoring agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility, and we do not retain any interest in the underlying accounts receivable once sold. We derecognized $153.0 million and $90.1 million of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 under these factoring arrangements, respectively.

 Leases
The Company has operating leases of real estate, consisting primarily of administrative offices, manufacturing and distribution facilities, and R&D facilities. We also have operating leases of certain equipment, primarily automobiles, and certain limited supply arrangements.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a ROU asset of $323.6 million and a total lease liability of $322.4 million. The Company’s ROU assets are recorded in other assets. The related lease liability balances are recorded in other current liabilities and other long-term obligations in the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5 Balance Sheet Components for additional information.
ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use an applicable incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. Options to extend or terminate the ROU assets are reviewed at lease inception and these options are accounted for when they are reasonably certain of being exercised.
Other information related to leases was as follows:

 Equity Method InvestmentsThe Company currently has three equity method investments in limited liability companies that own refined coal production plants whose activities qualify for income tax credits under Section 45 of the Code. The Company does not consolidate these entities as we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities and do not have the power to individually direct the activities of these entities. Accordingly, these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For each of the clean energy investments, the Company has entered into notes payable with the respective project sponsor, which in part will be paid to the sponsor as certain production levels are met. The Company’s clean energy investments will wind down upon the expiration of the refined coal tax credit at the end of 2021.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company reduced its long-term obligations for its three investments as a result of lower than anticipated production levels and lower expected future variable debt payments to the respective project sponsor. The Company recognized a net gain of approximately $21.4 million and $7.0 million, respectively, which was recognized as a component of the net loss of the equity method investments in the consolidated statements of operations.
The carrying values and respective balance sheet locations of the Company’s clean energy investments were as follows at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively:

Amortization expense and intangible asset impairment charges, which are included as a component of amortization expense, which is classified primarily within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:

Year ended December 31,
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ------- ----- ------- - -------
(In millions) 2020 2019 2018
Intangible asset amortization expense $ 1,605.8 $ 1,582.7 $ 1,606.4
IPR&D intangible asset impairment charges 37.4 138.3 117.7
Finite-lived intangible asset impairment charges 45.0 42.3 106.3
Total intangible asset amortization expense (including impairment charges) $ 1,688.2 $ 1,763.3 $ 1,830.4

The assessment for impairment of finite-lived intangibles is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets or asset grouping by analyzing the expected future undiscounted pre-tax cash flows specific to the asset or asset grouping. If the carrying amount is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows.
Significant management judgment is involved in estimating the recoverability of these assets and is dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions used in making these estimates, as well as how the estimates compare to the eventual future operating performance of the specific asset or asset grouping. The fair value of finite-lived intangible assets was calculated as the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using a market rate of return. The assumptions inherent in the estimated future cash flows include, among other things, the impact of the current competitive environment and future market expectations. Discount rates ranging between 9.0% and 11.0% were utilized in the valuations performed during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets totaled $29.60 billion and $11.53 billion, respectively. Any future long-lived assets impairment charges could have a material impact in the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s IPR&D assets are tested at least annually for impairment or upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Impairment is determined to exist when the fair value of IPR&D assets, which is based upon updated forecasts and commercial development plans, is less than the carrying value of the assets being tested. The fair value of IPR&D was calculated as the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using a market rate of return. The assumptions inherent in the estimated future cash flows include, among other things, the impact of changes to the development programs, the projected development and regulatory time frames and the current competitive environment. Discount rates ranging between 9.0% and 11.0%, 9.0% and 11.0%, and 9.5% and 13.0% were utilized in the valuations performed during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively.
The fair value of both IPR&D and finite-lived intangible assets was determined based upon detailed valuations employing the income approach which utilized Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 9 Financial Instruments and Risk Management. Changes to any of the Company’s assumptions including changes to or abandonment of development programs,
regulatory timelines, discount rates or the competitive environment related to the assets could lead to future material impairment charges.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on April 1st or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. As a result of the decline in the Mylan share price during the first quarter of 2020, and the general uncertainty and volatility in the economic environments in which the Company operates, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020. The Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2020. There were no significant changes from the interim goodwill test performed at March 31, 2020 and the results were consistent with the interim goodwill impairment test.
Mylan performed both the interim and annual goodwill impairment tests on a quantitative basis for its four reporting units, North America Generics, North America Brands, Europe and Rest of World. In estimating each reporting unit’s fair value, Mylan performed an extensive valuation analysis, utilizing both income and market-based approaches, except for the North America Brands reporting unit where the fair value was estimated utilizing the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting unit’s expected future cash flows. These estimates and assumptions, utilizing Level 3 inputs, primarily include, but are not limited to, market multiples, control premiums, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures forecasts.
As of March 31, 2020 and April 1, 2020, the allocation of the goodwill among the reporting units was as follows: North America Generics $2.60 billion, North America Brands $0.65 billion, Europe $4.43 billion and Rest of World $1.65 billion.
As of March 31, 2020 and April 1, 2020, Mylan determined that the fair value of the North America Generics, North America Brands and Rest of World reporting units was substantially in excess of the respective unit’s carrying value. However, when compared to the April 1, 2019 test, the fair value of the overall business declined because of future forecasts and the decline in share price.
For the Europe reporting unit, the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately $1.2 billion or 11.0% for both the interim and annual goodwill impairment test. As it relates to the income approach for the Europe reporting unit at March 31, 2020 and April 1, 2020, the Company forecasted cash flows for the next 5 years. During the forecast period, the revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately 7.5%. A terminal year value was calculated with a 2.0% revenue growth rate applied. The discount rate utilized was 11.0% and the estimated tax rate was 25.5%. Under the market-based approach, we utilized an estimated range of market multiples of 8.0 to 9.5 times EBITDA plus a control premium of 15.0%. If all other assumptions are held constant, a reduction in the terminal value growth rate by 3.5% or an increase in discount rate by 3.5% would result in an impairment charge for the Europe reporting unit.

Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, changes in underlying assumptions, especially as it relates to the key assumptions detailed, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units.
Intangible asset amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 through 2025 is estimated to be as follows:

 Financial Instruments and Risk Management
The Company is exposed to certain financial risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The primary financial risks that are managed by using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
Foreign Currency Risk Management
In order to manage certain foreign currency risks, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate risk associated with changes in spot exchange rates of mainly non-functional currency denominated assets or liabilities. The foreign exchange forward contracts are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Any gains or losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the period incurred in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company has also entered into forward contracts to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated sales from certain international subsidiaries. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges to manage foreign currency transaction risk and are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Any changes in the fair value of designated cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCE and are reclassified into earnings when the hedged item impacts earnings.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company may hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries by either borrowing directly in foreign currencies and designating all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or entering into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments.
The Company has designated certain Euro borrowings as a hedge of its investment in certain Euro-functional currency subsidiaries in order to manage foreign currency translation risk. Borrowings designated as net investment hedges are marked-to-market using the current spot exchange rate as of the end of the period, with gains and losses included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCE until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investments. In addition, the Company manages the related foreign exchange risk of the Euro borrowings not designated as net investment hedges through certain Euro denominated financial assets and forward currency swaps.
The following table summarizes the principal amounts of the Company’s outstanding Euro borrowings and the notional amounts of the Euro borrowings designated as net investment hedges:

Foreign currency forward contracts 105.6 105.6 —
Total € 6,705.6 € 5,955.6 € 2,354.0

Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company enters into interest rate swaps from time to time in order to manage interest rate risk associated with the Company’s fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. Interest rate swaps that meet specific accounting criteria are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges. All derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk are measured at fair value and reported as current assets or current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the underlying debt obligations are included in interest expense. For cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is deferred through AOCE and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged item impacts earnings.
Cash Flow Hedging Relationships
The Company’s interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges fix the interest rate on a portion of the Company’s variable-rate debt or hedge part of the Company’s interest rate exposure associated with the variability in the future cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates. Any changes in fair value are included in earnings or deferred through AOCE, depending on the nature and effectiveness of the offset. Any ineffectiveness in a cash flow hedging relationship is recognized immediately in earnings in the consolidated statements of operations.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Workfront Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.50 billion in cash consideration. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and issuance of these financial statements. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 79  ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42 million, which represents the difference between the $55 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $126 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $45 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remain...
