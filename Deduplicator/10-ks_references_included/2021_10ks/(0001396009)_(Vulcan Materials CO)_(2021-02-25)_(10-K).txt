ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PENDING ADOPTION
CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity,” which reduces the number of models used to account for convertible instruments and modifies the diluted earnings per share calculations for convertible instruments. This ASU also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity’s own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives The new standard is effective as of January 1, 2022 with early adoption permitted, but no earlier than January 1, 2021. We plan to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2021. We do not currently have any instruments or contracts that will be impacted by the new standard.
INCOME TAXES In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which adds new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes and changes the accounting for certain income tax transactions. The new standard is effective as of January 1, 2021. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

 NATURE OF OPERATIONS
Vulcan Materials Company (the “Company,” “Vulcan,” “we,” “our”), a New Jersey corporation, is the nation's largest supplier of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.
We operate primarily in the United States and our principal product — aggregates — is used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. We serve markets in twenty states, Washington D.C., and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico. Our primary focus is serving metropolitan markets in the United States that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates. While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete in our Alabama, Arizona, California, Maryland, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.C. markets.
While we continue to operate as an essential business, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our industry and the economy, and it may have far-reaching impacts on many aspects of our operations, directly and indirectly, including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors, business and manufacturing operations, our employees, and the market generally.
Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as described below, the results of the Chemicals business are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

 PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vulcan Materials Company and all our majority or
‎wholly-owned subsidiary companies. Partially-owned affiliates are either consolidated or accounted for at cost or as equity investments depending on the level of ownership interest or our ability to exercise control over the affiliates’ operations. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
 USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted (GAAP) in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The most significant estimates included in the preparation of these financial statements are related to goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, business combinations and purchase price allocation, pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental compliance, claims and litigation including self-insurance, and income taxes. Events and changes in circumstances arising after December 31, 2020, including those resulting from the impacts of COVID-19, will be reflected in management’s estimates for future periods.
 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of consideration transferred to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction, and therefore represents an exit price. A fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants.
We may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period after the acquisition date. Any such adjustments are the result of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill, if any, recognized in the transaction. The cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation, amortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined.
 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of our operations. For our non-U.S. subsidiaries, local currency inventories and long-term assets such as property, plant & equipment and intangibles are remeasured into U.S. dollars at approximate rates prevailing when acquired; all other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Inventories charged to cost of sales and depreciation are remeasured at historical rates; all other income and expense items are remeasured at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Gains and losses which result from remeasurement are included in other nonoperating income/expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and are not material for the years presented.
 CASH EQUIVALENTS
We classify as cash equivalents all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.
 RESTRICTED CASH
Restricted cash generally consists of cash proceeds from the sale of property held in escrow for the acquisition of replacement property under like-kind exchange agreements and cash reserved by other contractual agreements (such as asset purchase agreements) for a specified purpose and therefore not available for use for other purposes. The escrow accounts are administered by an intermediary. Cash restricted pursuant to like-kind exchange agreements remains restricted for a maximum of 180 days from the date of the property sale pending the acquisition of replacement property. Restricted cash is included with cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
 ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE
Accounts and notes receivable from customers result from our extending credit to trade customers for the purchase of our products. The terms generally provide for payment within 15 days of the month following invoice. On occasion, when necessary to conform to regional industry practices, we sell product under extended payment terms, which may result in either secured or unsecured short-term notes; or, on occasion, notes with durations of less than one year are taken in settlement of existing accounts receivable. Other accounts and notes receivable result from short-term transactions (less than one year) other than the sale of our products, such as interest receivable, insurance claims, freight claims, bid deposits or rents receivable.
Allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. We regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. Bad debt expense for the years ended December 31 was as follows: 2020 — $1,091,000, 2019 — $1,426,000 and 2018 — $251,000. Write-offs of accounts receivables for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 2020 — $2,046,000, 2019 — $809,000 and 2018 — $1,291,000.

 INVENTORIES
Inventories and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuation for most of our inventories because it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. Such costs include fuel, parts and supplies, raw materials, direct labor and production overhead. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on our estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. Substantially all operating supplies inventory is carried at average cost.
For additional information about inventories see Note 3.
 PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT
Property, plant & equipment (including finance leases) are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization.
Capitalized software costs of $2,110,000 and $2,976,000 are reflected in net property, plant & equipment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We capitalized software costs for the years ended December 31 as follows: 2020 — $1,116,000, 2019 — $1,506,000 and 2018 — $2,213,000.
For assets sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed, and any related gain or loss is reflected in income.For additional information about our property, plant & equipment see Note 4.

 REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE
Repair and maintenance costs generally are charged to operating expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments that add materially to the utility or useful lives of property, plant & equipment are capitalized and subsequently depreciated. Actual costs for planned major maintenance activities, related primarily to periodic overhauls on our oceangoing vessels, are capitalized and amortized to the next overhaul.
 LEASES
Our nonmineral leases with initial terms in excess of one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities. Mineral leases are exempt from balance sheet recognition.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease term only includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets are adjusted for any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. Except for equipment with monthly monitoring service where the service component accounts for a majority of the lease cost, the non-lease components of our lease agreements are not separated from the lease components.

For additional information about leases see Note 7.
 DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION, ACCRETION AND AMORTIZATION
Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated service lives of the various classes of assets, which include machinery and equipment (3 to 35 years), buildings (7 to 20 years) and land improvements (3 to 20 years). Finance leases are amortized over varying periods not in excess of applicable lease terms or estimated useful lives. Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis beginning when the software project is substantially complete.
Cost depletion on depletable land is computed by the unit-of-sales method based on estimated recoverable units.
Accretion reflects the period-to-period increase in the carrying amount of the liability for asset retirement obligations. It is computed using the same credit-adjusted, risk-free rate used to initially measure the liability at fair value.
Leaseholds are amortized over varying periods not in excess of applicable lease terms or estimated useful lives.
Amortization of intangible assets subject to amortization is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets.
‎A significant portion of our intangible assets is contractual rights in place associated with zoning, permitting and other rights to access and extract aggregates reserves. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-sales method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method.

 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. From time to time, and consistent with our risk management policies, we use derivative instruments to balance the cost and risk of such expenses. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationship. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. We may also enter into contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales (NPNS) exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, we apply such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract’s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.
For additional information about derivative instruments see Note 5.
 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
‎Level 2: Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data
‎Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement
Our assets at December 31 subject to fair value measurement on a recurring basis are summarized below:

We have two Rabbi Trusts for the purpose of providing a level of security for the employee nonqualified retirement and deferred compensation plans and for the directors' nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The fair values of these investments are estimated using a market approach. The Level 1 investments include mutual funds for which quoted prices in active markets are available. Level 2 investments are stated at estimated fair value based on the underlying investments in the fund (short-term, highly liquid assets in commercial paper, short-term bonds and certificates of deposit).
Net gains (losses) of the Rabbi Trusts’ investments were $4,469,000, $3,993,000 and $(2,741,000) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The portions of the net gains (losses) related to investments still held by the Rabbi Trusts at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $4,140,000, $3,729,000 and $(4,386,000), respectively.
The carrying values of our cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, short-term debt, trade payables and accruals, and all other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for derivative instruments and interest-bearing debt are presented in Notes 5 and 6, respectively.

 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill totaled $3,172,112,000 as compared to $3,167,061,000 at December 31, 2019. Goodwill represents 27% of total assets at December 31, 2020 compared to 30% at December 31, 2019.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, one level below our operating segments. We have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium. Within these four operating segments, we have identified 17 reporting units (of which 9 carry goodwill) based primarily on geographic location. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a quantitative test. We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.
The quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess.
The results of the annual impairment tests performed as of November 1, 2020, 2019 and 2018 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values. Accordingly, there were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.
We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach (which involves discounting estimated future cash flows) and a market approach (which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies). Determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.

 IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Fair value is determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.
We test long-lived assets for impairment at the a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g., asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) determines the profitability of the downstream business.
As of December 31, 2020, net property, plant & equipment represents 38% of total assets, while net other intangible assets represents 10% of total assets. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded no material losses on impairment of long-lived assets.
For additional information about long-lived assets and intangible assets see Notes 4 and 18, respectively.

 REVENUES AND REVENUE RECOGNITION
Total revenues include sales of product and services to customers, net of any discounts and taxes, and freight and delivery revenues billed to customers. Freight and delivery generally represent pass-through transportation we incur (including our administrative costs) and pay to third-party carriers to deliver our products to customers. The cost related to freight and delivery is included in cost of revenues.
Revenues for product sales are recognized when control passes to the customer (typically occurs when finished products are shipped/delivered). Construction paving revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.
For additional information regarding revenues and revenue recognition see Note 2.
 STRIPPING COSTS
In the mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral deposits are referred to as stripping costs.
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are considered costs of extracted minerals under our inventory costing system, inventoried, and recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory. The production stage is deemed to begin when the activities, including removal of overburden and waste material that may contain incidental saleable material, required to access the saleable product are complete. Stripping costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced were $90,432,000 in 2020, $86,090,000 in 2019 and $78,911,000 in 2018.
Conversely, stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are excluded from our inventory cost. Pre-production stripping costs are capitalized and reported within other noncurrent assets in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are expensed over the productive life of the mine using the unit-of-sales method. Pre-production stripping costs included in other noncurrent assets were $92,880,000 as of December 31, 2020 and $92,759,000 as of December 31, 2019.

 RECLAMATION COSTS
Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.
To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost (including a reasonable profit margin) for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.
In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.
We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.
The carrying value of these obligations was $283,163,000 as of December 31, 2020 and $210,323,000 as of December 31, 2019. For additional information about reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations) see Note 17.

 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
Our environmental compliance costs are undiscounted and include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. We accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost. At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than the completion of the remedial feasibility study.
When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. If no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 2020, the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $5,905,000 — this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. However, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.
For additional information about environmental compliance costs see Note 8.

 CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE
We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to $2,000,000 per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $10,000,000 per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels.
Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred. The following table outlines our self-insurance program at December 31:

 SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
All of our share-based compensation awards are classified as equity awards. We measure share-based compensation awards using fair-value-based measurement methods. This results in the recognition of compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards based on their fair value as of the grant date. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.
A summary of the estimated future compensation cost (unrecognized compensation expense) as of December 31, 2020 related to share-based awards granted to employees under our long-term incentive plans is presented below:

We receive an income tax deduction for share-based compensation equal to the excess of the market value of our common stock on the date of exercise or issuance over the exercise price. Tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized (excess tax benefits) are reflected as discrete income tax benefits in the period of exercise or issuance. Net excess tax benefits were recorded as reductions to our income tax expense and reflected as operating cash flows, as follows (combined federal and state): 2020 — $8,368,000; 2019 — $21,020,000 and 2018 — $20,137,000.

 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits requires that we use assumptions for the valuation of projected benefit obligations (PBO) and the performance of plan assets. Each year, we review our assumptions for discount rates (used for PBO, service cost, and interest cost calculations) and the expected return on plan assets. Due to plan changes made in 2012 and 2013, annual pay increases and the per capita cost of healthcare benefits do not materially impact plan obligations.
DISCOUNT RATES — We use a high-quality bond full yield curve approach (specific spot rates for each annual expected cash flow) to establish the discount rates at each measurement date. See Note 10 for the discount rates used for PBO, service cost, and interest cost calculations.
EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS — Our expected return on plan assets is: (1) a long-term view based on our current asset allocation, and (2) a judgment informed by consultation with our retirement plans’ consultant and our pension plans’ actuary. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the expected return on plan assets was 5.75% for the period January 1, 2020 – November 30, 2020 and 5.25% for the period December 1, 2020 – December 31, 2020 (5.75% for 2019). The plans were remeasured at November 30, 2020 to reflect settlement accounting (due to a voluntary lump-sum settlement offer to certain fully vested plan participants) for the CMG Hourly Pension Plan and the Vulcan Materials Company (VMC) Pension Plan (the Chemicals and Salaried Pension Plans were merged to form the VMC Pension Plan effective November 30, 2020).
Accounting standards provide for the delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results. This delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition in earnings of changes in benefit obligations and asset performance. The differences between actual results and expected or estimated results are recognized in full in other comprehensive income. Amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in a systematic manner over the average remaining service period of participants for our active plans or the average remaining lifetime of participants for our inactive plans.
We present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in cost of revenues and selling, administrative and general expense consistent with employee compensation costs. The other components of net periodic benefit cost are reported within other nonoperating income in our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
For additional information about pension and other postretirement benefits see Note 10.

 INCOME TAXES
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law in March 2020. The CARES Act provides numerous tax relief provisions and stimulus measures. A temporary favorable change to the prior year and current year limitations on interest deductions and a temporary suspension of certain payment requirements for the employer portion of Social Security taxes are the relief provisions that are expected to provide us the greatest benefit. In the first quarter of 2020, an expected cash tax benefit of $13,301,000 was recorded to account for the favorable change to the prior year limitation on interest deductions.
We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns and account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities (which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will pay) based on the differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns.
Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items. We are required to account for the effects of changes in income tax rates on deferred tax balances in the period in which the legislation is enacted.
Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note 9.

We recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position. For a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation.
Generally, we are not subject to significant changes in income taxes by any taxing jurisdiction for the years before 2017. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate.
We consider a tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being “effectively settled,” settlement of an examination, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Upon resolution of a tax position, any liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be released.
Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.
Our largest permanent item in computing both our taxable income and effective tax rate is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in Note 9. The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings.

 COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
We report comprehensive income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Consolidated Statements of Equity. Comprehensive income comprises two subsets: net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI). OCI includes adjustments to cash flow hedges, as well as actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs related to pension and postretirement benefit plans.
For additional information about comprehensive income see Note 14.
 EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)
Earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average common shares outstanding (basic EPS) or weighted-average common shares outstanding assuming dilution (diluted EPS), as set forth below:

------------------------------------------- ------- ------- -------

All dilutive common stock equivalents are reflected in our earnings per share calculations. In periods of loss, shares that otherwise would have been included in our diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding computation would be excluded.
Antidilutive common stock equivalents are not included in our earnings per share calculations. The number of antidilutive common stock equivalents for which the exercise price exceeds the weighted-average market price for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the 2020 presentation.
 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RECENTLY ADOPTED
DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS During the fourth quarter of 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-14, “Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.” This ASU added, removed and clarified the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As a result of this update, we modified our annual disclosure regarding our benefit plans as reflected in Note 10.
CREDIT LOSSES During the first quarter of 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” on a retrospective basis. This ASU amended prior guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The new guidance estimates credit losses based on expected losses, modifies the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provides for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The adoption of this standard did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
LIBOR TRANSITION In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting," which provided optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The ASU was effective immediately for all entities and applies through December 31, 2022. For additional information, see our LIBOR transition disclosure in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under "Liquidity and Financial Resources - Debt." We continue to evaluate the effect that discontinuance of LIBOR will have on our contracts.
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS PENDING ADOPTION
CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity,” which reduces the number of models used to account for convertible instruments and modifies the diluted earnings per share calculations for convertible instruments. This ASU also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entity’s own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives The new standard is effective as of January 1, 2022 with early adoption permitted, but no earlier than January 1, 2021. We plan to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2021. We do not currently have any instruments or contracts that will be impacted by the new standard.
INCOME TAXES In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which adds new guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes and changes the accounting for certain income tax transactions. The new standard is effective as of January 1, 2021. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
 NOTE 2: REVENUES
Revenues are measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Sales and other taxes we collect are excluded from revenues. Costs to obtain and fulfill contracts (primarily asphalt construction paving contracts) are immaterial and are expensed as incurred when the expected amortization period is one year or less.
Total revenues are primarily derived from our product sales of aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel, sand and other aggregates), asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete, and include freight & delivery costs that we pass along to our customers to deliver these products. We also generate service revenues from our asphalt construction paving business and service revenues related to our aggregates business, such as landfill tipping fees. Our total service revenues were as follows: 2020 — $214,343,000, 2019 — $234,099,000 and 2018 — $198,897,000.

Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately 45% to 55% of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly-funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly-funded construction, the vast majority of our aggregates business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.
Our segment total revenues by geographic market for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are disaggregated as follows:

PRODUCT REVENUES
Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied; generally this occurs at a point in time when our aggregates, asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete are shipped/delivered and control passes to the customer. Revenue for our products is recorded at the fixed invoice amount and payment is due by the 15th day of the following month — we do not offer discounts for early payment.
Freight & delivery generally represents pass-through transportation we incur (including our administrative costs) and pay to third-party carriers to deliver our products to customers and are accounted for as a fulfillment activity. Likewise, the cost related to freight & delivery are included in cost of revenues.

CONSTRUCTION PAVING SERVICE REVENUES
Revenue from our asphalt construction paving business is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion method under the cost approach. The percentage of completion is determined by costs incurred to date as a percentage of total costs estimated for the project. Under this approach, recognized contract revenue equals the total estimated contract revenue multiplied by the percentage of completion. Our construction contracts are unit priced, and an account receivable is recorded for amounts invoiced based on actual units produced. Contract assets for estimated earnings in excess of billings, contract assets related to retainage provisions and contract liabilities for billings in excess of costs are immaterial. Variable consideration in our construction paving contracts is immaterial and consists of incentives and penalties based on the quality of work performed. Our construction paving contracts may contain warranty provisions covering defects in equipment, materials, design or workmanship that generally run from nine months to one year after project completion. Due to the nature of our construction paving projects, including contract owner inspections of the work during construction and prior to acceptance, we have not experienced material warranty costs for these short-term warranties.
VOLUMETRIC PRODUCTION PAYMENT DEFERRED REVENUES
In 2013 and 2012, we sold a percentage interest in certain future aggregates production for net cash proceeds of $226,926,000. These transactions, structured as volumetric production payments (VPPs):
relate to eight quarries in Georgia and South Carolina
provide the purchaser solely with a nonoperating percentage interest in the subject quarries’ future aggregates production
contain no minimum annual or cumulative guarantees by us for production or sales volume, nor minimum sales price
are both volume and time limited (we expect the transactions will last approximately 25 years, limited by volume rather than time)
We are the exclusive sales agent for, and transmit quarterly to the purchaser the proceeds from the sale of, the purchaser’s share of aggregates production. Our consolidated total revenues exclude the revenue from the sale of the purchaser’s share of aggregates.
The proceeds we received from the sale of the percentage interest were recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. We recognize revenue on a unit-of-sales basis (as we sell the purchaser’s share of production) relative to the volume limitations of the transactions. Given the nature of the risks and potential rewards assumed by the buyer, the transactions do not reflect financing activities.

Reconciliation of the VPP deferred revenue balances (current and noncurrent) is as follows:

---------------------------------------- --------- --------- ---------

in thousands 2020 2019 2018

Balance at beginning of year $ 185,339 $ 192,783 $ 199,556

Balance at end of year $ 177,962 $ 185,339 $ 192,783

Based on expected sales from the specified quarries, we expect to recognize $7,500,000 of VPP deferred revenue as income in 2021 (reflected in other current liabilities in our December 31, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet).

Raw materials 33,780 31,318

Total $ 448,585 $ 458,308

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 Includes inventories encumbered by volumetric production payments (see Note 2), as follows: December 31, 2020 — $2,416 thousand and December 31, 2019 — $2,861 thousand.

In addition to the inventory balances presented above, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we have $10,978,000 and $7,557,000, respectively, of inventory classified as long-term assets (other noncurrent assets) as we do not expect to sell the inventory within one year of their respective balance sheet dates.
We use the LIFO method of valuation for most of our inventories as it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. Inventories valued under the LIFO method total $307,656,000 at December 31, 2020 and $309,429,000 at December 31, 2019. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, inventory reductions resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory layers carried at costs prevailing in prior years as compared to current-year costs. The effect of the LIFO liquidation on 2020 results was to decrease cost of revenues by $867,000 and increase net earnings by $646,000. The effect of the LIFO liquidation on 2019 results was to decrease cost of revenues by $1,147,000 and increase net earnings by $854,000. The effect of the LIFO liquidation on 2018 results was to increase cost of revenues by $132,000 and decrease net earnings by $99,000.
Estimated current cost exceeded LIFO cost at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by $192,974,000 and $183,181,000, respectively. In periods of increasing costs, LIFO generally results in higher cost of revenues than under FIFO. In periods of decreasing costs, the results are generally the opposite. We provide supplemental income disclosures to facilitate comparisons with companies not on LIFO. The supplemental income calculation is derived by tax-affecting the change in the LIFO reserve for the periods presented. If all inventories valued at LIFO cost had been valued under first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, the approximate effect on net earnings would have been an increase of $7,292,000 in 2020, an increase of $5,462,000 in 2019 and an increase of $5,223,000 in 2018.

 NOTE 5: DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. From time to time, and consistent with our risk management policies, we use derivative instruments to balance the cost and risk of such expenses. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
In February 2020, we entered into interest rate locks of a future debt issuance to hedge the risk of higher interest rates. These interest rate locks were designated as cash flow hedges. Consistent with their terms, we settled the interest rate locks in March 2020 for a cash payment of $19,863,000. Given that the related debt issuance at the end of the first quarter: a) was not executed, b) remained probable in the near term and c) had uncertain timing, 1/20th of the hedge was deemed ineffective and $993,000 of the settlement was recorded to interest expense in the first quarter. The remainder of the settlement was deferred and recorded in AOCI. In May 2020, we issued the related debt in the form of $750,000,000 of 3.50% 10-year notes. The deferred hedge settlement amount in AOCI is amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt.
In 2007 and 2018, we entered into interest rate locks of future debt issuances to hedge the risk of higher interest rates. These interest rate locks were designated as cash flow hedges. The gain/loss upon settlement of these interest rate hedges is deferred (recorded in AOCI) and amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt.

This amortization was reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31 as follows:

1 Borrowings on the bank line of credit are classified as short-term if we intend to repay within twelve months and as long-term if we have the intent and ability to extend payment beyond twelve months.

Discounts and debt issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest method over the terms of the respective notes resulting in $7,203,000 and $4,983,000, respectively, of net interest expense for these items for 2020 and 2019.

LINE OF CREDIT
In September 2020, we executed a new five-year unsecured line of credit of $1,000,000,000, incurring $4,632,000 of transaction costs. The line of credit contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for an unsecured investment-grade facility. There are two primary negative covenants: 1) a limit on our ability to incur secured debt, and 2) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA of 3.50:1 (upon certain acquisitions, the maximum ratio can be 3.75:1 for four quarters). As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the line of credit covenants.
Borrowings on our line of credit are classified as short-term if we intend to repay within twelve months and as long-term if we have the intent and ability to extend repayment beyond twelve months. Borrowings bear interest, at our option, at either LIBOR plus a credit margin ranging from 1.125% to 1.875%, or Truist Bank’s base rate (generally, its prime rate) plus a credit margin ranging from 0.125% to 0.875%. The credit margin for both LIBOR and base rate borrowings is determined by our credit ratings. Standby letters of credit, which are issued under the line of credit and reduce availability, are charged a fee equal to the credit margin for LIBOR borrowings plus 0.175%. We also pay a commitment fee on the daily average unused amount of the line of credit that ranges from 0.125% to 0.275% determined by our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2020, the credit margin for LIBOR borrowings was 1.250%, the credit margin for base rate borrowings was 0.250%, and the commitment fee for the unused amount was 0.150%.
In September 2020, we terminated our $750,000,000 364-day delayed draw term loan executed in April 2020. During the second quarter, we had borrowed and repaid $250,000,000 on this delayed draw term loan leaving $500,000,000 available for future borrowings prior to its termination.
As of December 31, 2020, our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was $943,920,000. Utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows:
none was borrowed
$56,080,000 was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit
TERM DEBT
All of our $3,357,899,000 (face value) of term debt is unsecured. $3,346,188,000 of such debt is governed by three essentially identical indentures that contain customary investment-grade type covenants. The primary covenant in all three indentures limits the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing such debt. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all term debt covenants.
In May 2020, we issued $750,000,000 of 3.50% senior notes due 2030. Total proceeds were $741,417,000 (net of discounts and transaction costs). $250,000,000 of the proceeds were used to retire the $250,000,000 floating rate notes due June 2020, and the remainder of the proceeds, together with cash on hand, will be used to retire the $500,000,000 floating rate notes due March 2021.
In 2018, we completed a number of financing activities resulting in gross proceeds of $850,000,000 and payments of $892,055,000. As a result of these activities, we recognized premiums of $5,608,000, transaction costs of $1,314,000 and noncash expense (acceleration of unamortized deferred transaction costs) of $466,000. The combined charge of $7,388,000 was a component of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The total scheduled (principal and interest) debt payments, excluding the line of credit, for the five years subsequent to December 31, 2020 are as follows:

STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT
We provide, in the normal course of business, certain third-party beneficiaries with standby letters of credit to support our obligations to pay or perform according to the requirements of an underlying agreement. Such letters of credit typically have an initial term of one year, typically renew automatically, and can only be modified or canceled with the approval of the beneficiary. All of our standby letters of credit are issued by banks that participate in our $1,000,000,000 line of credit and reduce the borrowing capacity thereunder. Our standby letters of credit as of December 31, 2020 are summarized by purpose in the table below:

 NOTE 7: LEASES
Our portfolio of nonmineral leases is composed of leases for real estate (including office buildings, aggregates sales yards, and concrete and asphalt sites) and equipment (including railcars and rail track, barges, office equipment and plant equipment).
Lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities reflected on our December 31 balance sheets and the weighted-average lease term and discount rate are as follows:

Our building leases have remaining noncancelable periods of 0 - 7 years and lease terms (including options to extend) of 0 - 26 years. Key factors in determining the certainty of lease renewals include the location of the building, the value of leasehold improvements and the cost to relocate. Rental payments for certain of our building leases are periodically adjusted for inflation, and this variable component is recognized as expense when incurred. Many of our building leases contain common area maintenance charges which we include in the calculation of our lease liability (the lease consideration is not allocated between the lease and non-lease components).
Our aggregates sales yard leases have remaining noncancelable periods of 0 - 28 years and lease terms of 0 - 78 years. The key factor in determining the certainty of lease renewals is the financial impact of extending the lease, including the reserve life of the sourcing aggregates quarry. Certain aggregates sales yard lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of sales over contractual levels or the number of shipments received into the sales yard. Variable payments for these sales yards comprise a majority of the overall variable lease cost presented in the table below.
Our concrete and asphalt site leases have remaining noncancelable periods of 0 - 19 years and lease terms of 1 - 78 years. The key factor in determining the certainty of lease renewals is the financial impact of extending the lease, including the reserve life of the sourcing aggregates quarry. Rental payments are generally fixed for our concrete and asphalt sites.
Our rail (car and track) leases have remaining noncancelable periods of 0 - 4 years and lease terms of 2 - 64 years. Key factors in determining the certainty of lease renewals include the market rental rate for comparable assets and, in some cases, the cost incurred to restore the asset. Rental payments are fixed for our rail leases. The majority of our rail leases contain substitution rights that allow the supplier to replace damaged equipment. Because these rights are generally limited to either replacing railcars or moving our placement on rail track for purposes of repair or maintenance, we do not consider these substitution rights to be substantive and have recorded a lease liability and ROU asset for all leased rail.

Our barge leases have remaining noncancelable periods of 0 - 1 years and lease terms of 0 - 14 years. Key factors in determining the certainty of lease renewals include the market rental rate for comparable assets and, in some cases, the cost incurred to restore the asset. Rental payments are fixed. Like our rail leases, our barge leases contain non-substantive substitution rights that are limited to replacing barges in need of repair or maintenance.
Office and plant equipment leases have remaining noncancelable periods of 0 - 5 years and lease terms of 0 - 5 years. The key factor in determining the certainty of lease renewals is the market rental rate for comparable assets. Rental payments are generally fixed for our equipment leases with terms greater than 1 year. The significant majority of our short-term lease cost presented in the table below is derived from office and plant equipment leases with terms of 1 year or less.
Our lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants or early termination options that we deem material. We have not sought or been granted any material lease concessions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Accrued Environmental Remediation Costs
Continuing operations $ 25,544 $ 30,429
Retained from former Chemicals business 10,971 10,972
Total $ 36,515 $ 41,401

The long-term portion of the accruals noted above is included in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and amounted to $12,943,000 at December 31, 2020 and $13,567,000 at December 31, 2019. The short-term portion of these accruals is included in other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The accrued environmental remediation costs in continuing operations relate primarily to the former Florida Rock, Tarmac, and CalMat facilities acquired in 2007, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The balances noted above for the former Chemicals business relate to retained environmental remediation costs from the 2003 sale of the Performance Chemicals business and the 2005 sale of the Chloralkali business. Refer to Note 12 for additional discussion of contingent environmental matters.

Deferred taxes on the balance sheet result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes. The components of the net deferred income tax liability at December 31 are as follows:

Total deferred tax liabilities $ 905,051 $ 866,429
Net deferred tax liability $ 706,050 $ 633,039

Each quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2020, we have Alabama state net operating loss (NOL) carryforward deferred tax assets of $64,307,000, against which we have a valuation allowance of $29,236,000. Almost all of the Alabama NOL carryforward would expire between 2023 and 2029 if not utilized.
In February 2021, the Alabama Business Competitiveness Act (the Act) was signed into law. This Act contained a provision that requires most taxpayers to change from a three-factor, double-weighted sales method to a single-sales factor method to apportion income to Alabama. This provision was effective as of January 1, 2021 and likely will result in a substantial reduction in our apportionment of income to Alabama; thereby, further inhibiting our ability to utilize our Alabama NOL carryforward. In the first quarter of 2021, we will assess the impact of the Act to our Alabama NOL carryforward and adjust our valuation allowance accordingly.

Changes in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

----------------------------------------------- ------- ------- --------

in thousands 2020 2019 2018
Unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1 $ 5,442 $ 3,661 $ 11,643
Increases for tax positions related to

Current year 1,884 3,224 698
Decreases for tax positions related to

Expiration of applicable statute of limitations (862) (1,716) (8,025)
Unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 $ 6,817 $ 5,442 $ 3,661

We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Interest and penalties recognized as income tax expense (benefit) were $36,000 in 2020, $(11,000) in 2019 and $(1,477,000) in 2018. The balance of accrued interest and penalties included in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 was $336,000 in 2020, $301,000 in 2019 and $312,000 in 2018. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits at December 31 in the table above includes $6,641,000 in 2020, $5,292,000 in 2019 and $3,481,000 in 2018 that would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. We anticipate no single tax position generating a significant increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of this reporting date.
As of December 31, 2020, income tax receivables of $5,314,000 and $938,000 are included in other accounts and notes receivable and other current assets, respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. There were similar receivables of $299,000 recorded in other current assets as of December 31, 2019.

 NOTE 10: BENEFIT PLANS
PENSION PLANS
We sponsor two qualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans, the Vulcan Materials Company Pension Plan (VMC Pension Plan) and the CMG Hourly Pension Plan (CMG Pension Plan). The VMC Pension Plan has been closed to new entrants since 2007 and benefit accruals, based on salaries or wages and years of service, ceased in 2005 for hourly participants and 2013 for salaried participants. The CMG Pension Plan is closed to new entrants other than through one small union and benefits continue to accrue equal to a flat dollar amount for each year of service.
In addition to these qualified plans, we sponsor three unfunded, nonqualified pension plans. The projected benefit obligation presented in the table below includes $67,241,000 and $70,298,000 related to these unfunded, nonqualified pension plans for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
At November 30, 2020, the plans were remeasured to reflect settlement accounting for the CMG Pension Plan and the VMC Pension Plan as a result of voluntary lump sum distributions to certain fully vested plan participants.
The following table sets forth the combined funded status of the plans and their reconciliation with the related amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements at December 31:

Plan assets are invested according to an investment policy that allocates investments to return seeking assets and liability hedging assets based on the plans’ funded ratio (fair value of assets/PBO). At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total pension asset allocation was approximately 50% return seeking and 50% liability hedging. Return seeking assets include index and actively managed mutual funds and collective investment trusts that hold public equity securities (less than 1% of the plans’ assets are in private equity and debt securities via private partnerships). Liability hedging assets include money market securities, inflation linked debt securities, public corporate debt securities, and government debt securities that are actively managed to match the duration of the plans’ liabilities.
At each measurement date, we estimate the net asset values and fair values of our pension assets using various valuation techniques. For certain investments, we use the net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient to estimating fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
‎Level 2: Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data
‎Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement
The fair values and net asset values of our pension plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are in the tables below. The assets in the common/collective trusts and in the private partnerships consist of both return seeking and liability hedging investments.

The following describes the types of investments included in each asset category listed in the tables above and the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair values or net asset values as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The debt funds category consists of U.S. federal, state and local government debt securities, corporate debt securities, foreign government debt securities, and asset-backed securities. The fair values of U.S. government and corporate debt securities are based on current market rates and credit spreads for debt securities with similar maturities. The fair values of debt securities issued by foreign governments are based on prices obtained from broker/dealers and international indices. The fair values of asset-backed securities are priced using prepayment speed and spread inputs that are sourced from the new issue market.
The equity funds category consists of a mutual fund investing in domestic equities. For investment funds publicly traded on a national securities exchange, the fair value is based on quoted market prices. For investment funds not traded on an exchange, the total fair value of the underlying securities is used to determine the net asset value for each unit of the fund held by the pension fund. The estimated fair values of the underlying securities are generally valued based on quoted market prices. For securities without quoted market prices, other observable market inputs are used to determine the fair value.
Common/collective trust fund investments consist of index funds for domestic equities, an actively managed fund for international equities, and a short-term investment fund for highly liquid, short-term debt securities. Investments are valued at the net asset value (NAV) of units of a bank collective trust. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund less its liabilities. This practical expedient is not used when it is determined to be probable that the fund will sell the investment for an amount different than the reported NAV.
The private partnerships category consists of various venture capital funds, mezzanine debt funds and leveraged buyout funds. The NAV of these investments has been estimated based on methods employed by the general partners, including reference to third-party transactions and valuations of comparable companies.
Total employer contributions to the pension plans are presented below:

Employer Contributions
 2018 $ 109,631

For our qualified pension plans, we made discretionary contributions of $100,000,000 during 2018, and made no contributions during 2020 and 2019. We do not anticipate making contributions to our qualified pension plans in 2021. For our nonqualified pension plans, we contributed $8,819,000, $8,882,000 and $9,631,000 during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and expect to contribute $8,060,000 during 2021.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

 2026-2030 279,537

We contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements for union-represented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans differ from single employer plans as follows:
assets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers
if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers
if we cease to have an obligation to contribute to one or more of the multiemployer plans to which we contribute, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability
None of the multiemployer pension plans that we participate in are individually significant. Our contributions to individual multiemployer pension plans did not exceed 5% of the plans’ total contributions in the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Total contributions to multiemployer pension plans were $10,277,000 in 2020, $10,385,000 in 2019 and $10,081,000 in 2018.
As of December 31, 2020, a total of 8.2% of our domestic hourly labor force was covered by collective-bargaining agreements. Of such employees covered by collective-bargaining agreements, 14.0% were covered by agreements that expire in 2021. We also employed 339 union employees in Mexico who are covered by a collective-bargaining agreement that will expire in 2021. None of our union employees in Mexico participate in multiemployer pension plans.
In addition to the pension plans noted above, we had one unfunded supplemental retirement plan as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The accrued costs for the supplemental retirement plan were $2,525,000 at December 31, 2020 and $1,069,000 at December 31, 2019.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS
In addition to pension benefits, we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. In 2012, we amended our postretirement healthcare plan to cap our portion of the medical coverage cost at the 2015 level (as a result, the accumulated benefit obligation equals the projected benefit obligation). Substantially all our salaried employees and, where applicable, certain of our hourly employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach a qualifying age and meet certain service requirements. Generally, Company-provided healthcare benefits end when covered individuals become eligible for Medicare benefits, become eligible for other group insurance coverage or reach age 65, whichever occurs first.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ASSUMPTIONS
Each year, we review our assumptions for discount rates (used for PBO, service cost, and interest cost calculations) and the expected return on plan assets. Due to plan changes made in 2012 and 2013, annual pay increases and the per capita cost of healthcare benefits do not materially impact plan obligations.
We use a high-quality bond full yield curve approach (specific spot rates for each annual expected cash flow) to establish the discount rates at each measurement date. At December 31, 2020, the discount rates used were as follows:
PBO for various plans – ranged from 1.55% to 2.72% (December 31, 2019 ranged from 2.67% to 3.37%)
Service cost – weighted average of 2.92% and 3.09%, respectively, for our pension plans and our other postretirement plans (2019 figures were 4.59% and 4.23%, respectively)
Interest cost – weighted average of 2.78% and 2.42%, respectively, for our pension plans and our other postretirement plans (2019 figures were 4.02% and 3.63%, respectively)
Our expected return on plan assets is: (1) a long-term view based on our current asset allocation, and (2) a judgment informed by consultation with our retirement plans’ consultant and our pension plans’ actuary. The expected return on plan assets used to measure plan benefit costs was 5.75% for the period January 1, 2020 – November 30, 2020 and 5.25% for the period December 1, 2020 – December 31, 2020 (5.75% in 2019). For 2021, we set the expected return on plan assets to 5.25%.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
In addition to our pension and postretirement plans, we sponsor two defined contribution plans. Substantially all salaried and nonunion hourly employees are eligible to be covered by one of these plans. Under these plans, we match employees’ eligible contributions at established rates. Expense recognized in connection with these matching obligations totaled $50,772,000 in 2020, $53,853,000 in 2019 and $40,718,000 in 2018.

 NOTE 11: INCENTIVE PLANS
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
Our 2016 Omnibus Long-term Incentive Plan (Plan) authorizes the granting of performance shares, restricted shares, Stock-Only Stock Appreciation Rights (SOSARs) and other types of share-based awards to key salaried employees and nonemployee directors. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan is 8,000,000, of which 6,331,687 shares remain under this authorization.
PERFORMANCE SHARES — Each performance share unit is equal to and paid in one share of our common stock, but carries no voting or dividend rights. The number of units ultimately paid for performance share awards may range from 0% to 200% of the number of units awarded on the date of grant. Payment is based upon the outcome of performance and/or market conditions. Awards vest on December 31 of the third year after date of grant. Vesting is accelerated upon death, disability, or change of control and the awards become non-forfeitable upon reaching retirement age — all as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested units are forfeited upon termination for any other reason. Expense provisions referable to performance share awards amounted to $17,798,000 in 2020, $18,236,000 in 2019 and $13,656,000 in 2018.
The fair value of performance shares is estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The following table summarizes the activity for nonvested performance share units during the year ended December 31, 2020:

------------------------------ --------- --------- -------- ----------------

 Target Weighted-average
 Number Grant Date

Granted 117,740 133.95
Vested (112,302) 117.19
Canceled/forfeited (6,483) 120.66
Nonvested at December 31, 2020 243,859 $ 121.53

During 2019 and 2018, the weighted-average grant date fair value of performance shares granted was $110.39 and $117.20, respectively.
The aggregate values for distributed performance share awards are based on the closing price of our common stock as of the distribution date. The aggregate values of distributed performance shares for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

------------------------------ -------- -------- --------

in thousands 2020 2019 2018
Aggregate value of distributed
performance shares $ 38,841 $ 33,169 $ 53,721

‎

RESTRICTED SHARES — Each restricted share unit is equal to and paid in one share of our common stock, but carries no voting or dividend rights. Awards vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is accelerated upon reaching retirement age, death, disability, or change of control, all as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested units are forfeited upon termination for any other reason. Expense provisions referable to restricted share awards amounted to $9,766,000 in 2020, $7,789,000 in 2019 and $4,831,000 in 2018.
The fair value of restricted shares is estimated as of the date of grant based on the stock price adjusted for dividends foregone. The following table summarizes the activity for nonvested restricted share units during the year ended December 31, 2020:

------------------------------ -------- --------- -------- ----------------

 Weighted-average
 Number Grant Date

Canceled/forfeited (7,746) 119.63
Nonvested at December 31, 2020 200,153 $ 121.11

During 2019 and 2018, the weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted shares granted was $110.39 and $117.20, respectively.
The aggregate values for distributed restricted share awards are based on the closing price of our common stock as of the distribution date. The aggregate values of distributed restricted shares for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

Aggregate value of distributed
restricted shares $ 12,210 $ 2,417 $ 1,345

STOCK-ONLY STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SOSARs) — SOSARs granted have an exercise price equal to the market value of our underlying common stock on the date of grant. The SOSARs vest ratably over 3 years and expire 10 years subsequent to the date of grant. Vesting is accelerated upon reaching retirement age, death, disability, or change of control, all as defined in the award agreement. Nonvested awards are forfeited upon termination for any other reason.
The fair value of SOSARs is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation cost for SOSARs is based on this grant date fair value and is recognized for awards that ultimately vest. The following table presents the weighted-average fair value and the weighted-average assumptions used in estimating the fair value of grants during the years ended December 31:

----------------------- ------- ---- ------- ---- ------- ----

 2020 2019 2018
SOSARs
Fair value $ 40.91 $ 38.90 $ 43.72
Risk-free interest rate 1.50% 2.62% 2.90%
Dividend yield 0.71% 0.87% 1.39%
Volatility 25.74% 27.23% 31.49%
Expected term (years) 9.00 9.00 9.00

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield at the date of grant of a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity period approximating the SOSARs expected term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our historical dividend payouts adjusted for current expectations of future payouts. The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility and expectations about future volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the SOSARs expected term. The expected term is based on historical experience and expectations about future exercises and represents the period of time that SOSARs granted are expected to be outstanding.

‎

A summary of our SOSAR activity as of December 31, 2020 and changes during the year are presented below:

-------------------------------- --------- --------- ------- ---------------- ---- ---------------- -------- ---------------

 Weighted-average
 Remaining Aggregate
 Number Weighted-average Contractual Intrinsic Value
 of Shares Exercise Price Life (Years) (in thousands)
SOSARs
Outstanding at January 1, 2020 944,599 $ 76.84
Granted 75,300 133.95
Exercised (229,993) 48.16
Forfeited or expired (1,470) 43.05

Exercisable at December 31, 2020 641,613 $ 82.84 4.23 $ 40,949

The aggregate intrinsic values in the table above represent the total pretax intrinsic value (the difference between our stock price on the last trading day of 2020 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money SOSARs) that would have been received by the option holders had all SOSARs been exercised on December 31, 2020. These values change based on the fair market value of our common stock. The aggregate intrinsic values of SOSARs exercised for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

--------------------------------------------- -------- -------- --------

in thousands 2020 2019 2018
Aggregate intrinsic value of SOSARs exercised $ 22,273 $ 74,838 $ 49,248

The following table presents cash and stock consideration received and tax benefit realized from SOSAR exercises and compensation cost recorded referable to SOSARs for the years ended December 31:

NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTOR AWARDS — In addition to the share-based compensation plans for employees discussed above, we issue a limited number of stock units to our nonemployee directors annually. Expense provisions referable to nonemployee director stock units amounted to $1,572,000 in 2020, $1,776,000 in 2019 and $1,965,000 in 2018.
CASH-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
We have incentive plans under which cash awards may be made annually. Expense provisions under these plans referable to awards to officers and certain employees amounted to $42,138,000 in 2020, $40,847,000 in 2019 and $36,969,000 in 2018.

Expenditures for royalties under mineral leases totaled $81,549,000 in 2020, $84,782,000 in 2019 and $76,761,000 in 2018.
As of December 31, 2020, we were contingently liable for $835,819,000 within 522 surety bonds underwritten by various surety companies. These bonds guarantee our performance and are required primarily by states and municipalities and their related agencies. The top five in amount totaled $206,015,000 (25%) and were for certain construction contracts and reclamation obligations. We have agreed to indemnify the underwriting companies against any exposure under the surety bonds. No material claims have been made against our surety bonds.
Certain of our aggregates reserves are burdened by volumetric production payments (nonoperating interest) as described in Note 2. As the holder of the working interest, we have responsibility to bear the cost of mining and producing the reserves attributable to this nonoperating interest.
As described in Note 1 under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-Insurance, our net liabilities for our self-insurance program totaled $74,135,000 as of December 31, 2020.
As summarized by purpose in Note 6, our standby letters of credit totaled $56,080,000 as of December 31, 2020.
As outlined in Note 7, our present value of future minimum (nonmineral) lease payments totaled $442,737,000 as of December 31, 2020.
As described in Note 9, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is $6,817,000 as of December 31, 2020.
As described in Note 17, our asset retirement obligations totaled $283,163,000 as of December 31, 2020.

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
We are subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to occupational safety and health or to protection of the environment, such as proceedings or orders relating to noise abatement, air emissions or water discharges. As part of our continuing program of stewardship in safety, health and environmental matters, we have been able to resolve such proceedings and to comply with such orders without any material adverse effects on our business.
We have received notices from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share in that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties.
We have reviewed the nature and extent of our involvement at each Superfund site, as well as potential obligations arising under other federal, state and local environmental laws. While ultimate resolution and financial liability is uncertain at a number of the sites, in our opinion based on information currently available, the ultimate resolution of claims and assessments related to these sites will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although amounts recorded in a given period could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for that period. Amounts accrued for environmental matters are presented in Note 8.
We are a defendant in various law

Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other Contractual Commitments We also have $7.50 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020, which are mostly related to our investments in network infrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs and data center operations. The majority of these commitments are due within five years. Legal and Related Matters Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as 103  the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the N...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Workfront Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.50 billion in cash consideration. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and issuance of these financial statements. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 79  ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42 million, which represents the difference between the $55 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $126 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $45 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remain...

[see Note 4]:
(4)Total contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties totaling $70.0 million as of November 30, 2020, because we are unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally reduces our financial risk and costs of capital associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2020, we had access to 119,283 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2020, we had $414.2 million of non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and had posted $87.5 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts. At November 30, 2020, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.0 billion (which included the $87.5 million of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November 30, 2020, we had outstanding surety bonds of $3.1 billion including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. As of November 30, 2020, there were approximately $1.6...

(5)As discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, this primarily reflects severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. (6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. As discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, the 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)This primarily reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. 28  EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjuste...

Note 18. Segment Reporting We manufacture and market primarily snack food products, including biscuits (cookies, crackers and salted snacks), chocolate, gum & candy and various cheese & grocery products, as well as powdered beverage products. We manage our global business and report operating results through geographic units. We manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale, manage different and changing business environments more effectively and pursue growth opportunities as they arise across our key markets. Our regional management teams have responsibility for the business, product categories and financial results in the regions. Our operations and management structure are organized into four operating segments: *Latin America *AMEA *Europe *North America 124  We use segment operating income to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe it is appropriate to disclose this measure to help investors analyze segment performance and trends. Segment operating income excludes unrealized gains and losses on hedging activities (which are a component of cost of sales), general corporate expenses (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses), amortization of intangible assets, gains and losses on divestitures and acquisition-related costs (which are a component of selling, general and administrative expenses) in all periods presented. We exclude these items from segment operating income in order to provide better transparency of our segment operating results. Furthermore, we centrally manage benefit plan non-service income and interest and other expense, net. Accordingly, we do not present these items by segment because they are excluded from the segment profitability measure that management reviews. Our segment net revenues and earnings, reflecting our current segment structure for all periods presented, were: ------------- -------------------------------- ------ ---- ----- ---- ------ ------ - ------ F...

[see Note 2]:
NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Following the move of our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into the Publishing segment, our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities as described in the "Business Overview" within Part I, Item 1, placing our Publishing and Advertising business in a third segment that contains some of our legacy products and solutions. We categorize our products into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, experience designers, app developers, enthusiasts, students, social media users and creative professionals, as well as marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate on and distribute documents and creative content. *Digital Experience--Our Digital Experience segment provides products, services and solutions for creating, managing, executing, measuring, monetizing and optimizing customer experiences from analyt...

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Term Loan In October 2018, we entered into a credit agreement providing a $2.25 billion senior unsecured term loan ("Term Loan") with a maturity date of April 30, 2020. The Term Loan ranked equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. There were no scheduled principal amortization payments prior to maturity and the Term Loan could be prepaid and terminated at our election at any time without penalty or premium. At our election, the Term Loan bore interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. The related issuance costs were amortized to interest expense over the Term Loan period using the effective interest method.

Note 8.Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, data centers, land, colocations, and equipment. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements for certain network equipment. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2021 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Note 11. Stockholders' Equity Convertible Preferred Stock Our Board of Directors has authorized 100 million shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, no shares were issued or outstanding. Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock Our Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock. Share Repurchases In July 2020, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $28.0 billion of its Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 15.3 million and 21.5 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $18.4 billion and $31.1 billion, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights ("IP rights") During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred in April and November 2020, respectively. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized over the period of economic benefit.

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Following the move of our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into the Publishing segment, our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities as described in the "Business Overview" within Part I, Item 1, placing our Publishing and Advertising business in a third segment that contains some of our legacy products and solutions. We categorize our products into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, experience designers, app developers, enthusiasts, students, social media users and creative professionals, as well as marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate on and distribute documents and creative content. *Digital Experience--Our Digital Experience segment provides products, services and solutions for creating, managing, executing, measuring, monetizing and optimizing customer experiences from analyt...

(5)As discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, this primarily reflects severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. (6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. As discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, the 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)This primarily reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. 28  EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjuste...

(4)Total contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties totaling $70.0 million as of November 30, 2020, because we are unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally reduces our financial risk and costs of capital associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2020, we had access to 119,283 homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2020, we had $414.2 million of non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and had posted $87.5 million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts. At November 30, 2020, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1.0 billion (which included the $87.5 million of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November 30, 2020, we had outstanding surety bonds of $3.1 billion including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. As of November 30, 2020, there were approximately $1.6...

[' nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The fair values of these investments are estimated using a market approach. The Level 1 investments include mutual funds for which quoted prices in active markets are available. Level 2 investments are stated at estimated fair value based on the underlying investments in the fund (short-term, highly liquid assets in commercial paper, short-term bonds and certificates of deposit).
Net gains (losses) of the Rabbi Trusts’ investments were $4,469,000, $3,993,000 and $(2,741,000) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The portions of the net gains (losses) related to investments still held by the Rabbi Trusts at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $4,140,000, $3,729,000 and $(4,386,000), respectively.
The carrying values of our cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts and notes receivable, short-term debt, trade payables and accruals, and all other current liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Additional disclosures for derivative instruments and interest-bearing debt are presented in Notes 5 and 6, respectively.

 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill totaled $3,172,112,000 as compared to $3,167,061,000 at December 31, 2019. Goodwill represents 27% of total assets at December 31, 2020 compared to 30% at December 31, 2019.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, as of November 1, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, one level below our operating segments. We have four operating segments organized around our principal product lines: Aggregates, Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium. Within these four operating segments, we have identified 17 reporting units (of which 9 carry goodwill) based primarily on geographic location. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a quantitative test. We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.
The quantitative impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess.
The results of the annual impairment tests performed as of November 1, 2020, 2019 and 2018 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values. Accordingly, there were no charges for goodwill impairment in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.
We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach (which involves discounting estimated future cash flows) and a market approach (which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies). Determining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects, which may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results, could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.
For additional information about goodwill see Note 18.

 IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Fair value is determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.
We test long-lived assets for impairment at the a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g., asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) determines the profitability of the downstream business.
As of December 31, 2020, net property, plant & equipment represents 38% of total assets, while net other intangible assets represents 10% of total assets. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded no material losses on impairment of long-lived assets.
For additional information about long-lived assets and intangible assets see Notes 4 and 18, respectively.

 REVENUES AND REVENUE RECOGNITION
Total revenues include sales of product and services to customers, net of any discounts and taxes, and freight and delivery revenues billed to customers. Freight and delivery generally represent pass-through transportation we incur (including our administrative costs) and pay to third-party carriers to deliver our products to customers. The cost related to freight and delivery is included in cost of revenues.
Revenues for product sales are recognized when control passes to the customer (typically occurs when finished products are shipped/delivered). Construction paving revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.
For additional information regarding revenues and revenue recognition see Note 2.
 STRIPPING COSTS
In the mining industry, the costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral deposits are referred to as stripping costs.
Stripping costs incurred during the production phase are considered costs of extracted minerals under our inventory costing system, inventoried, and recognized in cost of sales in the same period as the revenue from the sale of the inventory. The production stage is deemed to begin when the activities, including removal of overburden and waste material that may contain incidental saleable material, required to access the saleable product are complete. Stripping costs considered as production costs and included in the costs of inventory produced were $90,432,000 in 2020, $86,090,000 in 2019 and $78,911,000 in 2018.
Conversely, stripping costs incurred during the development stage of a mine (pre-production stripping) are excluded from our inventory cost. Pre-production stripping costs are capitalized and reported within other noncurrent assets in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized pre-production stripping costs are expensed over the productive life of the mine using the unit-of-sales method. Pre-production stripping costs included in other noncurrent assets were $92,880,000 as of December 31, 2020 and $92,759,000 as of December 31, 2019.

 RECLAMATION COSTS
Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term when there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.
To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost (including a reasonable profit margin) for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.
In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.
We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.
The carrying value of these obligations was $283,163,000 as of December 31, 2020 and $210,323,000 as of December 31, 2019. For additional information about reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations) see Note 17.

 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
Our environmental compliance costs are undiscounted and include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. We accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost. At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than the completion of the remedial feasibility study.
When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. If no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 2020, the spread between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $5,905,000 — this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. However, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.
For additional information about environmental compliance costs see Note 8.

We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, students, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model or a managed services model, both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based, as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, independent software vendors, retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia-Pacific ("APAC"). Basis of Presentation The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and...

['s largest supplier of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel) and a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.
We operate primarily in the United States and our principal product — aggregates — is used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. We serve markets in twenty states, Washington D.C., and the local markets surrounding our operations in Mexico. Our primary focus is serving metropolitan markets in the United States that are expected to experience the most significant growth in population, households and employment. These three demographic factors are significant drivers of demand for aggregates. While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete in our Alabama, Arizona, California, Maryland, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington D.C. markets.
While we continue to operate as an essential business, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our industry and the economy, and it may have far-reaching impacts on many aspects of our operations, directly and indirectly, including with respect to its impacts on customer behaviors, business and manufacturing operations, our employees, and the market generally.
Due to the 2005 sale of our Chemicals business as described below, the results of the Chemicals business are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

 PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vulcan Materials Company and all our majority or
‎wholly-owned subsidiary companies. Partially-owned affiliates are either consolidated or accounted for at cost or as equity investments depending on the level of ownership interest or our ability to exercise control over the affiliates’ operations. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
 USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted (GAAP) in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. The most significant estimates included in the preparation of these financial statements are related to goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, business combinations and purchase price allocation, pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental compliance, claims and litigation including self-insurance, and income taxes. Events and changes in circumstances arising after December 31, 2020, including those resulting from the impacts of COVID-19, will be reflected in management’s estimates for future periods.
 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of consideration transferred to and liabilities assumed from the seller as of the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction, and therefore represents an exit price. A fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants.
We may adjust the amounts recognized in an acquisition during a measurement period after the acquisition date. Any such adjustments are the result of subsequently obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to goodwill, if any, recognized in the transaction. The cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on depreciation, amortization and other income statement items are recognized in the period the adjustment is determined.
 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of our operations. For our non-U.S. subsidiaries, local currency inventories and long-term assets such as property, plant & equipment and intangibles are remeasured into U.S. dollars at approximate rates prevailing when acquired; all other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Inventories charged to cost of sales and depreciation are remeasured at historical rates; all other income and expense items are remeasured at average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Gains and losses which result from remeasurement are included in other nonoperating income/expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and are not material for the years presented.
 CASH EQUIVALENTS
We classify as cash equivalents all highly liquid securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities.
 RESTRICTED CASH
Restricted cash generally consists of cash proceeds from the sale of property held in escrow for the acquisition of replacement property under like-kind exchange agreements and cash reserved by other contractual agreements (such as asset purchase agreements) for a specified purpose and therefore not available for use for other purposes. The escrow accounts are administered by an intermediary. Cash restricted pursuant to like-kind exchange agreements remains restricted for a maximum of 180 days from the date of the property sale pending the acquisition of replacement property. Restricted cash is included with cash and cash equivalents in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
 ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE
Accounts and notes receivable from customers result from our extending credit to trade customers for the purchase of our products. The terms generally provide for payment within 15 days of the month following invoice. On occasion, when necessary to conform to regional industry practices, we sell product under extended payment terms, which may result in either secured or unsecured short-term notes; or, on occasion, notes with durations of less than one year are taken in settlement of existing accounts receivable. Other accounts and notes receivable result from short-term transactions (less than one year) other than the sale of our products, such as interest receivable, insurance claims, freight claims, bid deposits or rents receivable.
Allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts. We regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. Bad debt expense for the years ended December 31 was as follows: 2020 — $1,091,000, 2019 — $1,426,000 and 2018 — $251,000. Write-offs of accounts receivables for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 2020 — $2,046,000, 2019 — $809,000 and 2018 — $1,291,000.

 INVENTORIES
Inventories and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuation for most of our inventories because it results in a better matching of costs with revenues. Such costs include fuel, parts and supplies, raw materials, direct labor and production overhead. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on our estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. Substantially all operating supplies inventory is carried at average cost.
For additional information about inventories see Note 3.
 PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT
Property, plant & equipment (including finance leases) are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization.
Capitalized software costs of $2,110,000 and $2,976,000 are reflected in net property, plant & equipment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We capitalized software costs for the years ended December 31 as follows: 2020 — $1,116,000, 2019 — $1,506,000 and 2018 — $2,213,000.
For assets sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed, and any related gain or loss is reflected in income.For additional information about our property, plant & equipment see Note 4.

 REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE
Repair and maintenance costs generally are charged to operating expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments that add materially to the utility or useful lives of property, plant & equipment are capitalized and subsequently depreciated. Actual costs for planned major maintenance activities, related primarily to periodic overhauls on our oceangoing vessels, are capitalized and amortized to the next overhaul.
 LEASES
Our nonmineral leases with initial terms in excess of one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities. Mineral leases are exempt from balance sheet recognition.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The lease term only includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets are adjusted for any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives. Except for equipment with monthly monitoring service where the service component accounts for a majority of the lease cost, the non-lease components of our lease agreements are not separated from the lease components.

For additional information about leases see Note 7.
 DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION, ACCRETION AND AMORTIZATION
Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method at rates based on the estimated service lives of the various classes of assets, which include machinery and equipment (3 to 35 years), buildings (7 to 20 years) and land improvements (3 to 20 years). Finance leases are amortized over varying periods not in excess of applicable lease terms or estimated useful lives. Capitalized software costs are included in machinery and equipment and are depreciated on a straight-line basis beginning when the software project is substantially complete.
Cost depletion on depletable land is computed by the unit-of-sales method based on estimated recoverable units.
Accretion reflects the period-to-period increase in the carrying amount of the liability for asset retirement obligations. It is computed using the same credit-adjusted, risk-free rate used to initially measure the liability at fair value.
Leaseholds are amortized over varying periods not in excess of applicable lease terms or estimated useful lives.
Amortization of intangible assets subject to amortization is computed based on the estimated life of the intangible assets.
‎A significant portion of our intangible assets is contractual rights in place associated with zoning, permitting and other rights to access and extract aggregates reserves. Contractual rights in place associated with aggregates reserves are amortized using the unit-of-sales method based on estimated recoverable units. Other intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method.

 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
During the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. From time to time, and consistent with our risk management policies, we use derivative instruments to balance the cost and risk of such expenses. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.
The accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationship. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swap cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and are reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. We may also enter into contracts that qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales (NPNS) exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, we apply such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract’s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.
For additional information about derivative instruments see Note 5.
 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as described below:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
‎Level 2: Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data
‎Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement

NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information ​ 3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M's four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown. ​ Effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated for all periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments. ​ 133  3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in "Elimination of Dual Credit"). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in "Corporate and Unallocated"). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/be...
