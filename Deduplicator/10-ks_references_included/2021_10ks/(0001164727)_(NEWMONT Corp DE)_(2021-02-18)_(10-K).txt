Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Securities and Exchange Commission Rules
Accounting for Equity Securities, Investments and Certain Forward Contracts and Options
In January 2020, ASU No. 2020-01 was issued which clarifies the interaction in accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting in Topic 323 and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under Topic 815. This update is effective in fiscal years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has evaluated this guidance and does not expect it to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures. The Company adopted the new guidance prospectively on January 1, 2021.
Effects of Reference Rate Reform
In March 2020, ASU No. 2020-04 was issued which provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden on accounting for contract modifications caused by reference rate reform. This guidance is effective for all entities and is to be adopted by December 31, 2022. The guidance may be adopted over time as reference rate reform activities occur and should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company is still completing its evaluation of the impact of ASU 2020-04 and plans to elect optional expedients as reference rate reform activities occur. The Company does not expect the guidance to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures.
Financial Disclosures about Acquired and Disposed Businesses
In May 2020, the SEC finalized its proposed updates to Rule 3-05 within Regulation S-X, Financial statements of businesses acquired or to be acquired, Rule 3-14, Special instructions for real estate operations to be acquired; Article 11, Pro Forma Financial Information; and other related rules and forms (the “Rules”). The Rules include amendments, which among other things: revise significance tests used to determine disclosure requirements; require the financial statements of the acquired business to cover only up to the two most recent fiscal years; permit the use of, or reconciliation to, International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board in certain circumstances; and amend certain pro forma financial information requirements. The Rules are effective on January 1, 2021 and voluntary compliance prior to the effective date is permitted. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements or disclosures.

 BUSINESS ACQUISITION
On January 14, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (as amended by the first amendment to the arrangement agreement, dated as of February 19, 2019, the “Arrangement Agreement”) to acquire all outstanding shares of Goldcorp, Inc. (“Goldcorp”), an Ontario corporation. On April 18, 2019 (“acquisition date”), pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, Newmont completed the business acquisition of Goldcorp, in which Newmont was the acquirer. The acquisition of Goldcorp increased the Company’s gold and other metal reserves and expanded the operating jurisdictions.
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of the following:

Newmont stock issued (285 million shares at $33.04 per share) $ 9,423
------------------------------------------------------------- -- -----
Cash paid to Goldcorp shareholders 17
Other non-cash consideration 16
Total consideration $ 9,456

The Company retained an independent appraiser to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price of Goldcorp has been allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated acquisition date fair values. The fair value estimates were based on income, market and cost valuation methods. The excess of the total consideration over the estimated fair value of the amounts initially assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill balance is mainly attributable to: (i) the acquisition of existing operating mines with access to an assembled workforce that cannot be duplicated at the same costs by new entrants; (ii) operating synergies anticipated from the integration of the operations of Newmont and Goldcorp; (iii) the application of Newmont’s Full Potential program and potential strategic and financial benefits that include the increase in reserve base and opportunities to identify additional mineralization through exploration activities; and (iv) the financial flexibility to execute capital priorities.

In April 2020, the Company completed the analysis to assign fair values to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation for the Newmont Goldcorp transaction:

Assets:
------------------------------------------- ------ -----
Cash and cash equivalents $ 117
Trade receivables 95
Investments 169
Equity method investments (1) 2,796
Inventories 500
Stockpiles and ore on leach pads 57
Property, plant & mine development (2) 11,054
Goodwill (3) 2,550
Deferred income tax assets (4) 206
Other assets 508
Total assets 18,052
Liabilities:
Debt (5) 3,304
Accounts payable 240
Employee-related benefits 190
Income and mining taxes payable 20
Lease and other financing obligations 423
Reclamation and remediation liabilities (6) 897
Deferred income tax liabilities (4) 1,430
Silver streaming agreement (7) 1,165
Other liabilities (8) 927
Total liabilities 8,596
Net assets acquired $ 9,456

____________________________
(1)The fair value of the equity method investments was determined by applying the income valuation method. The income valuation method relies on a discounted cash flow model and projected financial results. Discount rates for the discounted cash flow models are based on capital structures for similar market participants and included various risk premiums that account for risks associated with the specific investments.
(2)The fair value of property, plant and mine development is based on applying the income and cost valuation methods and includes a provision for the estimated fair value of asset retirement obligations related to the long-lived tangible assets.
(3)Goodwill attributable to the North America and South America reportable segments is $2,091 and $459, respectively. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company reclassified $84 of goodwill previously allocated to the Red Lake reporting unit, and included in Assets held for sale as of December 31, 2019, to other reporting units in the North America reportable segment as a result of refinements to deferred tax liability allocations during the first quarter that existed at the acquisition date. The Company disposed $47 of goodwill remaining at Red Lake on March 31, 2020 as part of the Red Lake Sale. See Note 10 for additional information.
(4)Deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax benefit or future tax expense associated with the differences between the fair value allocated to assets (excluding goodwill) and liabilities and the historical carryover tax basis of these assets and liabilities. No deferred tax liability is recognized for the basis difference inherent in the fair value allocated to goodwill.
(5)The fair value of the Goldcorp Senior Notes is measured using a market approach, based on quoted prices for the acquired debt; $1,250 of borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit agreements approximate fair value.
(6)The fair value of reclamation and remediation liabilities is based on the expected amounts and timing of cash flows for closure activities and discounted to present value using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate as of the acquisition date. Key assumptions include the costs and timing of key closure activities based on the life of mine plans, including estimates and timing of monitoring and water management costs (if applicable) after the completion of initial closure activities.
(7)The fair value of the acquired silver streaming intangible liability is valued by using the income valuation method. Key assumptions in the income valuation method include long-term silver prices, level of silver production over the life of mine and discount rates.
(8)Other liabilities includes the balance of $450 related to unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties.

 SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company regularly reviews its segment reporting for alignment with its strategic goals and operational structure as well as for evaluation of business performance and allocation of resources by Newmont’s Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"). In the second quarter of 2019, following the close of the Newmont Goldcorp transaction on April 18, 2019, and in anticipation of the formation of NGM effective July 1, 2019, the Company revised its operating segments and established the Nevada reportable segment to reflect certain changes in the financial information regularly reviewed by the CODM. The Company determined that its operations are organized into five geographic regions: North America, South America, Australia, Africa and Nevada, which also represent Newmont’s reportable and operating segments.
As a result of the Newmont Goldcorp transaction, the Company acquired the Red Lake, Musselwhite, Porcupine, Éléonore and Peñasquito mines, which are included in the North America reportable segment, and the Cerro Negro mine, which is included in the South America reportable segment. Additionally, the Company acquired interests in the Pueblo Viejo mine, the Norte Abierto project, the NuevaUnión project and the Alumbrera mine, which are all accounted for as equity method investments. The Company’s investment in the Pueblo Viejo mine is included in the South America reportable segment within Other South America. All other equity method investments are included in Corporate and other. Refer to Note 10 and 20 for additional information on sales of Red Lake and the investment in Alumbrera mine.
The Company’s Nevada reportable segment included the Carlin, Phoenix, Twin Creeks and Long Canyon mines (“existing Nevada mining operations”). On July 1, 2019, ("the effective date") the Company contributed its existing Nevada mining operations in exchange for a 38.5% ownership interest in Nevada Gold Mines (“NGM”). See Note 32 for further information.
Notwithstanding the reportable segments structure, the Company internally reports information on a mine-by-mine basis for each mining operation and has chosen to disclose this information in the following tables. Income (loss) before income and mining tax and other items from reportable segments does not reflect general corporate expenses, interest (except project-specific interest) or income and mining taxes. Intercompany revenue and expense amounts have been eliminated within each segment in order to report on the basis that management uses internally for evaluating segment performance. Newmont’s business activities that are not included within the reportable segments are included in Corporate and Other. Although they are not required to be included in this footnote, they are provided for reconciliation purposes. The financial information relating to the Company’s segments is as follows:

Sales from concentrate and other production 390 346
Total receivables from Sales $ 449 $ 373

Provisional Sales
The Company sells gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc concentrates on a provisional basis. Provisional concentrate sales contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which is not designated for hedge accounting treatment, is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement.
The impact to Sales from revenue recognized due to the changes in pricing is an increase (decrease) of $80, $22 and $(9) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
At December 31, 2020, Newmont had gold sales of 224,000 ounces priced at an average of $1,890 per ounce, copper sales of 12 million pounds priced at an average price of $3.52 per pound, silver sales of 4 million ounces priced at an average of $26.50 per ounce, lead sales of 25 million pounds priced at an average of $0.90 per pound, and zinc sales of 54 million pounds priced at an average of $1.24 per pound, subject to final pricing over the next several months.
Silver Streaming Agreement
As a part of the Newmont Goldcorp transaction, the Company assumed the Silver streaming agreement liability related to silver production from the Peñasquito mine in the North America segment. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company is obligated to sell 25% of silver production from the Peñasquito mine to Wheaton Precious Metals Corporation at the lesser of market price or a fixed contract price, subject to an annual inflation adjustment of up to 1.65%. This agreement contains off-market terms and was initially recognized at its acquisition date fair value as a finite-lived intangible liability. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the valuation methodology and initial fair value. The Company’s policy is to amortize the liability into Sales each period using the units-of-production method. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company amortized $67, $37, and $—, respectively, of the Silver streaming agreement liability into revenue. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the value of the liability included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet was $1,060 and $1,127, respectively.

Revenue by Major Customer
As gold can be sold through numerous gold market traders worldwide, the Company is not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product. In 2020, sales to JPMorgan Chase were $2,775 (24%) and Standard Chartered were $2,737 (24%) of total gold sales. In 2019, sales to Standard Chartered were $2,907 (30%), JPMorgan Chase were $1,780 (18%), Toronto Dominion Bank were $1,204 (12%) of total gold sales.

The Company sells silver, lead, zinc and copper predominantly in the form of concentrates which are sold directly to smelters located in Asia and to a lesser extent North America and Europe. The concentrates are sold under long-term supply contracts with processing fees based on the demand for these concentrates in the global market place.

 RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATIONThe Company’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various domestic and international laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. The Company conducts its operations to protect public health and the environment and believes its operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. The Company has made, and expects to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. Estimated future reclamation and remediation costs are based principally on current legal and regulatory requirements.
The Company’s Reclamation and remediation expense consisted of:

Years Ended December 31,
--------------------------------- ---- ---- --- -- --- --
 2020 2019 2018
Reclamation adjustments and other $ 180 $ 77 $ 33
Reclamation accretion 134 133 99
Total reclamation expense 314 210 132
Remediation adjustments and other 46 65 26
Remediation accretion 6 5 5
Total remediation expense 52 70 31
 $ 366 $ 280 $ 163

In 2020, reclamation adjustments primarily related to increased lime consumption and water treatment costs at inactive Yanacocha sites and an update of the project cost estimates at inactive Porcupine sites that resulted in increases of $152 and $16, respectively. In 2019, reclamation adjustments primarily related to updated water management costs at inactive Yanacocha sites and an update of the project cost estimates at Mule Canyon and Northumberland mine sites that resulted in increases of $62, $9 and $4, respectively. In 2018, reclamation adjustments primarily related to increased water management costs for operations no longer in production at Yanacocha of $14, a revision in the closure plan for Lone Tree, resulting in increased monitoring costs of $7, and increased water management costs of $9 for operations no longer in production at Carlin.
In 2020, remediation adjustments primarily related to project execution delays due to COVID-19 and updated project cost estimates at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites of $27 and other remediation project spend at other sites. In 2019, remediation adjustments primarily related to updated project cost estimates at the Midnite mine and Dawn mill sites and increased water management cost estimates at Con mine that resulted in increases of $36 and $9, respectively. In 2018, remediation adjustments related to updated assumptions for future water management costs at the Idarado remediation site, increased costs for project activities at the Woodcutters remediation site, and increased water management costs at the Resurrection remediation site that resulted in increases of $8, $2 and $2, respectively.
The following are reconciliations of Reclamation and remediation liabilities:

Impairments relate to non-cash write-downs of various assets that are no longer in use.
In 2018, impairments related to certain exploration properties of $331 and Emigrant, within the Carlin complex, of $35, both reported in the Nevada segment. The Company determined that an impairment indicator existed at certain Nevada exploration properties, due to the Company’s decision to focus on advancing other projects, and at Emigrant, due to a change in the mine plan that resulted in a significant decrease in mine life. In addition to the impairment of long-lived assets at Emigrant, the Company also recorded an adjustment to the carrying value of the ore on leach pads resulting from the change in mine plan, impacting Costs applicable to sales and Depreciation and amortization in 2018 by $22 and $7, respectively.
As a result of the impairment indicators, recoverability tests were performed and the Company concluded the Property, plant and mine development, net at certain Nevada exploration properties and Emigrant was impaired. The Company measured the impairment at the Nevada exploration properties using the market approach. The Company measured the impairment at Emigrant by comparing the total fair value of existing operations using the income approach. Refer to Note 19 for detail of the assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the long-lived assets tested for impairment.

Factors that Significantly Impact Effective Tax Rate
Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed the tax basis in the mineral reserves) are available to the Company under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through
branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in the consolidated United States income tax return. These deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company.
The Company operates in various jurisdictions around the world that have statutory tax rates that are significantly different than those of the U.S. These differences combine to move the overall effective tax rate higher than the U.S. statutory rate.
Mining taxes in Nevada, Mexico, Canada, Peru and Australia represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits.
Components of the Company's deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

At December 31,
--------------------------------------------------------- ------- ------- ----- -------
 2020 2019
Deferred income tax assets:
Property, plant and mine development $ 996 $ 1,001

Other (42) (53)
 (3,181) (3,290)
Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ (1,736) $ (1,858)

These amounts reflect the classification and presentation that is reported for each tax jurisdiction in which the Company operates.
Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets
The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the recent pretax losses and/or expectations of future pretax losses. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance has been recorded in Peru. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present or if additional weight were given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.
During 2020, the Company recorded additional valuation allowance of $186 to tax expense. There were additional valuation allowance increases related to other components of the financial statements of $120.
Refer to Note 2 for additional risk factors that could impact the Company’s ability to realize the deferred tax assets.
Tax Loss Carryforwards, Foreign Tax Credits, Canadian Tax Credits, and AMT Credits
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had (i) 1,726 and $1,754 of net operating loss carry forwards, respectively; and (ii) $659 and $658 of tax credit carry forwards, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, $502 and $504, respectively, of net operating loss carry forwards are attributable to the U.S., Australia and France for which current tax law provides no expiration period. The net operating loss carry forward in Canada of $905 will expire by 2040. The net operating loss carryforward in Argentina of $95 will expire in 2026. The net operating loss carryforward in Mexico of $155 will expire in 2030. The net operating loss carry forward in other countries is $69.
Tax credit carry forwards for 2020 and 2019 of $510 and $489, respectively, consist of foreign tax credits available in the United States; substantially all such credits not utilized will expire at the end of 2031. Canadian tax credits for 2020 and 2019 of $149 and $134, respectively, consist of investment tax credits and minimum mining tax credits. Canadian investment tax credits of $86 will substantially expire by 2035 and the other Canadian tax credits of $63 do not expire.
Company’s Unrecognized Tax Benefits
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, is as follows:

 2020 2019 2018
-------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- --- - --
Total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 326 $ 43 $ 68
Additions due to acquisition of Goldcorp — 350 —
Additions (reductions) for tax positions of prior years (33) 1 1
Additions for tax positions of current year 4 34 2
Reductions due to settlements with taxing authorities (58) (102) (28)
Reductions due to lapse of statute of limitations (2) — —
Total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 237 $ 326 $ 43

At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $369, $459 and $11, respectively, represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits, inclusive of interest and penalties that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective income tax rate.
The Company operates in numerous countries around the world and is subject to, and pays annual income taxes under, the various income tax regimes in the countries in which it operates. Some of these tax regimes are defined by contractual agreements with the local government, and others are defined by the general corporate income tax laws of the country. The Company has historically filed, and continues to file, all required income tax returns and paid the taxes reasonably determined to be due. The tax rules and regulations in many countries are highly complex and subject to interpretation. From time to time, the Company is subject to a review of its historic income tax filings and in connection with such reviews, disputes can arise with the taxing authorities over the interpretation or application of certain rules to the Company’s business conducted within the country involved.
The Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) is conducting a limited review of the Company’s prior year tax returns. The ATO is focused on reviewing an internal reorganization executed in 2011 when Newmont completed a restructure of the shareholding in the Company’s Australian subsidiaries. To date, the Company has responded to inquiries from the ATO and provided them with supporting documentation for the transaction and the Company’s associated tax positions. One aspect of the ATO review relates to an Australian capital gains tax that applies to sales or transfers of stock in certain types of entities. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the ATO notified the Company that it believes the 2011 reorganization is subject to capital gains tax of approximately $83 (including interest and penalties). The Company disputes this conclusion and intends to vigorously defend its position that the transaction is not subject to this tax. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made a $25 payment to the ATO and lodged an Appeal with the Australian Federal Court to preserve its right to contest the ATO conclusions on this matter. The Company reflects this payment as a receivable as it believes that it will ultimately prevail in this dispute. The Company continues to monitor the status of the ATO’s review which it expects to continue into 2021.
The Company and/or subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2014. As a result of (i) statute of limitations that will begin to expire within the next 12 months in various jurisdictions, and (ii) possible settlements of audit-related issues with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of its unrecognized income tax liability will decrease between $100 and $150 in the next 12 months.
The Company’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its income and mining tax expense. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total amount of accrued income-tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $146 and $166, respectively. During 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company released $20, accrued $29, and released $17 of interest and penalties, respectively, through the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Other
No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.

Holt royalty obligation and option $ 137 $ (84) $ 57
Batu Hijau contingent consideration and other 26 12 4
Net income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 163 $ (72) $ 61

The Holt Royalty Obligation and Option
Discontinued operations include a retained royalty obligation (“Holt royalty obligation”) to Royal Gold, Inc. for production on the Holt-McDermott property owned by Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd ("Kirkland"). The Holt royalty obligation equals 0.013% of net smelter returns multiplied by the quarterly average gold price, minus a 0.013% of net smelter returns. In 2020, the Company and Kirkland signed a Strategic Alliance Agreement (the “Kirkland Agreement”). As part of the Kirkland Agreement, the Company purchased an option (the “Holt option”) from Kirkland for the mining and mineral rights subject to the Holt royalty obligation for $75, effectively reducing the Holt royalty obligation to $—. If exercised, the Holt option will allow the Company to prevent Kirkland from mining minerals subject to the Holt royalty obligation.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the estimated fair value of the Holt royalty obligation was $— and $257, respectively. Changes to the estimated fair value resulting from periodic revaluations are recorded to Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax. For the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded a gain (loss) of $137, $(84) and $57, net of a tax benefit (expense) of $(37), $22 and $(15), respectively, related to the Holt royalty obligation. The Company paid $8, $10 and $10 for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the Holt royalty obligation. Refer to Note 19 for additional information on the Holt royalty obligation.
Batu Hijau Contingent Consideration
Consideration received by the Company in conjunction with the sale of PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara in 2016 included certain contingent payment provisions that were determined to be financial instruments that met the definition of a derivative, but do not qualify for hedge accounting, under ASC 815. For the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded a gain of $26, $12 and $4, net of a tax benefit (expense) of $(7), $(3) and $(1), respectively. See contingent consideration assets in Note 19 for additional information.

(1)Included in Yanacocha is $(13), $— and $(1) gain (loss) attributable to the Contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Newmont has a 75.0% economic interest in Suriname Gold project C.V. (“Merian”), with the remaining interests held by Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (“Staatsolie”), a company wholly owned by the Republic of Suriname. Newmont consolidates Merian, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Newmont Suriname LLC., in its Consolidated Financial Statements as the primary beneficiary of Merian, which is a variable interest entity.
Newmont has a 51.35% ownership interest in Yanacocha, with 43.65% owned by Buenaventura and 5% owned by Summit Global Management II VB, a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation (“Sumitomo”). Under the terms of Sumitomo's acquisition of its 5% interest in 2018 for $48 in cash, Sumitomo has the option to require Yanacocha to repurchase the interest for $48 if the Yanacocha Sulfides project does not adequately progress by June 2022 or if the project is approved with an internal rate of return below a contractually agreed upon rate. Consequently, Sumitomo’s interest has been classified outside of permanent equity as Contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the terms of the sales agreement, the cash paid by Sumitomo at closing has been placed in escrow for repayment in the event the option is exercised. The Company continues to consolidate Yanacocha in its Consolidated Financial Statements under the voting interest model.

 NEWMONT EQUITY AND NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE
Newmont Common Stock
In September 2018, Newmont filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 under which it can issue an indeterminate number or amount of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, guarantees of debt securities and warrants from time to time at indeterminate prices, subject to the limitations of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certification of incorporation and our bylaws. It also includes the ability to resell an indeterminate amount of common stock, preferred stock and debt securities from time to time upon exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible securities.
In order to consummate the Newmont Goldcorp transaction, the Company amended its Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase Newmont’s authorized number of shares of common stock from 750 million to 1.28 billion, as approved by Newmont shareholders at the April 11, 2019 special meeting of stockholders.
Net Income (Loss) per Common Share
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income available to Newmont common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed similarly, except that weighted average common shares is increased to reflect all dilutive instruments, including employee stock awards. The dilutive effects of Newmont’s dilutive securities are calculated using the treasury stock method.

Pension and Other Benefit Plans
The Company provides defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Benefits are generally based on years of service and the employee’s average annual compensation. Various international pension plans are based on local laws and requirements. Pension costs are determined annually by independent actuaries and pension contributions to the qualified plans are made based on funding standards established under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
The following tables provide a reconciliation of changes in the plans’ benefit obligations and assets’ fair values for 2020 and 2019:

Fair value of assets at end of year $ 986 $ 1,145 $ — $ —
Unfunded status, net $ 131 $ 122 $ 90 $ 86

The Company’s qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with Internal Revenue Service rules and regulations. The Company’s non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. The information contained in the above tables presents the combined funded status of qualified and non-qualified plans. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, all pension benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of assets. The Company reviews its retirement benefit programs on a regular basis and will consider market conditions and the funded status of its qualified pension plans in determining whether additional contributions are appropriate in calendar year 2021.
The significant assumptions used in measuring the Company’s benefit obligation were mortality assumptions and discount rate.
The mortality assumptions used to measure the pension and other post retirement obligation incorporate future mortality improvements from tables published by the Society of Actuaries. The Company utilized the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2019 generational projection scale to measure the pension and other post retirement obligations as of December 31, 2019. In October 2020, the Society of Actuaries released a new generational projection scale, MP-2020. The Company utilized the Pri-2012 mortality tables and the MP-2020 generational projection scales to measure the pension and other post retirement obligations as of December 31, 2020.
Yield curves matching the Company’s benefit obligations were derived using a model based on high quality corporate bond data from Bloomberg. The model develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose projected cash flows match the projected benefit payments of the plan. The resulting curves were used to identify a weighted average discount rate for the Company of 2.77% and 3.49% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, based on the timing of future benefit payments.
Actuarial losses (gains) of $109 were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in discount rate from the prior year. Actuarial losses (gains) of $147 were recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate from the prior year.
Settlement accounting is required when annual lump sum payments exceed the annual interest and service costs for a plan and results in a remeasurement of the related pension benefit obligation and plan assets and the recognition of settlement charges in Other Income, net due to the acceleration of a portion of unrecognized actuarial losses. The lump sum payments were made primarily from the plan assets resulting in a pension settlement charge of $92 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
The following table provides the net pension and other benefits amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31:

Actuarial losses in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining future service period of the current active participants.
The significant assumptions used in measuring the Company’s Total benefit cost (credit) and other comprehensive income (loss) were discount rate and expected return on plan assets:

Years Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31,
 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018
Weighted average assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost:
Discount rate 3.49 % 4.40 % 3.77 % 3.49 % 4.40 % 3.77 %
Expected return on plan assets 6.75 % 6.75 % 7.25 % N/A N/A N/A

The expected long-term return on plan assets used for each period in the three years ended December 31, 2020 was determined based on an analysis of the asset returns over multiple time horizons for the Company’s actual plan and for other comparable U.S. corporations. At December 31, 2020, Newmont has estimated the expected long-term return on plan assets to be 6.75% which will be used in determining future net periodic benefit cost. The Company determines the long-term return on plan assets by considering the most recent capital market forecasts, the plans’ current asset allocation and the actual return on plan assets in comparison to the expected return on assets. The average actual return on plan assets during the 32 years ended December 31, 2020 approximated 8.47%.
Newmont has two pension calculations for salaried U.S. employees. The first is a “Final Average Pay” pension calculation which pays a monthly amount to employees in retirement based, in part, on their highest five year eligible earnings and years of credited service. The second is the “Stable Value” calculation which provides a lump sum payment to employees upon retirement. The amount of the lump sum is the total of annual accruals based on the employee’s eligible earnings and years of service. The benefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula were frozen on June 30, 2014 for those eligible employees. Beginning July 1, 2014, all future accruals are based on the terms and features of the Stable Value calculation.
The pension plans employ an independent investment firm which invests the assets of the plans in certain approved funds that correspond to specific asset classes with associated target allocations. The goal of the pension fund investment program is to achieve prudent actuarial funding ratios while maintaining acceptable risk levels. The investment performance of the plans and that of the individual investment firms is measured against recognized market indices. The performance of the pension funds are monitored by an investment committee comprised of members of the Company’s management, which is advised by an independent investment consultant. With the exception of global capital market economic risks, the Company has identified no significant portfolio risks associated to asset classes. The following is a summary of the target asset allocations for 2020 and the actual asset allocation at December 31, 2020.

The following table sets forth the Company’s pension plan assets measured at fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019:

Fair Value at December 31,
-------------------------- ---- ----- ----- -
 2020 2019
Plan Assets:
Cash and cash equivalents $ 5 $ 4
Commingled funds 981 1,141
 $ 986 $ 1,145

Cash and cash equivalent instruments are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets, which are primarily invested in money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.
The pension plans’ commingled fund investments are managed by several fund managers and are valued at the net asset value per share for each fund. Although the majority of the underlying assets in the funds consist of actively traded equity securities and bonds, the unit of account is considered to be at the fund level. These funds require less than a month’s notice for redemptions and can be redeemed at the net asset value per share.
The assumed health care trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits is 6.00% in 2021 and decreases gradually each year to 5.00% in 2025, which is used thereafter.
Cash Flows
Benefit payments expected to be paid to pension plan participants are as follows: $62 in 2021, $64 in 2022, $67 in 2023, $67 in 2024, $67 in 2025 and $334 in total over the five years from 2026 through 2030. Benefit payments made to other benefit plan participants are expected to be as follows: $6 in 2021, $6 in 2022, $6 in 2023, $6 in 2024, $6 in 2025 and $26 in total over the five years from 2026 through 2030.
Savings Plans
The Company has two qualified defined contribution savings plans in the U.S.: one that covers salaried and non-union hourly employees and one that covers substantially all hourly union employees. In addition, the Company has one non-qualified supplemental savings plan for salaried employees whose benefits under the qualified plan are limited by federal regulations. When an employee meets eligibility requirements, the Company matches 100% of employee contributions of up to 6% of eligible earnings for the salaried and hourly union plans. Hourly non-union employees receive an additional retirement contribution to the participant’s retirement contribution account equal to an amount which is paid and determined by the Company. Matching contributions are made in cash.

 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has stock incentive plans for directors, executives and eligible employees. Stock incentive awards include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance leveraged stock units (“PSUs”). The Company issues new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and vesting under all of its stock incentive awards. Prior to 2012, the Company also granted options to purchase shares of stock with exercise prices not less than fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. At December 31, 2020, 23,957,164 shares were authorized for future stock incentive plan awards.
Additionally, on April 18, 2019, in connection with the Newmont Goldcorp transaction, the Company exchanged certain equity settled Goldcorp share awards and Goldcorp stock options, and also assumed certain other cash-settled Goldcorp share awards.
Restricted Stock Units
The Company grants RSUs to directors, executives and eligible employees. Awards are determined as a target percentage of base salary and, for eligible employees, are subject to a personal performance factor. For all RSU grants issued prior to February 2018, RSU awards vest over periods of three years or more, unless the employee becomes retirement eligible prior to the vesting date. If an employee becomes retirement eligible and retires prior to the vesting date, the remaining awards vest on a pro rata basis at the retirement date. Starting with the February 2018 grant, if the employee becomes retirement eligible at any point during the vesting period, the entire award is considered earned after the later of the one year service period from the grant date or the retirement eligible date. Prior to vesting, holders of RSUs do not have the right to vote the underlying shares; however, directors, executives and eligible employees accrue dividend equivalents on their RSUs, which are paid at the time the RSUs vest. The accrued dividend equivalents are not paid if RSUs are forfeited. The RSUs are subject to forfeiture risk and other restrictions. Upon vesting, the employee is entitled to receive one share of the Company’s common stock for each restricted stock unit.
Performance Stock Units
The Company grants PSUs to eligible executives, based upon relative shareholder return compared to a gold company peer group. The actual number of PSUs that vest are determined at the end of a three year performance period.
Employee Stock Options
Stock options granted under the Company’s stock incentive plans vest over periods of three years or more and are exercisable over a period of time not to exceed 10 years from the grant date. The value of each option award is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. There were no options granted in 2020, 2019 or 2018. At December 31, 2019, there were 572,499 options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $57.64. During 2020, 428,286 options were exercised and 95,257 options expired with weighted average exercise prices of $57.42 and $57.77, respectively. At December 31, 2020, there were 48,956 options outstanding and exercisable, at a weighted average exercise price of $59.64, with a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.4 years.
Goldcorp Options
In connection with the Newmont Goldcorp transaction, the Company exchanged 3.6 million outstanding Goldcorp options (“Goldcorp options”) for 1.2 million Newmont options with the right to exercise each Newmont option for one share of Newmont common stock. At December 31, 2019, there were 1.1 million options outstanding and exercisable with a weighted average exercise price of $54.70. During 2020, 529,897 options were exercised with a weighted average exercise price of $50.54. No options expired in 2020. At December 31, 2020, there were 558,749 options outstanding and exercisable, at a weighted average exercise price of $58.64 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.5 years.
Stock-Based Compensation Activity
A summary of the status and activity of non-vested RSUs and PSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows:

RSU PSU
------------------------------- -------------------------------------- --------------- -------------------------------------- --------- - -----
Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value
Non-vested at beginning of year 3,068,168 $ 35.51 1,953,797 $ 44.46
Granted 1,031,837 $ 52.35 693,714 $ 58.28
Vested (1,588,319) $ 36.21 (881,656) $ 48.27
Forfeited (338,315) $ 40.50 (378,574) $ 43.69
Non-vested at end of year 2,173,371 $ 42.22 1,387,281 $ 49.16

The total intrinsic value and fair value of RSUs that vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $81, $60 and $46, respectively. The total intrinsic value and fair value of PSUs that vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $42, $71 and $68, respectively.
Cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits are classified as part of cash flows from operating activities. Excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for vested RSUs, settled PSUs, and exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock compensation costs for such equity awards. The Company recorded $1, $3 and $3 in excess tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
At December 31, 2020, there was $47 and $33 of unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested RSUs and PSUs, respectively. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2 years.
The Company recognized stock-based compensation as follows:

Years Ended December 31,
--------------------------------- ---- ---- --- -- -- --
 2020 2019 2018
Stock-based compensation:
Restricted stock units $ 51 $ 68 $ 45

Other (1) 12 24 —
 $ 84 $ 121 $ 76

____________________________(1)Other includes Goldcorp phantom restricted share units and Goldcorp performance share units. These awards have a cash settlement provision. The Company recognizes the liability and expense for these awards ratably over the requisite service period giving effect to the adjusted fair value at the end of each reporting period.

 FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING
Fair value accounting establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level 2    Quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and
Level 3    Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).
The following tables set forth the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring (at least annually) and nonrecurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy. As required by accounting guidance, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

____________________________
(1)Marketable equity securities classified as Level 2 includes warrants reported in the Maverix equity method investment balance of $14 and $13 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
(2)Debt is carried at amortized cost. The outstanding carrying value was $6,031 and $6,138 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The fair value measurement of debt was based on an independent third-party pricing source.
The fair values of the derivative instruments in the table above are presented on a net basis. The gross amounts related to the fair value of the derivative instruments above are immaterial. All other fair value disclosures in the above table are presented on a gross basis.
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (which includes restricted cash and cash equivalents) are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and are primarily money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities.
The Company’s net trade receivables from provisional metal concentrate sales, which contain an embedded derivative and are subject to final pricing, are valued using quoted market prices based on forward curves for the particular metal. As the contracts themselves are not traded on an exchange, these receivables are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s marketable and other equity securities with readily determinable fair values are valued using quoted market prices in active markets and as such are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the marketable equity securities are calculated as the quoted market price of the marketable equity security multiplied by the quantity of shares held by the Company.
The Company’s marketable and other equity securities without readily determinable fair values primarily consists of the Company’s ownership in MARA and warrants in publicly traded companies. The ownership in MARA is accounted for under the measurement alternative and is classified as a non-recurring Level 3 investment within the fair value hierarchy. Warrants are valued using a Black-Scholes model using quoted market prices in active markets of the underlying securities. As the contracts themselves are not traded on the exchange, these equity securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s restricted marketable debt securities are primarily U.S. government issued bonds and international bonds. The Company’s South American debt securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, using published market prices of actively traded securities. The Company’s North American debt securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using pricing models which are based on prices of similar, actively traded securities.
The Company’s restricted other assets primarily consist of marketable equity securities, which are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as their fair values are based on quoted market prices available in active markets.
The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration assets was determined using discounted cash flow models. The contingent consideration assets consist of financial instruments that meet the definition of a derivative, but do not qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815. These are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Increases in the discount rate will result in a decrease of the contingent consideration.
The Company’s derivative instruments consist of fixed forward contracts. These derivative instruments are valued using pricing models, and the Company generally uses similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, forward curves, measures of volatility and correlations of such inputs. The Company’s derivatives trade in liquid markets, and as such, model inputs can generally be verified and do not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
During the third quarter, the Company purchased the Holt option from Kirkland, which resulted in a downward revision to future production scenarios of the Holt mine to nil. The Company has the right to exercise the Holt option and acquire ownership to the mineral interests subject to the Holt royalty obligation in the event Kirkland intends to resume operations at the Holt mine. Kirkland has the right to assume the Company’s Holt royalty obligation at any time, in which case the Holt option would terminate. The net effect of the Holt option structure is that Kirkland cannot resume operations and process minerals subject to the Holt royalty obligation unless it also assumes the obligation. The estimated fair value of the Holt royalty obligation was determined using a discounted cash flow model. The royalty obligation is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on the Holt option.
The Company’s liability-classified stock-based compensation awards consist of cash-settled Goldcorp share awards which become payable in cash on the vesting date. These awards are valued each reporting period based on the quoted Newmont stock price. As the awards themselves are not traded on the exchange, they are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s marketable debt securities consist of an unrestricted convertible debenture with Continental (the “Continental Convertible Debt”). The estimated fair value of the host debt instrument was determined using a discounted cash flow model, with an internally derived discount rate. It has been classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Increases in the discount rate will result in a decrease of the Continental Convertible Debt. In March 2020, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Continental, which included the convertible debenture. Refer to Note 20 for further information.
The Continental conversion option is an embedded derivative in the Continental Convertible Debt agreement. It is valued using a Black-Scholes model using quoted market prices in active markets of the underlying security. As the option itself is not traded on the exchange, this instrument is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In March 2020, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Continental, which included the conversion option. Refer to Note 20 for further information.
The following tables set forth a summary of the quantitative and qualitative information related to the significant observable and unobservable inputs used in the calculation of the Company’s Level 3 financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

NOTE 32 NEVADA GOLD MINES TRANSACTIONS On July 1, 2019, Newmont and Barrick consummated the Nevada JV Agreement and established NGM, which combined the Company's Nevada mining operations with Barrick's Nevada mining operations. The formation of NGM diversifies the Company's footprint in Nevada and allows the Company to pursue additional efficiencies through integrated mine planning and processing. As of the effective date, the Company contributed its existing Nevada mining operations, which included Carlin, Phoenix, Twin Creeks and Long Canyon, to NGM in exchange for a 38.5% interest in NGM. The interest received in NGM was accounted for at fair value, and accordingly, the Company recognized a gain of $2,390 during 2019 as Gain on formation of Nevada Gold Mines. The gain represents the difference between the fair value of the Company's interest in NGM and the carrying value of the Nevada mining operations contributed to NGM. The Company accounts for its interest in NGM using the proportionate consolidation method, which is an exception available to entities in the extractive industries, thereby recognizing its pro-rata share of the assets, liabilities and operations of NGM. NGM retained an independent appraiser to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the effective date. The fair value estimates were based on income and cost valuation methods. Sales and Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders in the Consolidated Statement of Operations includes NGM revenue of $2,359 and $1,022 and NGM net income of $660 and $184 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company billed NGM $8 and $10, respectively, for services provided under the transition services agreement. In addition, the Company purchases gold from NGM for resale to third parties. Gold purchases from NGM totaled $2,293 and $1,002 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively....

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred in April and November 2020, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42 million, which represents the difference between the $55 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $126 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $45 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remain...

At our election, the Term Loan bore interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. The related issuance costs were amortized to interest expense over the Term Loan period using the effective interest method. Interest was payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elec...

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Following the move of our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into the Publishing segment, our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities as described in the "Business Overview" within Part I, Item 1, placing our Publishing and Advertising business in a third segment that contains some of our legacy products and solutions. We categorize our products into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, experience designers, app developers, enthusiasts, students, social media users and creative professionals, as well as marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate on and distribute documents and creative content. *Digital Experience--Our Digital Experience segment provides products, services and solutions for creating, managing, executing, measuring, monetizing and optimizing customer experiences from analyt...

NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information ​ 3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M's four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown. ​ Effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) has been updated for all periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments. ​ 133  3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in "Elimination of Dual Credit"). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in "Corporate and Unallocated"). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/be...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Workfront Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.50 billion in cash consideration. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and issuance of these financial statements. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 79  ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42 million, which represents the difference between the $55 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $126 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $45 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remain...

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights ("IP rights") During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits of $224 million and $1.13 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred in April and November 2020, respectively. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights will be recognized over the period of economic benefit.

Foreign currency exchange, net. Although the majority of the Company’s balances are denominated in U.S. dollars, foreign currency exchange gains (losses) are recognized on balances to be satisfied in local currencies. These balances primarily relate to the
timing of payments for employee-related benefits and other liabilities in Australia, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Suriname and Ghana.
Insurance proceeds. In 2019, the Company received insurance proceeds of $125 associated with the Musselwhite fire that occurred during March of 2019 of which $38 was recorded as business interruption losses. Of the remaining amount, $41 was recognized as an offset to the abnormal costs applicable to sales and $46 was recorded as an offset to accounts receivable. In September 2018, the Company recorded business interruption insurance proceeds of $25 associated with the East wall slips that occurred in the first half of 2018 at Kalgoorlie.

Factors that Significantly Impact Effective Tax Rate
Percentage depletion allowances (tax deductions for depletion that may exceed the tax basis in the mineral reserves) are available to the Company under the income tax laws of the United States for operations conducted in the United States or through
branches and partnerships owned by U.S. subsidiaries included in the consolidated United States income tax return. These deductions are highly sensitive to the price of gold and other minerals produced by the Company.
The Company operates in various jurisdictions around the world that have statutory tax rates that are significantly different than those of the U.S. These differences combine to move the overall effective tax rate higher than the U.S. statutory rate.
Mining taxes in Nevada, Mexico, Canada, Peru and Australia represent state and provincial taxes levied on mining operations and are classified as income taxes as such taxes are based on a percentage of mining profits.

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Following the move of our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into the Publishing segment, our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities as described in the "Business Overview" within Part I, Item 1, placing our Publishing and Advertising business in a third segment that contains some of our legacy products and solutions. We categorize our products into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, experience designers, app developers, enthusiasts, students, social media users and creative professionals, as well as marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers.
