ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains
“forward-looking
statements” that reflect our future plans, estimates,
beliefs and expected performance. We caution you that assumptions,
expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future
events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the
differences can be material. See “Risk
Factors” and “Forward-Looking
Statements.”

Overview

We are an oil and gas company focused on the
development, acquisition and production of oil and natural
gas assets where the latest in modern drilling and
completion techniques and technologies have yet to be applied. In
particular, we focus on legacy proven properties where there is a
long production history, well defined geology and existing
infrastructure that can be leveraged when applying modern field
management technologies. Our current properties are located in the
San Andres formation of the Permian Basin situated in West Texas
and eastern New Mexico and in the
Denver-Julesberg Basin in Colorado.  As of December 31, 2020,
we held approximately 37,068 net Permian Basin acres located in
Chaves and Roosevelt Counties, New Mexico, through PEDCO and
approximately 11,948 net D-J Basin acres located in Weld and Morgan
Counties, Colorado, through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary,
Red Hawk. As of December 31, 2020, we held interests in 379
gross (302 net) wells in our Permian Basin Asset of which 26
are active producers, 15 are active injectors and two are active
Saltwater Disposal Wells (“SWD”s), all of which are held by PEDCO and
operated by its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, and interests
in 77 gross (22.0 net) wells in our D-J Basin Asset, of which
18 gross (16.2 net) wells are operated by Red Hawk and
currently producing, 38 gross (5.8 net) wells are
non-operated, and 21 wells have an after-payout
interest.

Detailed
information about our business plans and operations, including our
core D-J Basin and Permian Basin Assets, is contained under
“Part
1” — “Item 1.
Business” above.

How We Conduct Our Business and Evaluate Our
Operations

Our use
of capital for acquisitions and development allows us to direct our
capital resources to what we believe to be the most attractive
opportunities as market conditions evolve. We have historically
acquired properties that we believe had significant appreciation
potential. We intend to continue to acquire both operated and
non-operated properties to the extent we believe they meet our
return objectives.

We will
use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the
performance of our oil and natural gas operations,
including:

●

production
volumes;

●

realized
prices on the sale of oil and natural gas, including the effects of
our commodity derivative contracts;

●

oil
and natural gas production and operating expenses;

●

capital
expenditures;

●

general
and administrative expenses;

●

net
cash provided by operating activities; and

●

net
income.

Reserves

Our
estimated net proved crude oil and natural gas reserves at December
31, 2020 and 2019 were approximately 14.1 MMBoe and 14.0 MMBoe,
respectively. The 0.1 MMBoe increase was primarily due to increases
in the type curve from 2019’s year-end report resulting from
historical performance and our optimization of our future
development plans to focus on areas with the highest remaining oil
in place, which was derived from technical work and studies of our
assets since their acquisition, offset by 2020 produced volumes and
minor adjustments due to commodity pricing.

Using the average monthly crude oil price of
$39.57 per Bbl and natural gas price of $1.99 per thousand cubic
feet (“Mcf”) for the twelve months ended December
31, 2020, our estimated discounted future net cash flow
(“PV-10”) before tax
expenses for our proved reserves was approximately $58.2 million,
of which approximately $36.7 million are proved undeveloped
reserves. Total reserve value at December 31, 2020, represents a
decrease of approximately $64.5 million or 53% from a year earlier
using the same SEC pricing and reserves methodology. The decrease
is strictly attributable to commodity pricing as the average
pricing for 2019 was significantly higher at $55.69 per Bbl for
crude oil and $2.58 per Mcf for natural gas.

64

The
reserves as of December 31, 2020 were determined in accordance with
standard industry practices and SEC regulations by the licensed
independent petroleum engineering firm of Cawley, Gillespie &
Associates, Inc. A large portion of the proved undeveloped crude
oil reserves are associated with the Permian Basin formation.
Although these hydrocarbon quantities have been determined in
accordance with industry standards, they are prepared using the
subjective judgments of the independent engineers and may actually
be more or less.

Oil and Natural Gas Sales Volumes

During the year ended December 31, 2020, our net
crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales volumes decreased to 252,807
Bbls or 691 Bopd from 266,070 Bbls, or 729 Bopd, a 5% decrease over
the previous fiscal year. The production decrease is primarily
related to the Company shutting-in all of its operated
producing wells in its Permian Basin Asset and D-J Basin Asset in
late April 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the
sharp decline in oil prices which occurred partially as a result of
the decreased demand for oil caused by such outbreak. In early June
2020, as prices began to partially recover, we opened up production
for 90% of our previously producing operated wells. In total, we
shut-in all our operated wells for a period of 42 days during the
months of April through June 2020.

Significant Capital Expenditures

The
table below sets out the significant components of capital
expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 (in
thousands):

Capital Expenditures
----------------------- ------
Leasehold Acquisitions $157
Drilling and Facilities 5,786
Total* $5,943

*(see “Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data” -
“Note 6 - Oil and Gas
Properties”).

Market Conditions and Commodity Prices

Our
financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of
crude oil and natural gas and our ability to market our production
on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are affected by
many factors outside of our control, including changes in market
supply and demand, which are impacted by weather conditions,
inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. As
a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and,
therefore, we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what
effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our
production volumes or revenues. In addition to production volumes
and commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of
crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical
to our long-term success. We expect prices to remain volatile for
the remainder of the year. For information about the impact of
realized commodity prices on our crude oil and natural gas and
condensate revenues, refer to “Results of Operations”
below.

Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the
results of operations for each of the two fiscal years in the years
ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements of PEDEVCO Corp. and notes
thereto included herein (see “Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data”).

We
reported a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $32.7
million, or ($0.45) per share, compared to a net loss for the
year ended December 31, 2019 of $11.1 million or ($0.22) per share.
The increase in net loss of $21.6 million was primarily due to a
$19.3 million impairment of our oil and gas properties located in
our D-J Basin Asset. Excluding this significant transaction, our
net loss increased by $2.3 million, due to a reduction in revenue
of $4.9 million, when comparing the current period to the prior
period as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the sharp decline
in oil prices which occurred partially as a result of the decreased
demand for oil caused by such outbreak, offset by a reduction of
$1.7 million in operating expenses and by $2.0 million in other
income items related to less interest on debt coupled with accounts
receivable and payable settlements.

Net Revenues

The
following table sets forth the revenue and
production data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019:

Total Revenues $8,059 $12,972 $(4,913) (38%)

(1) Assumes 6 Mcf of natural gas equivalents to 1 barrel of oil.

Total crude oil and natural gas revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $4.9 million, or 38%, to
$8.1 million, compared to $13.0 million for the same period a year
ago due primarily to an unfavorable price variance of $4.0
million, coupled with an unfavorable volume variance of $0.9
million. Although we shut-in all of our operated wells for 42 days
during the second quarter of 2020, as a result of the severe
reduction in pricing from the decreased demand in oil and
gas-related to the COVID-19 outbreak, production amounts declined
by a nominal 5% overall in the current period compared to the prior
period, primarily from five new productive wells brought online
during the latter part of the 2019 fiscal year, combined with the
four new productive wells brought online in the 2020 fiscal year in
our Permian Basin Asset, as well as our participation (non-operated
working interest) in the drilling and completion of 11 productive
wells in our D-J Basin Asset, which occurred in the latter part of
the 2019 fiscal year and which were realized in the 2020
period.

Other Income (Expense) $1,094 $(106) $1,200 (1,132%)

*Includes severance, ad valorem taxes and marketing
costs.

Lease Operating
Expenses. The decrease of $2.9 million was due to the
shut-in of all of our operated wells for 42 days during the 2020
period related to the severe reduction in pricing from the
decreased demand related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally,
direct operating lease expenses decreased relative to the overall
production increase due to the existing infrastructure and tank
batteries already in place for the recently completed wells in our
Permian Basin Asset. Additional workover activities were also down
during the 2020 period due to the economic downturn, and the
decision by management to hold off on such workover activities
until prices recovered. When comparing
periods, the Company also incurred a $0.5 million loss on the
plugging and abandonment of seven wells located in our Permian
Asset during the 2019 period. The Company also experienced
unforeseen fishing and cleanout costs, in addition to a lack of
available service providers, which resulted in additional premium
charges during the 2019 period.

Exploration
Expense.  There was a
nominal change in exploration expenses for 2020 compared to 2019,
as there was a minimal increase in exploration activity undertaken
by the Company in the current year’s period compared to the
prior year’s period.

Depreciation, Depletion,
Amortization and Accretion. The $0.3 million increase was
primarily the result of year-end reserve adjustments offset by an
overall production decrease for the current year’s period, as
noted above, when compared to the prior year’s
period.

Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, impairment of oil and gas
properties was $19,331,000, compared to $-0- for the year ended
December 31, 2019. The impairment in 2020 resulted from a reduction
of our reserve value for our D-J Basin assets relative to the
carrying amount of our D-J Basin assets, which was strictly
commodity price driven as our total reserves were 14.1 MMBoe and
14.0 MMBoe for 2020 and 2019, respectively, while our estimated discounted future net cash flow
("PV-10") before tax
expenses for our proved reserves was approximately $58.2 million
and $122.7 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing
52.5% decrease when comparing the current year to the prior
year.

67

General and Administrative
Expenses (excluding share-based compensation). The decrease
of $0.3 million in general and administrative expenses (excluding
share-based compensation) was primarily due to an $0.8 million
decrease, as well as other cost decreases, in the 2020 period,
resulting from a 20% reduction in salary for all of the
Company’s salaried employees and officers implemented on
April 1, 2020, and a reduction of non-essential contractors, offset
by $0.5 million in costs related to the terminated SandRidge
Permian Trust Offer to Exchange (see “Part 1” —
“Item 1. Business
– 2020 Material Events”).

Share-Based
Compensation. Share-based
compensation, which is included in general and administrative
expenses in the Statements of Operations, increased by $1.3
million, primarily due to an increase in the awarding of employee
share-based options and restricted shares as compensation during
the 2020 period. Share-based compensation is utilized to
conserve cash resources for use in field development activities and
operations.

Gain on Sale of Oil and Gas
Properties.  In
the 2019 period, the Company sold rights to 85.5 net acres and
acquired 121 net acres of oil and gas leases located in Weld
County, Colorado, to a third party, for aggregate proceeds of $1.2
million and recognized a gain on sale of oil and gas properties of
$1.0 million. No similar transaction occurred in the 2020
period.

Interest Expense.  The decrease of $0.8 million was
due primarily to the Company having no significant debt in the
current period, compared to 2019 year’s period. The Company
recognized $2,000 in interest related to our PPP Loan in the 2020
period.

Interest Income and Other Expense.
Includes interest earned from our interest-bearing cash accounts,
and for the 2020 period includes the settlement of accounts
payables for $0.9 million and the settlement of $0.1 million of
accounts receivable, compared to the prior period, which included
the write-off of a $0.1 million third party option related to an
option to acquire shares of Caspian Energy, which expired
unexercised.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The
primary sources of cash for the Company during the year ended
December 31, 2020, were from the sales of crude oil and natural gas
and funds provided by our entry into a PPP loan (see
“Part I - Financial
Information” - “Item 1. Financial
Statements” - “Note 7 – PPP
Loan”). The primary uses of cash were funds used for
development costs and operations. To help conserve its operating
cash, effective April 1, 2020, the Company implemented a 20%
reduction in salary for all of the Company’s salaried
employees and officers, to continue until the oil markets have
recovered to acceptable levels, which the Company has determined
has not occurred to date.

Impact of COVID-19

In
December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the
infectious disease known as COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a “Public
Health Emergency of International Concern” on January 30,
2020, and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. COVID-19 has, since
the early part of 2020, reduced worldwide economic activity. Due to
COVID-19, the Company or its employees, suppliers, and other
partners may be prevented from conducting business activities at
full capacity for an indefinite period of time, including due to
the spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns
that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities.
While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact
that COVID-19 will have on the Company’s business, the
continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the
governments of countries affected and in which the Company operates
have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the operation of the
Company’s business for a prolonged period. The COVID-19
outbreak and mitigation measures have also had an adverse impact on
global economic conditions, as well as an adverse effect on the
Company’s business and financial condition and may continue
to have an adverse effect on the Company, including on its
potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to the Company,
if at all. In addition, the Company has taken temporary
precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the
virus to its employees, vendors, and guests, including limiting the
number of occupants at the Company’s Houston headquarters and
requiring all others to work remotely, and discouraging employee
attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could
negatively affect the Company’s business. The extent to which
the COVID-19 outbreak will continue to impact the Company’s
results will depend on future developments that are highly
uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that
may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, the availability
and efficacy of vaccines, the ability of the general public to
obtain such vaccines and the willingness of individuals to be
vaccinated, and the actions to contain its impact. However, any
further decrease in the price of oil, or the demand for oil and
gas, will likely have a negative impact on our results of
operations and cash flows.

68

As discussed above, we shut-in our operated
production from mid-April through early June 2020, which directly
contributed to a decrease in production volumes from 96,515 Boe for
the three months ended March 31, 2020, to 46,530 Boe for the three
months ended June 30, 2020, representing a decrease of 52%.
Similarly, our crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs sales revenues
decreased from $2,832,000 for the three months ended March 31,
2020, to $656,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2020,
representing a decrease of 77%, largely due to our decreased
production, as well as decreases in NYMEX pricing and significantly
widened differentials, largely due to the global COVID-19 pandemic,
and the sharp decline in the demand for, and price of, oil and gas,
in connection therewith. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our
production totaled 252,807 Boe which was only a 5% decrease from
the prior period year end of 266,070 Boe. We were able to maintain
similar production numbers due to three operated wells being
completed and brought online in our Permian Basin Asset, with a
fourth well brought online in the Permian Basin Asset in the latter
part of 2020. However, due to the significant price decline
in early 2020, our sales revenues of $8,059,000 for the 2020 period
were not able to match our pre-COVID-19 fiscal year 2019 sales
revenues of $12,972,000.

In
response to the effects of COVID-19, the Company has adopted
policies, procedures, and practices both in its Houston office
headquarters and across its field operations to protect its
employees, contractors, and guests from COVID-19, including the
adoption of a COVID-19 Response Plan, implementation of contractor
questionnaires to assess COVID-19 risk and exposure prior to
entering any Company facility or worksite, adopting best practices,
guidelines and protocols recommended by the Centers for Disease
Control (the “CDC”) and the Office of
the Texas Governor for the prevention of exposure and spread of
COVID-19, and instituting weekly management calls discussing the
Company’s ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic and
effectiveness thereof. Given the Company’s robust online
systems and workflow practices and procedures, the Company has not
experienced any material challenges or reductions in efficiency or
effectiveness of its office-based workforce, while its field
personnel continues to attend to their daily field operations
uninterrupted, while mindful of social distancing and other
preventative measures and safeguards recommended by the
CDC.

Further, to help conserve its operating cash, in
April 2020 the Company initiated significant G&A cost-reduction
measures, including reducing all employee and officer salaries by
20%, until market conditions significantly improve, cutting all
discretionary spending, undertaking additional actions resulting in
a nearly 20% cash G&A reduction in the second and third
quarters of 2020, from our original G&A budget, and negotiating
reductions of approximately $1 million in vendor accounts payable.
Additionally, the Company implemented cost-reduction measures that
reduced lease operating expenses (“LOE”) by over 35% in
2020. We plan to continue to
closely monitor the global energy markets and oil and gas pricing,
with our 2021 development plan
being subject to revision, if and as necessary, to react to market
conditions in the best interest of its shareholders, while
prioritizing its financial strength and
liquidity.

Working Capital

At
December 31, 2020, the Company’s total current assets of $8.8
million exceeded its total current liabilities of $2.0 million,
resulting in a working capital surplus of $6.8 million, while at
December 31, 2019, the Company’s total current assets of
$27.1 million exceeded its total current liabilities of $15.2
million, resulting in a working capital surplus of $11.9 million.
The $5.1 million decrease in our working capital surplus is
primarily related to cash used to fund payables and accrued
expenses related to the completion of our capital drilling projects
and current operational expenses. Notwithstanding such decrease in
working capital, as discussed below, in February 2021, we raised
$8.3 million of cash pursuant to an underwritten offering of common
stock.

Financing

Other than obtaining the $370,000 PPP loan and
repayment of the Original PPP loan (see “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” - “Note 7 – PPP
Loan”), we did not engage
in any financing transactions during the year ended December 31,
2020. However, on February 5, 2021, we closed an underwritten
public offering of 5,968,500 shares of common stock at a public
offering price of $1.50 per share, which included the full exercise
of the underwriter’s over-allotment option, for net proceeds
(after deducting the underwriters’ discount equal to 6% of
the public offering price and expenses associated with the
offering) of approximately $8.3 million.

69

We expect that we will have sufficient cash
available to meet our needs over the foreseeable future, which cash
we anticipate being available from (i) projected cash flow from our
operations, (ii) existing cash on hand, (iii) equity infusions or
loans (which may be convertible) made available from SK Energy
LLC (“SK
Energy”), which is 100%
owned and controlled by Simon Kukes, our Chief Executive Officer
and director, which funding SK Energy is under no obligation to
provide, (iv) public or private debt or equity financings, and (v)
funding through credit or loan facilities. In addition, we may seek
additional funding through asset sales, farm-out arrangements, and
credit facilities to fund potential acquisitions in 2021. If market
conditions are not conducive to developing our assets consistent
with our 2021 development program, the Company may choose to delay
or extend the drilling program and associated capital expenditures
into the future. Furthermore, as a result of the COVID-19
outbreak, and the sharp decline in oil prices which occurred
partially as a result of the decreased demand for oil caused by
such outbreak and the actions taken globally to stop the spread of
such virus, in mid-April 2020, the Company shut-in all of its
operated producing wells in its Permian Basin Asset and D-J Basin
Asset to preserve the Company’s oil and gas reserves for
production during a more favorable oil price environment, with the
Company now back on full production from its operated wells in the
Permian Basin and the D-J Basin that the Company had shut-in in
mid-April 2020 due to the partial recovery of oil prices in early
June 2020. If oil prices deteriorate significantly from
current levels, the Company expects to again shut-in some or all of
its oil and gas production, which would result in reduced or no
cash flow being generated from operations during the period such
wells are shut-in, have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s projected cash flow from operations, and, once our
cash on hand is depleted, eventually require additional infusions
of capital through debt and/or equity financings, asset sales,
farm-out arrangements, lines of credit, or other means, which may
not be available on favorable terms, if at all.

Cash Flows (in thousands)

 Year Ended December 31,
--------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------
 2020 2019
Cash flows provided by operating activities $12 $1,669
Cash flows used in investing activities (14,770) (39,736)
Cash flows provided by financing activities 370 58,000
Net (decrease) increase in cash and restricted cash $(14,388) $19,933

Cash Flows provided by (used in) Operating
Activities. Net cash provided by operating
activities decreased by $1.7 million for the current year, when
compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in our net
loss of $2.3 million, which was primarily commodity price-driven,
and when not factoring in our $19.3 million impairment of our oil
and gas properties, coupled with net increases to certain of our
other components of working capital of $1.9 million, offset by net
decreases in operating activities of $2.5 million.

Cash Flows used in Investing
Activities. There was a decrease in net cash used in
investing activities of $25.0 million due to a reduction in capital
spending related to drilling and completion costs when comparing
the 2020 period to the 2019 period, mainly due to reductions and
delays in spending associated with the decline in oil prices caused
by COVID-19.

Cash Flows provided by Financing
Activities. There was $0.4 million in net cash flows
provided by obtaining PPP Loan financing in the 2020 period,
compared to $58.0 million in proceeds from financing in the 2019
period from the issuance of a related party note payable, which has
since been converted to common stock, and the sale of common
stock.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The
Company does not participate in financial transactions that
generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations is based on our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies
affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in
preparation of our financial statements.

Oil and Gas Properties, Successful Efforts
Method. The successful efforts method of accounting is
used for oil and gas exploration and production activities. Under
this method, all costs for development wells, support equipment and
facilities, and proved mineral interests in oil and gas properties
are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs are expensed when
incurred. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized as exploration
and evaluation assets pending determination of whether the wells
find proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are
the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which
geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable
certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs
under existing economic and operating conditions, (i.e., prices and
costs as of the date the estimate is made). Prices include
consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by
contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future
conditions.

Exploratory wells
in areas not requiring major capital expenditures are evaluated for
economic viability within one year of completion of drilling. The
related well costs are expensed as dry holes if it is determined
that such economic viability is not attained. Otherwise, the
related well costs are reclassified to oil and gas properties and
subject to impairment review. For exploratory wells that are found
to have economically viable reserves in areas where major capital
expenditure will be required before production can commence, the
related well costs remain capitalized only if additional drilling
is under way or firmly planned. Otherwise, the related well costs
are expensed as dry holes.

Exploration and
evaluation expenditures incurred subsequent to the acquisition of
an exploration asset in a business combination are accounted for in
accordance with the policy outlined above.

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization of capitalized oil and gas properties is
calculated on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production
method. Lease acquisition costs are amortized over the total
estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves and all other
capitalized costs are amortized over proved developed reserves.
Costs specific to developmental wells
for which drilling is in progress or uncompleted are
capitalized as wells in progress and not subject to amortization
until completion and production commences, at which time
amortization on the basis of production will begin.

Revenue
Recognition.

The
Company’s revenue is comprised entirely of revenue from
exploration and production activities. The Company’s oil is
sold primarily to marketers, gatherers, and refiners. Natural gas
is sold primarily to interstate and intrastate natural-gas
pipelines, direct end-users, industrial users, local distribution
companies, and natural-gas marketers. NGLs are sold primarily to
direct end-users, refiners, and marketers. Payment is generally
received from the customer in the month following
delivery.

Contracts with
customers have varying terms, including month-to-month contracts,
and contracts with a finite term. The Company recognizes sales
revenues for oil, natural gas, and NGLs based on the amount of each
product sold to a customer when control transfers to the customer.
Generally, control transfers at the time of delivery to the
customer at a pipeline interconnect, the tailgate of a processing
facility, or as a tanker lifting is completed. Revenue is measured
based on the contract price, which may be index-based or fixed, and
may include adjustments for market differentials and downstream
costs incurred by the customer, including gathering,
transportation, and fuel costs.

Revenues are
recognized for the sale of the Company’s net share of
production volumes. Sales on behalf of other working interest
owners and royalty interest owners are not recognized as
revenues.

Stock-Based Compensation. Pursuant
to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718,
Compensation – Stock Compensation, which establishes
accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee service,
we utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the
fair value of employee stock option awards at the date of grant,
which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including expected volatility and expected life. Changes in these
inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of
estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. These
assumptions are subjective and generally require significant
analysis and judgment to develop. When estimating fair value, some
of the assumptions will be based on, or determined from, external
data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical
experience with stock-based payment arrangements. The appropriate
weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment,
based on relevant facts and circumstances. We estimate volatility
by considering historical stock volatility. We have opted to use
the simplified method for estimating expected term, which is equal
to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual
term.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Workfront Subsequent to November 27, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Workfront, a privately held company that provides a work management platform for marketers, for approximately $1.50 billion in cash consideration. The initial purchase accounting for this transaction has not yet been completed given the short period of time between the acquisition date and issuance of these financial statements. Workfront will be integrated into our Digital Experience reportable segment for financial reporting purposes in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 79  ADOBE INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42 million, which represents the difference between the $55 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $126 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $45 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remain...
