ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS
Acquisitions
The Company regularly seeks to acquire or trade for acreage that complements its operations, provides exploration and development opportunities, increases the lateral length of future horizontal wells and provides superior returns on investment. The Company's notable recent acquisitions include:
•In May 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Double Eagle III Midco 1 LLC ("DoublePoint") in exchange for 27 million shares of Pioneer common stock and $1.0 billion of cash (the "DoublePoint Acquisition"). The Pioneer stock consideration transferred had a fair value of $4.2 billion.
•In January 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Parsley Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation that previously traded on the NYSE under the symbol "PE" ("Parsley"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 20, 2020, among Pioneer, certain of its subsidiaries, Parsley and Parsley's subsidiary, Parsley Energy, LLC (the "Parsley Acquisition"), in exchange for 52 million shares of Pioneer common stock. The Pioneer stock consideration transferred had a fair value of $6.9 billion.
Divestitures
The Company regularly reviews its asset base to identify nonstrategic assets, the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities, create organizational and operational efficiencies and further the Company's objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet to ensure financial flexibility. The Company's notable recent divestitures include:
•In February 2022, the Company completed the sale of its equity interest in a gas gathering and processing system in northern Martin County for cash proceeds of $125 million. The sale was treated as a recovery of investment from a partial sale of proved property resulting in no gain or loss being recognized.
•In December 2021, the Company completed the sale of its assets in the Delaware Basin (the "Delaware Divestiture") to Continental Resources, Inc. for cash proceeds of $3.0 billion, after normal closing adjustments. The Company's Delaware Basin assets were acquired as part of the Parsley Acquisition.
•In October 2021, the Company completed the sale of 20 thousand net acres in western Glasscock County (the "Glasscock Divestiture") to Laredo Petroleum, Inc. ("Laredo") in exchange for $137 million in cash and 960 thousand shares of Laredo's common stock representing total consideration transferred of $206 million.

Financial and Operating Performance
The Company's financial and operating performance for the year ended December 31, 2022 included the following highlights:
•Net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $7.8 billion ($31.13 per diluted share), as compared to net income of $2.1 billion ($8.61 per diluted share) for the same period in 2021. The primary components of the increase in earnings attributable to common stockholders include:
•a $4.8 billion increase in oil and gas revenues, primarily due to (i) a 35 percent increase in average realized commodity prices per BOE in 2022 due to the continued recovery in oil, NGL and gas demand, low worldwide inventory levels, OPEC supplies being below agreed quotas and the impact to global oil and gas supplies resulting from sanctions against Russia related to their invasion of Ukraine and (ii) a five percent increase in daily sales volumes due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program and a full year of production from the assets acquired in the DoublePoint Acquisition in May 2021, partially offset by reduced production associated with the assets divested as part of the Delaware Divestiture in December 2021;
•a $1.9 billion decrease in derivative losses, primarily due to a reduction in the Company's commodity derivative positions in 2022; and
•a $1.2 billion change in net gain/loss on disposition of assets, primarily due to the Delaware Divestiture in December 2021;
partially offset by:
•a $1.5 billion increase in income taxes, primarily due to the increase in earnings in 2022 compared to 2021; and
•a $1.0 billion increase in production costs, including taxes, primarily attributable to increases in (i) production taxes, ad valorem taxes and gathering, processing and transportation costs that are directly related to the

increase in commodity prices, (ii) lease operating expenses primarily due to inflationary pressures on power, fuel and labor costs, (iii) workover activity and (iv) a full year of production costs added from the assets acquired in the DoublePoint Acquisition in May 2021, partially offset by a decrease in production costs as a result of the Delaware Divestiture.
•During the year ended December 31, 2022, average daily sales volumes increased on a BOE basis by five percent to 649,773 BOEPD, as compared to 617,332 BOEPD during the same period in 2021.
•Average oil and NGL prices per Bbl and average gas prices per Mcf increased to $95.66, $37.67 and $6.03, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $67.60, $32.70 and $3.85, respectively, for the same period in 2021.
•Net cash provided by operating activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2022 to $11.3 billion, as compared to $6.0 billion for the same period in 2021. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to (i) the aforementioned increases in oil and gas revenues and daily sales volumes (ii) a decrease in cash used in derivative activities, partially offset by (i) an increase in income taxes, (ii) an increase in production costs, including production and ad valorem taxes and (iii) a reduction in cash flow associated with the assets divested as part of the Delaware Divestiture.
•During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid base dividends of $1.1 billion, or $4.38 per share, and variable dividends of $5.2 billion, or $21.68 per share, as compared to base dividends of $487 million, or $2.23 per share, and variable dividends of $1.1 billion, or $4.53 per share for the same period in 2021.
•During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 7.2 million shares for $1.6 billion under the Company's stock repurchase program, as compared to repurchases of 1.4 million shares for $250 million during the same period in 2021.
•As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company's net debt to book capitalization was 15 percent and 12 percent, respectively.

Oil and Gas Industry Considerations
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a severe worldwide economic downturn, significantly disrupting the demand for oil throughout the world, and created significant volatility, uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry. The decrease in demand for oil, combined with excess supply of oil and related products, resulted in oil prices declining significantly beginning in late February 2020. Since mid-2020, oil prices have improved, with demand steadily increasing despite the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 variants, and related responses by governments worldwide with regards to travel restrictions, business closures and other restrictions, which have continued to inhibit a full global demand recovery. In addition, worldwide oil inventories, from a historical perspective, remain low and concerns exist with the ability of OPEC and other oil producing nations to meet forecasted future oil demand growth, with many OPEC countries not able to produce at their OPEC agreed upon quota levels due to their limited capital investments directed towards developing incremental oil supplies over the past few years. Furthermore, sanctions, import bans and price caps on Russia have been implemented by various countries in response to the war in Ukraine, further impacting global oil supply. As a result of these and other oil and gas supply constraints, the world has experienced significant increases in energy costs. During December 2022, OPEC announced a continuation of its 2 MMBOPD production cut that started in November 2022 related to the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and future oil demand. As a result of the current global supply and demand imbalances, oil and gas prices have remained strong with average NYMEX oil and NYMEX gas prices for the three months ended December 31, 2022 being $82.64 per Bbl and $6.26 per Mcf, respectively, as compared to $77.19 per Bbl and $5.84 per Mcf, respectively, for the same period in 2021. In addition, the ongoing pandemic, combined with the Russia/Ukraine conflict, has resulted in global supply chain disruptions, which has led to significant cost inflation and the potential for a global recession. Specifically, the Company's 2022 capital program was impacted by higher than expected inflation in steel, diesel and chemical prices, among other items.
Global oil price levels and inflationary pressures will ultimately depend on various factors that are beyond the Company's control, such as (i) the ability of OPEC and other oil producing nations to manage the global oil supply, (ii) the impact of sanctions and import bans on production from Russia, (iii) the timing and supply impact of any Iranian sanction relief on their ability to export oil, (iv) the effectiveness of responses by businesses and governments to combat any additional outbreaks of the COVID-19 virus and their impact on domestic and worldwide demand, (v) the global supply chain constraints associated with manufacturing and distribution delays, (vi) oilfield service demand and cost inflation, (vii) political stability of oil consuming countries and (viii) increasing expectations that the world may be heading into a global recession. The Company continues to assess and monitor the impact of these factors and consequences on the Company and its operations.

First Quarter 2023 Outlook
Based on current estimates, the Company expects the following operating and financial results for the first quarter of 2023:

--------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------
 Three Months Ending March 31, 2023
 Guidance
 ($ in millions, except per BOE amounts)
Average daily production (MBOE) 659 - 687
Average daily oil production (MBbls) 349 - 364
Production costs per BOE $11.75 - $13.25
DD&A per BOE $10.50 - $12.00
Exploration and abandonments expense $10 - $20
General and administrative expense $78 - $88
Interest expense $27 - $32
Other expense $20 - $40
Cash flow impact from firm transportation (a) $(50) - $(90)
Cash income taxes $70 - $100
Effective tax rate 22% - 27%

_____________________
(a)The cash flow impact from firm transportation is primarily based on (i) the forecasted differential between Midland WTI oil prices and Brent oil prices less the costs to transport purchased oil from the areas of the Company's production to the Gulf Coast and (ii) oil price fluctuations between the time the Company purchases the oil from its areas of operation and when the oil is delivered and sold to Gulf Coast refineries or exported to international markets. To the extent that the Company's Gulf Coast sales of purchased oil does not cover the purchase price and associated firm transport costs, the Company's results of operations will reflect the negative cash flow impact attributable to the shortfall.

2023 Capital Budget
The Company's capital budget for 2023 is expected to be in the range of (i) $4.45 billion to $4.75 billion of development related capital, which includes drilling and completion related activities, and the construction of tank batteries, saltwater disposal facilities and water infrastructure, and (ii) $150 million to $200 million of exploration, environmental and other capital, principally related to drilling four Barnett/Woodford formation wells in the Midland Basin, additional testing of the Company's enhanced oil recovery ("EOR") project and adding electric power infrastructure for future drilling, completions and production operations. The 2023 capital budget excludes acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest, geological and geophysical general and administrative expense, corporate facilities and vehicles.
The 2023 capital budget is expected to be funded from operating cash flow and, if necessary, from cash and cash equivalents on hand or borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility.

Results of Operations
Results of operations should be read together with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a discussion of the Company's 2021 results of operations as compared to the Company's 2020 results of operations.
Oil and gas revenues. The Company's oil and gas revenues are derived from sales of oil, NGL and gas production. Increases or decreases in the Company's revenues, profitability and future production are highly dependent on commodity prices. Prices are market driven and future prices will fluctuate due to supply and demand factors, availability of transportation, seasonality, geopolitical developments and economic factors, among other items.

Total (BOE) 649,773 617,332 5 %

____________________
(a)Gas production excludes gas produced and used as field fuel.
Average daily BOE sales volumes increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program and a full year of production from the assets acquired in the DoublePoint Acquisition in May 2021, partially offset by reduced production of 47 MBOE per day associated with the assets divested as part of the Company's Delaware Divestiture in December 2021, which had a higher percentage of oil production than the Company's Midland Basin assets.
The oil, NGL and gas prices reported by the Company are based on the market prices received for each commodity. Commodity prices for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, increased due to the continued recovery in oil, NGL and gas demand, low worldwide inventory levels, OPEC supplies being below agreed quotas and the impact to global oil and gas supplies resulting from sanctions against Russia related to their invasion of Ukraine. The average prices are as follows:

----------------- ----------------------- ---- ----- ---- -------- ----- -- -
 Year Ended December 31,
 2022 2021 % Change
Oil price per Bbl $ 95.66 $ 67.60 42 %
NGL price per Bbl $ 37.67 $ 32.70 15 %
Gas price per Mcf $ 6.03 $ 3.85 57 %
Price per BOE $ 68.77 $ 51.05 35 %

Net sales of purchased commodities. The Company enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure available oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company's areas of production and to secure diesel supply from the Gulf Coast. The Company also enters into purchase commitments to secure sand supply for the Company's operations in the Midland Basin. The Company enters into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to diversify a portion of the Company's oil and gas sales to (i) Gulf Coast refineries, (ii) Gulf Coast and West Coast gas markets and (iii) international oil markets, and to satisfy unused gas pipeline capacity commitments. The Company periodically sells diesel and sand to unaffiliated third parties in the Permian Basin if it has supply in excess of its operational needs. Revenues and expenses from these transactions are generally presented on a gross basis in sales of purchased commodities and purchased commodities expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as the Company acts as a principal in the transaction by assuming both the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, of the commodities purchased and the responsibility to deliver the commodities sold. In conjunction with the Company's downstream sales, the Company also enters into pipeline capacity and storage commitments in order to secure available oil and gas transportation capacity from the Company's areas of production to downstream sales points and storage capacity at downstream sales points. The transportation and storage costs associated with these transactions are included in purchased commodities expense.
The net effect of third party purchases and sales of commodities is as follows:

------------------------------ ----------------------- ------------- ----- ---- ----- ------ ----- ----- - -----
 Year Ended December 31,
 2022 2021 Change

Sales of purchased commodities $ 8,074 $ 6,367 $ 1,707
Purchased commodities expense 8,235 6,560 1,675
 $ (161) $ (193) $ 32

The change in net sales of purchased commodities for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to improved margins on the Company's downstream Gulf Coast refinery and export oil sales.

_____________________
(a)The year ended December 31, 2021 includes $521 million of losses attributable to the early settlement of certain 2022 oil and gas commodity derivatives primarily related to (i) the termination of certain of its 2022 oil and gas commodity derivative positions and (ii) entering into equal and offsetting oil and gas commodity derivative trades, which had the net effect of eliminating future fair value changes to certain of its 2022 derivative positions.
Commodity price derivatives. The Company primarily utilizes derivative contracts to reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells. The oil and gas price impact related to the Company's commodity price derivatives are as follows:

(a)Excludes the effect from early settlement of certain of the Company's oil derivative contracts, resulting in cash payments of $316 million and $192 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
(b)Excludes the effect from early settlement of certain of the Company's gas derivative contracts, resulting in cash payments of $12 million and $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Marketing derivatives. The Company uses marketing derivatives to diversify its oil pricing to Gulf Coast and international markets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's marketing derivatives reflect long-term marketing contracts whereby the Company agreed to purchase and simultaneously sell barrels of oil at an oil terminal in Midland, Texas.
In October 2019, the Company agreed to purchase and simultaneously sell 50 thousand barrels of oil per day beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2026.
In April 2022, the Company agreed to purchase and simultaneously sell (i) 40 thousand barrels of oil per day beginning May 1, 2022 and ending April 30, 2027 and (ii) 30 thousand barrels of oil per day beginning August 1, 2022 and ending July 31, 2027.
The price the Company pays to purchase the oil volumes under the purchase contract is based on a Midland WTI price and the price the Company receives for the oil volumes sold is the WASP that a non-affiliated counterparty receives for selling oil through a Gulf Coast storage and export facility at prices that are highly correlated with Brent oil prices during the same month of the purchase. Based on the form of the long-term marketing contracts, the Company accounts for the contracts as derivative instruments not designated as hedges.
Conversion option derivatives. In May 2020, the Company issued $1.3 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2025 (the "Convertible Notes"). Certain holders of the Convertible Notes exercised their conversion option during the year ended December 31, 2022. Per the terms of the notes indenture, the Company elected to settle the conversions in cash, with settlement occurring 25 trading days from the notice of conversion (the "Settlement Period"). The Company's election to settle an exercised conversion option in cash results in a forward contract during the Settlement Period that is accounted for as a derivative instrument not designated as a hedge. The Company's conversion option derivatives represent the change in the cash settlement obligation that occurs during the Settlement Period related to conversion options exercised by certain holders of the Company's Convertible Notes.
The Company's open derivative contracts are subject to market risk. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Note 4 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.

Gain (loss) on disposition of assets, net $ 106 $ (1,067) $ 1,173

The net gain on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to the Company's divestment of certain undeveloped acres and producing wells in the Midland Basin for cash proceeds of $164 million, resulting in a gain on the sales of $110 million.
The net loss on disposition of assets for the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily due to the completion of the Delaware Divestiture, resulting in the Company recording a loss of $1.1 billion.
See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.

Net natural gas plant income (c) (1.04) (0.93) 12 %
 $ 8.09 $ 5.63 44 %

____________________
(a)Lease operating expense and workover costs represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control.
(b)Gathering, processing and transportation expense represents the costs to (i) gather, process, transport and fractionate the Company's gas and NGLs to a point of sale and, to a lesser extent, (ii) gather and transport certain of the Company's oil production to a point of sale.
(c)Net natural gas plant income represents the earnings from the Company's ownership share of gas processing facilities that gather and process the Company's and third party gas.
The change in the Company's production costs per BOE during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is due to the following:
•Lease operating expense per BOE increased primarily due to inflationary pressures on power, fuel and labor costs;
•Gathering, processing and transportation expense per BOE increased primarily due to increased gas processing costs as a result of (i) an increase in gas and NGL prices attributable to the contractual volumes retained by the processor as payment for their services and (ii) an increase in gas processing plant electricity costs, which the processor passes through to each gas producer;
•Workover costs per BOE increased due to an increase in workover activity as a result of improved commodity prices being realized in 2022, which increased the economic benefit of repairing certain of the Company's oil and gas wells; and
•Net natural gas plant income per BOE increased primarily due to improved gas and NGL prices, partially offset by the loss of net natural gas plant income associated with the Company's Martin County Gas Processing Divestiture in February 2022.

Ad valorem taxes per BOE 0.81 0.48 69 %
 $ 4.08 $ 2.89 41 %

In general, production taxes and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, Texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices.
The change in production taxes per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is due to the aforementioned increase in oil, NGL and gas commodity prices. The change in ad valorem taxes per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to an increase in prior year commodity prices that are used to determine current year ad valorem taxes.

The change in cash general and administrative expense per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to (i) $20 million of charitable contributions to various Ukraine humanitarian aid organizations in response to the Russia/Ukraine conflict and (ii) incremental general and administrative costs associated with an increase in headcount due to the Parsley Acquisition and DoublePoint Acquisition. The change in noncash general and administrative expense per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to changes in the market value of investments underlying the Company's deferred compensation obligation.

The change in income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to an increase of $7.2 billion in income before income taxes. The Company's effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent in 2021 primarily due to state income taxes. The Company settled certain state unrecognized tax benefits during the year ended December 31, 2022 resulting in lower 2022 state income taxes.

Based on the Company's earnings, the Company's available tax attributes were not sufficient to offset taxable U.S. federal income in 2022. As a result, the Company made U.S. net federal cash tax payments totaling $424 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Additionally, the Company made state cash tax payments totaling $21 million during the same period. Cash taxes were paid from operating cash flows and cash on hand.
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which includes, among other things, the CAMT. Under the CAMT, a 15 percent minimum tax will be imposed on certain adjusted financial statement income of "applicable corporations," which is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The CAMT generally treats a corporation as an "applicable corporation" in any taxable year in which the "average annual adjusted financial statement income" of the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates for a three-taxable-year period ending prior to such taxable year exceeds $1 billion. The IRA also establishes a one percent excise tax on stock repurchases made by publicly traded U.S. corporations, effective for stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. The IRA did not impact the Company's current year tax provision or the Company's consolidated financial statements, but the new provisions could impact future periods.
See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity. The Company's primary sources of short-term liquidity are (i) cash and cash equivalents, (ii) net cash provided by operating activities, (iii) sales of investments, (iv) unused borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, (v) issuances of debt or equity securities and (vi) other sources, such as sales of nonstrategic assets.
The Company's short-term and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of (i) capital expenditures, (ii) acquisitions of oil and gas properties, (iii) payments of contractual obligations, including debt maturities, (iv) dividends and share repurchases, (v) income taxes and (vi) working capital obligations. Funding for these requirements may be provided by any combination of the Company's sources of liquidity. Although the Company expects that its sources of funding will be adequate to fund its 2023 liquidity requirements, no assurance can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Company's future needs.
2023 capital budget. The Company's capital budget for 2023 is expected to be in the range of (i) $4.45 billion to $4.75 billion of development related capital, which includes drilling and completion related activities, and the construction of tank batteries, saltwater disposal facilities and water infrastructure, and (ii) $150 million to $200 million of exploration, environmental and other capital, principally related to drilling four Barnett/Woodford formation wells in the Midland Basin, additional testing of the Company's EOR project and adding electric power infrastructure for future drilling, completions and production operations. The 2023 capital budget excludes acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest, geological and geophysical general and administrative expense, corporate facilities and vehicles.
The 2023 capital budget is expected to be funded from operating cash flow and, if necessary, from cash and cash equivalents on hand or borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility.
Capital resources. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its Credit Facility, leaving $2.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity. The Credit Facility requires the maintenance of a ratio of total debt to book capitalization, subject to certain adjustments, not to exceed 0.65 to 1.0. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of December 31, 2022. The Company also had unrestricted cash on hand of $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2022.
Sources and uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, are as follows:

----------------------------------------- ----------------------- -------- ---- ------ ------- - -----
 Year Ended December 31,
 2022 2021 Change
 (in millions)
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,348 $ 6,046 $ 5,302
Net cash used in investing activities $ (3,586) $ (856) $ 2,730
Net cash used in financing activities $ (10,614) $ (2,807) $ 7,807

Operating activities. The change in net cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to (i) an increase in oil and gas revenues as a result of higher commodity prices and sales volumes attributable to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program and a full year of sales volumes from the DoublePoint Acquisition and (ii) a decrease in cash used in derivative activities, partially offset by (i) an increase in income taxes, (ii) an increase in production costs, including production and ad valorem

Financing activities. The Company's significant financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:
•2022: The Company (i) paid dividends of $6.3 billion, (ii) paid $1.5 billion to redeem $1.4 billion of its outstanding 0.750% senior notes due 2024, 4.450% senior notes due 2026 and 5.625% senior notes due 2027, having aggregate principal amounts of $750 million, $500 million and $179 million, respectively, (iii) repurchased $1.7 billion of its common stock, (iv) paid $857 million to settle exercised conversion options related to the Company's Convertible Notes, (v) repaid $244 million associated with the maturity of its 3.950% senior notes due in July 2022, (vi) paid $192 million of other liabilities and (vii) received $103 million in proceeds of privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institution counterparties (the "Capped Call") related to the aforementioned exercised conversion options.
•2021: The Company (i) received proceeds from the May 2021 issuance of 0.550% senior notes due May 2023 ("May 2021 Senior Notes Offering"), net of $4 million of issuance costs and discounts, of $746 million, (ii) received proceeds from the January 2021 issuance of 0.750% senior callable notes due January 2024, 1.125% senior notes due January 2026 and 2.150% senior notes due January 2031 ("January 2021 Senior Notes Offering"), net of $24 million of issuance costs and discounts, of $2.5 billion, (iii) borrowed and repaid $650 million on the Company's Credit Facility, (iv) repaid the Parsley and DoublePoint credit facilities, which had outstanding balances of $397 million and $240 million, respectively, (v) repaid $140 million associated with the maturity of its 3.450% senior notes due in January 2021, (vi) used proceeds from the May 2021 Senior Notes Offering to pay $731 million to redeem DoublePoint's 7.750% senior notes due 2025, (vii) used proceeds from the January 2021 Senior Notes Offering to pay $1.6 billion to redeem Parsley's 5.250% senior notes due 2025, Parsley's 5.375% senior notes due 2025 and Jagged Peak's 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (assumed by Parsley in a prior acquisition), (viii) paid $852 million to purchase a portion of Parsley's 5.625% senior notes due 2027 and Parsley's 4.125% senior notes due 2028 pursuant to a cash tender offer, (ix) paid dividends of $1.6 billion, (x) repurchased $269 million of its common stock and (xi) paid $164 million of other liabilities.
Dividends/distributions. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid base dividends of $1.1 billion, or $4.38 per common share, compared to $487 million, or $2.23 per common share, during the year ended December 31, 2021.
In addition to its base dividend program, the Company has a variable dividend strategy whereby the Company pays a quarterly variable dividend of up to 75 percent of the prior quarter's free cash flow remaining after its base dividend. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. As used by the Company, free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for changes in operating assets and liabilities, less capital expenditures. The Company believes this non-GAAP measure is a financial indicator of the Company's ability to internally fund acquisitions, debt maturities, dividends and share repurchases after capital expenditures. Capital expenditures exclude acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest, geological and geophysical general and administrative expenses, information technology capital investments and additions to corporate facilities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid variable dividends of $5.2 billion, or $21.68 per common share, compared to $1.1 billion, or $4.53 per common share, during the year ended December 31, 2021.
On February 22, 2023, the Board declared a quarterly base dividend of $1.10 per share and a quarterly variable dividend of $4.48 per share for shareholders of record on March 6, 2023, with a payment date of March 17, 2023. Future base and variable dividends are at the discretion of the Board, and, if declared, the Board may change the dividend amount based on the Company's outlook for commodity prices, liquidity, debt levels, capital resources, free cash flow or other factors. The Company can provide no assurance that dividends will be authorized or declared in the future or as to the amount of any future dividends.

PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
Any future variable dividends, if declared and paid, will fluctuate based on the Company's free cash flow, which will depend on a number of factors beyond the Company's control, including commodity prices.
Off-balance sheet arrangements. From time to time, the Company enters into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2022, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company had entered into included (i) firm purchase, transportation, storage and fractionation commitments, (ii) open purchase commitments and (iii) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable. The contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable include (a) derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices or the Company's share price, (b) gathering, processing and transportation commitments on uncertain volumes of future throughput and (c) indemnification obligations following certain divestitures.
In connection with its divestiture transactions, the Company may retain certain liabilities and provide the purchaser certain indemnifications, subject to defined limitations, which may apply to identified pre-closing matters, including matters of litigation, environmental contingencies, royalties and income taxes. Also associated with its divestiture transactions, the Company has issued and received guarantees to facilitate the transfer of contractual obligations, such as firm transportation agreements or gathering and processing arrangements. The Company does not recognize a liability if the fair value of the obligation is immaterial or the likelihood of making payments under these guarantees is remote.
Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. The Company expects to enter into similar contractual arrangements in the future and additional firm purchase, transportation, storage and fractionation arrangements, in order to support the Company's business plans. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Convertible senior notes. In May 2020, the Company issued $1.3 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2025. The Convertible Notes bear a fixed interest rate of 0.250% per year, with interest payable on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The Convertible Notes will mature on May 15, 2025, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. The Convertible Notes are unsecured obligations ranking equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company.
The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at an adjusted conversion rate of 10.2823 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes (subject to further adjustment pursuant to the terms of the notes indenture, the "Conversion Rate"), which represents an adjusted conversion price of $97.25 per share (subject to further adjustment pursuant to the terms of the notes indenture, the "Conversion Price") as of December 31, 2022. As a result of the quarterly base and variable dividends declared through December 31, 2022, the Conversion Rate increased from the initial rate of 9.1098 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes and the Conversion Price decreased from $109.77. Future declarations of quarterly base and variable dividends in excess of $0.55 per common share will cause further adjustments to the Conversion Rate and the Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of the notes indenture. Upon conversion, the Convertible Notes may be settled in cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination thereof, at the Company's election.
Holders of the Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option prior to February 15, 2025 under the following circumstances:
•during the quarter following any quarter during which the last reported sales price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of such quarter exceeds 130 percent of the Conversion Price;
•during the five-day period following any five consecutive trading day period when the trading price of the Convertible Notes is less than 98 percent of the product of the last reported sales price of the Company's common stock and the Conversion Rate;
•upon notice of redemption by the Company; or
•upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, including certain consolidations or mergers.
On or after February 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time. The Company may not redeem the Convertible Notes prior to May 20, 2023, and after such date, may redeem the Convertible Notes only if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock has been at least 130 percent of the Conversion Price for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides the notice of redemption. The redemption price is equal to 100 percent of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
During the last 30 consecutive trading days of the fourth quarter of 2022, the last reported sales prices of the Company's common stock exceeded 130 percent of the Conversion Price for at least 20 trading days, causing the Convertible Notes to become convertible at the option of the holders during the three month period ending March 31, 2023. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, certain holders of the Convertible Notes exercised their conversion option resulting in the Company redeeming $361 million of the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes for total cash payments of $857 million. The Company reserves its right under the notes indenture to elect to settle the Convertible Notes in cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and common stock. See Note 7 and Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Contractual obligations. The Company's contractual obligations include long-term debt, leases (primarily related to contracted drilling rigs, office facilities and other equipment), capital funding obligations, derivative obligations, firm transportation, storage and fractionation commitments, minimum annual gathering, processing and transportation commitments and other liabilities. Other joint owners in the properties operated by the Company could incur portions of the costs represented by these commitments.
Firm commitments. The Company has short-term and long-term firm purchase, gathering, processing, transportation, fractionation and storage commitments representing take-or-pay agreements, which include contractual commitments (i) to purchase sand, water and diesel for use in the Company's drilling and completion operations, (ii) with midstream service companies and pipeline carriers for future gathering, processing, transportation, fractionation and storage and (iii) with oilfield services companies that provide drilling and pressure pumping services. The Company does not expect to be able to fulfill all of its short-term and long-term firm transportation volume obligations from projected production of available reserves; consequently, the Company plans to purchase third party volumes to satisfy its firm transportation commitments if it is economic to do so; otherwise, it will pay demand fees for any commitment shortfalls. The Company also has open purchase commitments for inventories, materials and other property and equipment ordered, but not received, as of December 31, 2022. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Long-term debt. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's outstanding debt is comprised of senior notes, including senior notes issued by Parsley, and convertible senior notes. The senior notes and convertible senior notes issued by the Company rank equally, but are structurally subordinated to all obligations of the Company's subsidiaries. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Operating leases. The Company's short-term and long-term lease obligations primarily relate to contracted drilling rigs, storage tanks, equipment and office facilities. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Derivative obligations. The Company's commodity, marketing and conversion option derivatives are periodically measured and recorded at fair value and continue to be subject to market and/or credit risk. As of December 31, 2022, these contracts represented net liabilities of $139 million. The ultimate liquidation value of the Company's commodity and marketing derivatives will be dependent upon actual future commodity prices, which may differ materially from the inputs used to determine the derivatives' fair values as of December 31, 2022. The ultimate liquidation of the Company's conversion option derivatives will be dependent on the Company's daily volumetric weighted average share price during the Settlement Period. See Note 4 and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information.
Other liabilities. The Company's other liabilities represent current and noncurrent other liabilities that are primarily comprised of litigation and environmental contingencies, asset retirement obligations, a finance lease for the corporate headquarters office building, deferred compensation retirement plan obligations and other obligations for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance. See Note 9 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Book capitalization and current ratio. The Company's net book capitalization as of December 31, 2022 was $26.4 billion, consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion, debt of $4.9 billion and equity of $22.5 billion. The Company's net debt to book capitalization increased to 15 percent as of December 31, 2022 from 12 percent as of December 31, 2021. The Company's ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.96:1 as of December 31, 2022, as compared to 1.52:1 as of December 31, 2021.
Debt ratings. The Company is rated as investment grade by three credit rating agencies. The Company's credit ratings are subject to regular reviews by the credit rating agencies. The Company believes that each of the rating agencies considers

60

Table of Contents
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
many factors in determining the Company's ratings, including: (i) production growth opportunities, (ii) liquidity, (iii) debt levels, (iv) asset composition and (v) proved reserve mix. A reduction in the Company's debt ratings could increase the interest rates that the Company incurs on Credit Facility borrowings and could negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this Report in accordance with GAAP. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information. The following is a discussion of the Company's most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the Company's application of GAAP.
Successful efforts method of accounting. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. In general, the Company believes that net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method, particularly during periods of active exploration. The critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is that under the successful efforts method, exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting, such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense.
Proved reserve estimates. Estimates of the Company's proved reserves included in this Report are prepared in accordance with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a proved reserve estimate is a function of:
•the quality and quantity of available data;
•the interpretation of that data;
•the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and
•the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.
The Company's proved reserve information included in this Report as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was prepared by the Company's engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Company's major properties. Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, proved reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify, positively or negatively, material revisions to the estimate of proved reserves.
It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this Report as of December 31, 2022 is the current market value of the Company's estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the 2022 Standardized Measure on a twelve month average of commodity prices on the first day of each month in 2022 and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See "Item 2. Properties" and Unaudited Supplementary Information included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
The Company's estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the Company records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower commodity prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the Company's assessment of its proved properties and goodwill for impairment.
Suspended wells. The Company suspends the costs of exploratory/extension wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final determination of the commercial potential of the discovery. The ultimate disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity and development decisions. If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal activities or development of these fields, the costs of these wells will be charged to exploration and abandonments expense.
The Company does not carry the costs of drilling an exploratory/extension well as an asset in its consolidated balance sheets following the completion of drilling unless both of the following conditions are met:
•the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well; and
•the Company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.

Table of Contents
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of certain projects, it may take an extended period of time to evaluate the future potential of an exploration project and the economics associated with making a determination on its commercial viability. In these instances, the project's feasibility is not contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Company's ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies' production data in the area, transportation or processing facilities and/or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly. Consequently, the Company's assessment of suspended exploratory/extension well costs is continuous until a decision can be made that the project has found sufficient proved reserves to sanction the project or is determined to be noncommercial and is charged to exploration and abandonments expense. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Deferred tax asset valuation allowances. The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company-specific, oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and based on that information, along with other data, reassesses the likelihood that the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions will be utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period.
Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can materially vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons. The ultimate cost of litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages that may become payable. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations, developing information relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. A liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Valuation of other assets and liabilities at fair value. The Company periodically measures and records certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The assets and liabilities that the Company measures and records at fair value on a recurring basis include equity investments, deferred compensation plan assets, commodity derivative contracts, marketing derivative contracts, conversion option derivatives and interest rate contracts. Other assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. The assets and liabilities that the Company measures and records at fair value on a nonrecurring basis can include inventories, proved and unproved oil and gas properties, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, goodwill and other long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are determined to be impaired or held for sale. The Company also measures and discloses certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, such as long-term debt. The valuation methods used by the Company to measure the fair values of these assets and liabilities may require considerable management judgment and estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value estimates, such as future prices, credit-adjusted risk-free rates and current volatility factors.

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 2, 2022, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services: ------------- -------------------- ----- (in millions) Fiscal Year Purchase Obligations 2023 $ 1,632 2024 921 2025 775 2026 753 2027 783 Thereafter 1,226 Total $ 6,090 Royalties We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

(6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. The 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...

("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions.

Note 9. Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements mostly for certain of our offices, data centers, colocations, and land. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements mostly for certain network infrastructure. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2023 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The components of lease costs are as follows (in millions): ----------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - ----- Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 380 $ 344 $ 259 Interest 16 15 14 Operating lease cost 1,857 1,540 1,391 Variable lease cost and other, net 363 272 269 Total lease cost $ 2,616 $ 2,171 $ 1,933 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded $1.71 billion impairment loss for operating lease ROU assets as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts.

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis.

For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...

The change in geological and geophysical costs for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, is primarily due to the one-time relicensing of certain Parsley seismic data in connection with the Parsley Acquisition during 2021.
Leasehold abandonment costs primarily represent the abandonment of certain unproved properties that the Company no longer plans to drill before the leases expire.
During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company drilled and evaluated 442 and 488 exploratory/extension wells, respectively, with 100 percent successfully completed as discoveries.

NOTE 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for Aldrich and Murray and environmental and product liability matters. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. Asbestos-Related Matters Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies of the Company have been named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims were filed against predecessors of Aldrich and Murray and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by predecessors of Aldrich or Murray, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of the Company's existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. On June 18, 2020, Aldrich and Murray filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants and to Aldrich and Murray. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to th...

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content.

['s net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions will be utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period.
Litigation and environmental contingencies. The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can materially vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons. The ultimate cost of litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages that may become payable. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations, developing information relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. A liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable.

Valuation of other assets and liabilities at fair value. The Company periodically measures and records certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The assets and liabilities that the Company measures and records at fair value on a recurring basis include equity investments, deferred compensation plan assets, commodity derivative contracts, marketing derivative contracts, conversion option derivatives and interest rate contracts. Other assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. The assets and liabilities that the Company measures and records at fair value on a nonrecurring basis can include inventories, proved and unproved oil and gas properties, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, goodwill and other long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are determined to be impaired or held for sale. The Company also measures and discloses certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, such as long-term debt. The valuation methods used by the Company to measure the fair values of these assets and liabilities may require considerable management judgment and estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value estimates, such as future prices, credit-adjusted risk-free rates and current volatility factors.
