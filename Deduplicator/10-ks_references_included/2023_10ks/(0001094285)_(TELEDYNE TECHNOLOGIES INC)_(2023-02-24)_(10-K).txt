Table of Contents

We may not be able to sell or reconfigure businesses, facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated.
Consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets, we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy and objectives. Over the years we have also consolidated some of our business units and facilities, in some cases to respond to downturns in the defense or oil and gas industries, among other reasons. We may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from our consolidation activities. There is no assurance that our efforts will be successful. If we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities, or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Our ability to dispose of, exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors, including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement or lease agreement, as well as industry, business and economic conditions. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell non-strategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, if the sale of any non-strategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical, alternative courses of action, including relocation of product lines or closure, may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated.
Risks related to climate change
Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.
Climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customers, partners and suppliers. While we seek to mitigate the risks associated with climate change on our operations, there are inherent climate-related risks globally. As discussed under the risk factor below headed “Natural and man-made disasters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition,” some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions that may be impacted by severe weather events, like hurricanes or ice storms, or in areas prone to wildfires, droughts and rising sea levels, the frequency and severity of which may increase as a result of climate change. These events could result in potential damage to our physical assets as well as disruptions in manufacturing activities. Severe weather and wildfire events may impair the ability of our employees to work effectively. Climate change, including the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its potential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our suppliers do business, may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience higher employee attrition and higher costs to maintain or resume operations. The effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks, which could similarly increase our operating and material costs. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them.
We sell products to customers directly engaged in oil and gas exploration and production. Changes to regulations, social practices and preferences, energy generation and transportation technologies that may occur or be implemented to mitigate climate change could result in reduced demand for hydrocarbon products, which could result in a reduction in sales to these customers.
Regulations associated with climate change could adversely affect our business.
Legislative and regulatory measures currently under consideration or being implemented by government authorities to address climate change could require reductions in our GHG or other emissions, establish a carbon tax or increase fuel or energy taxes. We have also voluntarily announced goals to reduce our GHG emissions by a target date. These legal requirements, in addition to emission reduction efforts that we voluntarily undertake, are expected to result in increased capital expenditures and compliance costs and could result in higher costs required to operate and maintain our facilities, procure raw materials and energy, and may require us to acquire emission credits or carbon offsets. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities. Proposed rules under the Federal Acquisition Regulation will require major contractors to disclose enhanced information on GHG emissions and commit to GHG emission reduction targets. If these rules become effective and we are unable to comply, we may be ineligible to receive future federal contract awards. The inconsistent international, regional and/or national requirements associated with climate change regulations also create economic and regulatory uncertainty.
Investor sentiment towards climate change and sustainability could adversely affect our business and the market price for our common stock.
Increased investor focus and activism related to climate change and sustainability may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of our sustainability practices. We may face increasing pressure regarding our sustainability disclosures and practices. Additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for sustainability performance before investing in our stock. If we are unable to meet the sustainability standards set by these investors, or if we are unable meet GHG reduction targets we communicate to the public, we may lose investors, our stock price may be negatively impacted, and our reputation may be negatively affected.

Other risks we face
Natural and man-made disasters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, floods, ice storms, rising sea levels, droughts or other natural disasters. Many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in California and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage due to wildfire or mudslides. In November 2018, wildfires impacted areas near our headquarters and principal research and development center in Thousand Oaks, California, resulting in temporary disruptions and evacuations of employees who lived nearby. Local utilities may impose blackouts during high fire risk weather conditions, which could result in disruptions to our businesses located in California, including our headquarters. In January 2023, heavy rains in California resulted in a mudslide that blocked road access to our facility in Tracy, California that makes energetic devices, resulting in several days of plant closure.
In the event of a major earthquake, tornado, hurricane or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, vandalism, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or health epidemic (including COVID), we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, lengthy interruptions in our production, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, all of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition and have a material adverse impact on us. In December 2022, an attack by political extremists on our facility in Presteigne, Wales that makes printed circuit boards resulted in damage to the facility and interrupted some productions lines for a period of time. Teledyne FLIR’s components operations is a single source supplier of certain sensors used throughout the FLIR business, and a disruption in business due to a disaster could have a material adverse impact on the businesses of Teledyne FLIR. Teledyne's facilities in Quebec, Canada have been impacted by loss of electrical power caused by severe ice storms. In addition, we have manufacturing facilities in the southeastern United States and Texas that have been threatened or struck by major hurricanes. In 2017, our businesses located in Houston, Texas were impacted by Hurricane Harvey and our business in Florida was threatened by Hurricanes Irma and Matthew. Our facilities in Alabama, Florida, Nebraska, Tennessee and Virginia have also been threatened by tornados. If any of our California facilities were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss, or if any of our Alabama, Florida, Nebraska, Tennessee or Texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane, storm, tornado or other natural disaster, or if Teledyne’s facilities in Quebec experience long-term loss of electrical power, such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the insurance we maintain may be insufficient to cover our losses resulting from disasters, cyber-attacks or other business interruptions, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, such insurance. Our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans (including those relating to our information technology systems) may not be fully responsive to, or minimize losses associated with, catastrophic events.
Disasters also have an indirect adverse impact on our business. For example, in 2018, a fire at a Netherlands-based facility of a key supplier of printed circuit boards resulted in delivery disruptions to the electronics industry, including to businesses in our Digital Imaging segment.
Adverse findings in matters related to FLIR’s historical export control practices could materially impact us.
Effective April 24, 2022, the United States Department of State’s Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (“DDTC”) closed the four-year Consent Agreement that had been entered into by FLIR Systems, Inc. to resolve allegations regarding various violations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). On April 13, 2022, Teledyne paid $3.5 million as the final installment of the civil penalty under the Consent Agreement. While FLIR and its successor by mergers, Teledyne FLIR, have enhanced the trade compliance program more broadly, implemented remedial measures and have undergone external audits of the ITAR compliance program, future adverse disclosures and findings could cause incurrence of additional expenses in connection with potential penalties or further remedial measures.
In April 2021, FLIR resolved allegations of misrepresentations made to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), between November 2012 and December 2013, in a commodity jurisdiction request relating to newly developed Lepton uncooled focal plane arrays by an administrative settlement and fine of $0.3 million and agreeing to perform two internal audits of its EAR export compliance programs. The first internal audit was completed, and a voluntary disclosure was filed in October 2021 to report potential violations. This case was closed without further action by BIS with the issuance of a warning letter. The second internal audit was completed in October 2022, for which a voluntary disclosure was also filed and is still pending disposition.
FLIR has made other voluntary disclosures to the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce, including to BIS with respect to the shipments of products from non-U.S. jurisdictions which were not authorized due to a potentially incorrect de minimis calculation methodology under the EAR. Furthermore, FLIR has made voluntary disclosures to export authorities in jurisdictions outside the U.S. for certain potential violations of local export laws, which may increase its penalty exposure.

At this time, based on available information, we are unable to reasonably estimate the time it may take to resolve these matters or the amount or range of potential loss, penalty or other government action, if any, that may be incurred in connection with these matters. However, an unfavorable outcome could result in substantial fines and penalties or loss or suspension of export privileges or of particular authorizations that could be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in and following the period in which such an outcome becomes estimable or known.
We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, or third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual rights, each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business.
Our ability to enforce and protect our patents, copyrights, software licenses, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries. When we seek to enforce our rights, we have found that various claims may be asserted against us, including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim. In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties. If we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell a product or family of products due to an injunction, or we may have to pay damages that could, in turn, harm our results of operations. Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business.
Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches.
Attempts by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, crime, activism, or other motivations, include covertly introducing malware into our computers and computer networks, performing reconnaissance, impersonating authorized users, extortion, and stealing, corrupting or restricting our access to data, among other activities. We have in the past experienced cyber-attacks including some loss of confidentiality and some loss of availability, although these attacks have not had material impact on our business. Our customers and suppliers have also experienced successful cyber-attacks, which in some cases resulted in payments by or to us being unlawfully diverted. We continue to train our personnel and update our infrastructure, security tools and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to reduce the likelihood of their occurrence. Company personnel and third parties have been tasked to prevent, deter, detect, respond to, and investigate such incidents; however, it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of or be able to react to an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, corruption, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property or confidential business information due to a cyber-attack could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are subject to U.S. Department of Defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through our information systems, and these regulations have been and will continue to be incorporated into certain U.S. Department of Defense contracts that we hold. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees, third parties or the U.S. Government, or any of the deployed security controls are deemed insufficient, we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances. As a result, we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems, operating technology systems, products and services. More resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the U.S. Government increases its cybersecurity mandates. Unauthorized access to or control of our products, data, devices or systems could impact the safety of our customers and other third parties which could result in legal claims against us. Security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, including GDPR, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, and California Consumer Privacy Act and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. The systemic cybersecurity risk environment is elevated, in part by geopolitical conflicts and tensions, including the war between Ukraine and Russia, the spread of remote working and increased supply chain-related cyber-risks.
Provisions of our governing documents, applicable law, and our Change in Control Severance Agreements could make an acquisition of Teledyne more difficult.
Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware contain several provisions, such as our classified Board, that could make the acquisition of control of Teledyne, in a transaction not approved by our Board, more difficult. We have also entered into Change in Control Severance Agreements with eight members of our current management, which could have an anti-takeover effect. These provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our Company.
Our Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws (“Bylaws”) designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain lawsuits between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a judicial forum that it finds favorable for such lawsuits and make it more costly for our stockholders to bring such lawsuits, which may have the effect of discouraging such lawsuits.

18

Table of Contents

Our Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our Bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause or causes of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including all causes of action asserted against any defendant to such complaint. Our Bylaws also provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to this forum selection provision.
However, this forum selection provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Exchange Act. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and accordingly, the forum selection provision in our Bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.
Nevertheless, this forum selection provision in our Bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers and other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. While we believe the risk of a court declining to enforce the forum selection provision contained in our Bylaws is low, if a court were to find the provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Risks Related to Our Securities
An investment in Teledyne’s Common Stock and other securities involve risks, many of which are beyond our control.
Stock markets in general, including the New York Stock Exchange on which our Common Stock is listed, have experienced a high degree of price and volume fluctuations that are not necessarily related to operating performance of the listed companies. In addition to general economic, political and market conditions, such volatility may be related to: (i) changes from analysts’ expectations in revenues, earnings and other financial results; (ii) strategic actions by other competitors; (iii) changes to budgets or policies of the U.S. and other governments; and (iv) other risks described in this report. We cannot provide assurances as to our Common Stock price, which during fiscal 2022 ranged from a low of $331.10 to a high of $488.63.

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and traded under the symbol “TDY”.
As of February 17, 2023, there were 2,423 holders of record of the Common Stock. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners of our stock represented by these stockholders of record.
We intend to use future earnings to fund the development and growth of our businesses, including through potential acquisitions. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
We have stock repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to approximately three million shares. No repurchases were made since 2015. Although we have no current plans to repurchase stock, up to approximately three million shares may be repurchased under the stock repurchase program. See Note 11 for additional information about our stock repurchase program.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Teledyne provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets that require advanced technology and high reliability. These markets include factory automation and condition monitoring, aerospace and defense, air and water quality environmental monitoring, electronics design and development, medical imaging and pharmaceutical research, oceanographic research, and deepwater energy exploration and production. Following the 2021 acquisition of FLIR, we further evolved into a global sensing and decision-support technology company: providing specialty sensors, cameras, instrumentation, algorithms and software across the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as unmanned systems, in the subsea, land and air domains. We differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer and Company-sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise. We believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete.
Information about results of operations and financial condition for 2021 and 2020 can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” sections in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2022.

Strategy/Overview
Our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our four business segments: digital imaging, instrumentation, aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems. The markets in which we sell our enabling technologies are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized. We intend to strengthen and expand our business with targeted acquisitions and through product development. We continue to focus on balanced and disciplined capital deployment among capital expenditures, acquisitions and product development. We aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings by emphasizing cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of our business. At Teledyne, operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire. Using complementary technology across our businesses and through targeted research and development, we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets. We continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy.

COVID and Other Matters impact
With regard to the COVID pandemic, our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their families. Although the COVID pandemic has impacted our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions from COVID in 2022, mostly as a result of COVID-related lockdowns in China and localized and temporary labor shortages due to virus exposure. However, given the continuing dynamic nature of this situation, we may not fully estimate the impacts of COVID on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Contingency plans remain in place in the event of significant impacts from COVID infection resurgences, and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.
We have experienced supply chain challenges, including increased lead times, as well as cost inflation for parts and components, logistics and labor due to availability constraints and high demand. This has delayed our ability to convert

20

Table of Contents

backlog to revenue and negatively impacted our profit margins. We expect inflationary and supply chain constraint trends to continue in 2023.
Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies adversely impacted our sales in 2022, and may continue to do so in future periods. It may also increase the price and reduce the competitiveness of some of our products sold in markets outside the United States.
We do not have any material business, operations or assets in Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, and to date we have not been materially impacted by the actions of the Russian government. Our total net sales from these three countries in 2022 and 2021 constituted less than 1.0% of total net sales, respectively.
As part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance, as well as to respond to the impact of the COVID pandemic, beginning in 2020 we commenced actions to reduce headcount across various businesses, reducing our exposure to weak end markets, such as commercial aerospace. We also exited certain facilities no longer needed. In 2021, we took actions to integrate FLIR into our businesses resulting in higher severance and facility closure costs in the Digital Imaging segment. In 2021, we incurred $26.4 million of severance and facility consolidation costs, primarily related to our Digital Imaging Segment. Severance and facility consolidation costs incurred in 2022 were not material, and, at January 1, 2023, an immaterial amount remains to be paid related to these actions.

Recent Acquisitions
Consistent with our strategy, we completed two acquisitions in 2022 and one acquisition in 2021. Our May 2021 acquisition of FLIR was our largest acquisition to date. The financial results of these acquisitions have been included since the respective date of each acquisition. All acquisitions in 2022 and 2021 were part of the Digital Imaging segment. See Note 3 for additional information about our recent acquisitions. As discussed in Note 18, we have completed one acquisition in early 2023, which is part of the Digital Imaging segment.

Consolidated Operating Results
Our fiscal year is determined based on a 52- or 53-week convention ending on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Fiscal years 2022 and 2021 each contained 52 weeks. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. In the current year, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment is presented as separate line item on the income statement.
Our businesses are aligned in four segments: Digital Imaging, Instrumentation, Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Engineered Systems. Additional financial information about our business segments can be found in Note 4.
The following are financial highlights for 2022 and 2021 (in millions, except per-share amounts):

Net Sales:
Net sales increased across all business segments. Refer to the “Segments” discussion later in this section for additional discussion of changes in net sales. Sales to international customers represented approximately 47% of net sales in 2022 and 47% of net sales in 2021. Approximately 25% and 26% of our total net sales 2022 and 2021, respectively, were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales increased by $355.4 million in 2022, primarily driven by the impact of higher net sales. Cost of sales in 2021 included $106.4 million recorded in 2021 related to acquired inventory step-up expense from the acquisition of FLIR. No comparable inventory step-up expense was recorded in 2022. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2022 was 57.3%, compared with 60.1% for 2021, with the decrease in percentage from 2021 primarily related to the 2021 impact of acquired inventory step-up expense from the FLIR acquisition.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses, including research and development expense, were higher in 2022, primarily driven by higher net sales in 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2021 included $102.7 million in acquisition-related transaction and purchase accounting expenses related to the FLIR acquisition. Corporate expense in 2022 was $65.9 million, compared with $136.8 million in 2021. The higher 2021 amount included $77.1 million in acquisition-related transaction and purchase accounting expenses related to the FLIR acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 21.2% for 2022, compared with 23.2% for 2021. The higher percentage in 2021 primarily reflected the impact of acquisition-related transaction and purchase accounting expenses related to the FLIR acquisition.
Acquired Intangible Asset Amortization
Acquired intangible asset amortization for 2022 was $201.7 million, compared with $149.3 million for 2021, with the increase primarily related to a full year of acquired intangible asset amortization in 2022 from the FLIR acquisition.
Operating Income
Operating income for 2022 was $972.0 million, compared with $624.3 million for 2021, an increase of 55.7%. The increase in operating income primarily reflected higher operating income in each segment except the Engineered Systems

segment. Corporate expense for 2022 was $65.9 million compared with $136.8 million, and the 2021 amount included $77.1 million in acquisition-related transaction and purchase accounting expenses related to the FLIR acquisition.

Non-operating Income and Expenses
Interest expense, including credit facility fees and other bank charges and net of interest income, was $89.3 million in 2022, compared with $90.8 million in 2021, with the 2022 year including a full year of debt outstanding since the FLIR acquisition. The 2021 amount reflected interest and debt fees incurred to fund the cash portion of the FLIR acquisition, which included $30.6 million in bridge loan fees. In 2022, the Company repurchased and retired $75.0 million of its Fixed Rate Senior Notes due August 2030 and April 2031, recording a $10.6 million non-cash gain on the extinguishment of this debt. In 2021, the Company called $493.3 million of existing fixed rate senior notes and incurred debt extinguishment expenses of $13.4 million.
Income Taxes
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was 13.1%, compared with 16.6% for 2021. For 2022, net discrete income tax benefits were $86.7 million, which primarily related to income tax benefits of $72.7 million for acquisition-related tax matters and $10.2 million income tax benefits related to share-based accounting. For 2021, net discrete income tax benefits were $34.7 million, which primarily related to income tax benefits of $18.2 million for acquisition-related tax matters and $13.1 million income tax benefit related to share-based accounting. Excluding the net discrete income tax benefits in both years, the effective tax rates would have been 22.7% for 2022 and 23.1% for 2021.

2022 compared with 2021
Our Engineered Systems segment net sales for 2022 increased 1.4%, compared with 2021. Operating income for 2022 decreased 19.3%, compared with 2021.
The 2022 net sales increase primarily reflected $8.2 million of higher sales for energy systems and $2.5 million of higher sales for engineered products, partially offset by lower sales of $5.2 million for turbine engines. The higher net sales for engineered products primarily reflected increased sales from marine and electronic manufacturing services programs products, partially offset by decreased sales in missile defense and space programs. Teledyne exited the cruise missile turbine engine business in the first quarter of 2021. Operating income in 2022 primarily reflected the impact of unfavorable product mix, primarily related to electronic manufacturing services products and turbine engines.
Cost of sales for 2022 increased by $13.7 million, compared with 2021, and primarily reflected the impact of higher net sales and unfavorable product mix. Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for 2022 increased to 84.2%, compared with 81.9% in 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including research and development and bid and proposal expense, increased to $25.9 million in 2022, compared with $24.7 million in 2021. The selling, general and administrative expense percentage increased to 6.3% for 2022 compared to 6.1% in 2021.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Principal Cash and Capital Requirements
Our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments and debt service requirements, as well as acquisitions. It is anticipated that operating cash flow, together with available borrowings under the credit facility and the debt financing arrangements described below, will be sufficient to meet these requirements. To support acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital. Our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of off-balance sheet financial arrangements. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $638.1 million at January 1, 2023, of which $403.2 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money-market mutual funds and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
Long-term Debt
Long-term debt, including unamortized debt issuance costs was $3,920.6 million at January 1, 2023 compared to $4,099.4 million at January 2, 2022. During 2022, the Company repaid $185.0 million of debt. The Company made $110.0 million of floating rate debt payments on its term loan due May 2026. The Company also repurchased and retired $75.0 million of its Fixed Rate Senior Notes due August 2030 and April 2031, recording a $10.6 million non-cash gain on the extinguishment of this debt.

Table of Contents

At January 1, 2023, we had $38.6 million in outstanding letters of credit.
The credit agreement and term loans require the Company to comply with various financial and operating covenants and at January 1, 2023, the Company was in compliance with these covenants and had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios. Currently, we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing, if needed, is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements. Available borrowing capacity under the $1.15 billion credit facility, which is reduced by borrowings and $21.3 million in outstanding letters of credit, was $1,003.7 million at January 1, 2023.
See Note 8 for additional information regarding our credit facility and long-term debt.
Contractual Obligations
The following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at January 1, 2023:

-------------------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ---- ---- ----- ---- ---- ----- ---------- ----- ----- ----- - ---- ----- - ------- - -------
Contractual obligations (in millions): 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2026 Total
Debt obligations $ 300.1 $ 601.0 $ 0.3 $ 820.3 $ 0.3 $ 2,225.1 $ 3,947.1
Interest expense (a) 99.2 93.9 86.0 67.3 56.9 129.2 532.5
Operating lease obligations (b) 35.3 29.5 25.9 20.8 16.9 48.4 176.8

Purchase obligations (c) 309.0 13.9 3.6 1.9 0.1 0.4 328.9
Total $ 743.6 $ 738.3 $ 115.8 $ 910.3 $ 74.2 $ 2,403.1 $ 4,985.3

(a)    Interest expense related to the credit facility, including facility fees, is assumed to accrue at the rates in effect at year-end 2022 and is assumed to be paid at the end of each quarter with the final payment in March 2026 when the credit facility expires.
(b)        Includes imputed interest and the short-term portion of lease obligations.
(c)    Purchase obligations generally include contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services and capital commitments that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
Unrecognized tax benefits of $162.8 million and accrued interest and penalties on these tax matters of $45.6 million are not included in the table above. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties are not included in the table above because $32.1 million is offset by deferred tax assets, and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history and offsetting credits.
At January 1, 2023, we were not required, and accordingly are not planning, to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plans for 2023. Our minimum funding requirements after 2022 as set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, are dependent on several factors as discussed under “Accounting for Pension Plans” in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Estimates beyond 2023 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change until the Company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times. In addition, certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government under certain government contracts, therefore, future cash contributions are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity. We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 10. Teledyne monitors and manages its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $486.8 million and $824.6 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The lower cash provided by operating activities in 2022, compared with 2021 primarily resulted from a payment of $296.4 million to the Swedish Tax Authority in the first quarter of 2022, related to a disputed pre-acquisition 2018 tax reassessment issued to a FLIR subsidiary in Sweden, greater inventory purchases in 2022 as compared to 2021, to mitigate supply chain constraints and higher income tax payments of $128.8 million in 2022. These changes were partially offset by higher net income in 2022.
Free cash flow (cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) and adjusted free cash flow (both non-GAAP measures) were as follows (in millions):

------------------------------------------------------------ ------ ----- ------- - ----- -----
Free Cash Flow(a) 2022 2021
Cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 486.8 $ 824.6

Less: Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment (92.6) (101.6)

Free cash flow 394.2 723.0
Add back: Payment for acquisition-related tax matter 296.4 —
Add back: FLIR transaction-related cash payments, net of tax — 71.6
Adjusted free cash flow $ 690.6 $ 794.6

(a) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities (a measure prescribed by GAAP) less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. Adjusted free cash flow eliminates the impact of cash paid for transaction related expenses for the FLIR acquisition on a net of tax basis as

Table of Contents

well as the payment of a pre-acquisition 2018 tax reassessment issued to a FLIR subsidiary in Sweden. We believe that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to assist management and the investment community in analyzing the company’s ability to generate cash flow.

Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $175.4 million and $3,824.3 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Investing activities used cash for acquisitions and other investments of $99.6 million and $3,723.3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively (see “Recent Acquisitions”). Teledyne funded the acquisitions from borrowings under its credit facilities, issuance of senior notes and term loans, the issuance of Teledyne common stock and cash on hand.
Cash flows relating to investing activities for capital expenditures.

----------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- - -----

Capital expenditures (in millions): 2022 2021
Digital Imaging $ 63.9 $ 64.2
Instrumentation 9.3 13.3
Aerospace and Defense Electronics 8.0 8.4
Engineered Systems 5.3 12.9
Corporate 6.1 2.8
 $ 92.6 $ 101.6

During 2023, we plan to invest approximately $100 million in capital expenditures, principally to upgrade facilities and manufacturing equipment.
Financing Activities
Financing activities reflected net payments from debt of $174.8 million in 2022 and net proceeds from debt of $2,834.2 million in 2021. Fiscal years 2022 and 2021 reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $23.6 million and $25.4 million, respectively.
During 2022, the Company repaid $185.0 million of debt. The Company made $110.0 million of floating rate debt payments on its term loan due May 2026. The Company also repurchased and retired $75.0 million of its Fixed Rate Senior Notes due August 2030 and April 2031, recording a $10.6 million non-cash gain on the extinguishment of this debt.
During 2021, the Company completed various financing activities as follows, with activity through the first half of 2021 primarily related to funding the cash portion of the FLIR acquisition:
•On January 4, 2021, the Company entered into a $4.5 billion short term stand-by bridge facility to support the completion of the FLIR acquisition, resulting in debt expense of $17.2 million.
•On March 4, 2021, the Company entered into a $1.0 billion Term Loan Credit Agreement (maturing May 2026) and an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (maturing March 2026) with capacity of $1.15 billion. The terms of the $1.0 billion Term Loan Credit Agreement allow for prepayments, at the Company’s option, at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part without premium or penalty.
•On March 17, 2021, the Company called $493.3 million of existing fixed rate senior notes and incurred debt extinguishment expenses of $13.4 million, which is included in interest and debt expense, net.
•On March 22, 2021, the Company completed all permanent financing for the acquisition of FLIR and terminated the $4.5 billion stand-by bridge facility. The permanent financing consists of $3.0 billion investment-grade bonds (the “Notes”), including $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.65% Notes due 2023, $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.95% Notes due 2024, $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.60% Notes due 2026, $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Notes due 2028 and $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.75% Notes due 2031. Teledyne may redeem the $450.0 million of 0.95% Notes due 2024 at any time or from time to time, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, from and after April 1, 2022, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed.
•As part of the acquisition of FLIR, the Company assumed and guaranteed FLIR’s $500.0 million, 2.50% Fixed Rate Senior Notes due August 2030.
•In the second half of 2021, the Company made $645.0 million of floating rate debt payments on its term loan due May 2026.
Other Matters
Pension Plans
Teledyne has two domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees hired before January 1, 2004, or approximately 5% of Teledyne’s active employees as of January 1, 2023. As of January 1, 2004, new U.S. hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan. In 2022 and 2021, Teledyne was not required, and did not make any cash contributions to the domestic pension plans. For the Company’s domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans, the discount rate for 2023 will increase to an average of 5.71% from 2.97% in 2022. The Company also has several small non-qualified domestic and foreign-based defined benefit pension plans.

Income Taxes
Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
The Company continually evaluates its global cash needs and has historically asserted that most of its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and did not generally record deferred taxes on such amounts. During 2022, the Company determined that it could no longer make the assertion foreign earnings are permanently reinvested, as cash from most foreign subsidiaries may be remitted without incurring additional U.S. federal income tax. As a result, the Company changed its indefinite reinvestment assertion of unremitted earnings and certain other aspects of outside basis differences on a majority of its foreign subsidiaries.
The Company continues to make an indefinite reinvestment assertion on the historic excess of the financial reporting bases over tax bases in its material foreign subsidiaries in Canada. The unremitted earnings of the Company’s Canadian foreign subsidiaries held for indefinite reinvestment are used to finance Canadian operations and investments. The Company estimate that future cash generation from non-Canadian operations will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements. Determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for unremitted Canadian earnings is not practicable due to uncertainty and overall complexity of the potential calculations. The Company continues to evaluate its cash needs and may update its assertion in future periods.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income. Based on the Company’s history of operating earnings, expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies, management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance.
We file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded on all U.S. federal income tax matters for all years through 2011, Canadian income tax matters for all years through 2012, Swedish income tax matters for all years through 2016, Norwegian income tax matters for all years through 2017, Belgian income tax matters for all years through 2019, French income tax matters for all years through 2019 and United Kingdom income tax matters for all years through 2014.
Costs and Pricing
Inflation has been rising in the markets in which we operate. Current inventory costs, the increasing costs of labor, materials, equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies. The Company emphasizes cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of its business.
Market Risk Disclosures
Our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks. We own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to market risk through the interest rate on our borrowings under our $1.15 billion credit facility and our term loan due May 2026. As of January 1, 2023, all outstanding borrowings under our floating rate credit facility were subject to existing interest rate swap agreements, and $245.0 million outstanding under our floating rate term loan due May 2026 was exposed to interest rate risk. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $2.5 million, assuming the $245.0 million term loan was outstanding for the full year.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
Teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting the Company to foreign currency risk. The Company’s primary foreign currency risk management objective is to protect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings, primarily achieved through the following:
•The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to

28

Table of Contents

forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in Canadian dollars for our Canadian companies, and in British pounds for our U.K. companies. These contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.
•The Company has converted U.S. dollar denominated, variable rate and fixed rate debt obligations of a European subsidiary, into euro fixed rate obligations using a receive float, pay fixed cross currency swap, and a receive fixed, pay fixed cross currency swap. These cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges.
•The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany receivables and payables.
All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes.

Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. A hypothetical 10% price change of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 1, 2023, would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy Canadian dollars and to sell U.S. dollars by approximately $12.6 million. A hypothetical 10% price change in the U.S. dollar from its value at January 1, 2023 would result in a decrease in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy British Pounds and to sell U.S. dollars by approximately $1.7 million. A hypothetical 10% price change in the U.S. dollar from its value at January 1, 2023 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our Euro/U.S. Dollar cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges by approximately $30.8 million.
Environmental
We are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. These include sites at which Teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites. Reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled $5.8 million and $6.3 million as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. As investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received, the Company will adjust reserves to reflect new information. Based on current information, we do not believe that future environmental costs, in excess of those already accrued, will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity. See also our environmental risk factor disclosure in Item 1A. Risk Factors as well as additional discussion in Notes 2 and 17.
Government Contracts
We perform work on a number of contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other agencies and departments of the U.S. Government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors. Sales under these contracts with the U.S. Government, which included contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, were approximately 25% and 26% of our total net sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively. For a summary of sales to the U.S. Government by segment, see Note 4. Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense represented approximately 20% and 19% of total net sales for 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations, which usually are made available on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. See also our government contracts risks factor disclosure in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
For information on accounts receivable from the U.S. Government, see Note 7.
Estimates and Reserves
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to product returns and replacements, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, pension and other postretirement benefits, long-term contracts, environmental, workers’ compensation and general liability, employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time, the results of which form the basis for making our judgments. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In some cases, such differences may be material. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for further information on key estimates.
Some of the Company’s products are subject to standard warranties and the Company provides for the estimated cost of

Table of Contents

product warranties. We regularly assess the adequacy of our pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historical warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products, as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties, which are typically one year. See further discussion in Note 7.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment, complexity and uncertainty, and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following as critical accounting policies: revenue recognition; accounting for business combinations, goodwill and acquired intangible assets; accounting for income taxes; and accounting for pension plans. For additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2.
Revenue Recognition
Prior to the acquisition of FLIR, approximately 40% of our revenue was recognized over time, with the remaining 60% of our revenue recognized at a point in time. The majority of Teledyne FLIR revenue is recognized at a point in time. In 2022, approximately 30% of revenue was recognized over time, with the remaining 70% recognized at a point in time.
Revenue recognized over time relates primarily to contracts to design, develop and/or manufacture highly engineered products used in both defense and commercial applications. The transaction price in these arrangements may include estimated amounts of variable consideration, including award fees, incentive fees, contract amounts not yet funded, or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled, and we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the estimation uncertainty is resolved. The estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. As control transfers continuously over time on these contracts, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress as this measure best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.
For over time contracts using the cost-to-cost method, we have an Estimate at Completion (“EAC”) process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations. This EAC process requires management judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue, determining reasonably dependable cost estimates, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Since certain contracts extend over a longer period of time, the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings through a cumulative catch-up basis. This method recognizes, in the current period, the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters. Additionally, if the current contract estimate indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident. Contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly.
 We do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2022 and 2021 was material to the consolidated statement of income for such annual periods.
Revenue recognized at a point in time relates primarily to the sale of standard or minimally customized products, with control transferring to the customer generally upon the transfer of title. See Note 5 for additional revenue recognition disclosures.
Business Combinations, Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
The results for all acquisitions are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition. Business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. We determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities, often in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period.
Goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. We review goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. We test goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or

30

Table of Contents

circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors.
We may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform a quantitative test for each reporting unit at least once every three years.
For goodwill impairment testing using the quantitative approach, we estimate the fair value of the selected reporting units primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans, and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values over a multi-year period. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill may be overstated, and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.
When using a quantitative approach, changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the Company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company will apply a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit subject to a quantitative impairment test and compare those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis. Recently acquired reporting units generally represent a higher inherent risk of impairment, which typically decreases as the businesses are integrated into the Company.
As of January 1, 2023, the Company had ten reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. In the fourth quarter of 2022, a qualitative test was performed for each reporting unit excluding the FLIR reporting unit, and the carrying value of goodwill included in these nine reporting units subject to the current year qualitative test ranged from $20.4 million to $889.7 million. The Company’s qualitative analysis in 2022 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. For the FLIR reporting unit, the Company bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative test in the fourth quarter of 2022. At the assessment date, the FLIR reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, which included $5,748.0 million of goodwill, by approximately 14%. Although no impairment exists for the FLIR reporting unit, an impairment of goodwill could result from a number of circumstances, including different assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit, changes to customer spending priorities, or a sharp increase in interest rates without a corresponding increase in future net sales.
Income Taxes
For a description of the Company’s tax accounting policies, refer to Note 2 and Note 9. We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. In addition, uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns which may impact income tax expense. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate which is dependent on the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. Although we believe our income tax expense is reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions. To the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. An increase of 100 basis points in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, of $9.1 million.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards. Significant management judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against the deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change

31

Table of Contents

our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations across domestic and foreign jurisdictions. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite the belief that our tax positions are supportable, there remains uncertainty in a tax position taken in our filed tax returns or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim. We follow a recognition and measurement approach, considering the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. Judgment is exercised in determining the level of evidence necessary and appropriate to support its assessment using all available information. The technical merits of a given tax position are derived from sources of authority in the tax law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the position. In measuring the tax position, we consider the amount and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon settlement. When it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained, we record a liability for the anticipated tax and interest due upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, increased in 2021 due to the acquisition of FLIR. During the first quarter of 2022, we paid approximately $296.4 million related to an acquired uncertain tax position; refer to Note 3 for additional detail. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, there could be a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and annual results of operations.
Pension Plans
The Company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. In consultation with our actuaries, we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits. Net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor. The accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10% of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization. For our plan which covers mostly inactive participants, gains and losses subject to amortization are amortized over the average participants future life expectancy which is approximately 17 years. This plan represents the majority of the pension obligations. For our other plan, gains and losses subject to amortization are amortized over the average employee future service period which is approximately nine years. Significant assumptions used in determining our pension income or expense are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant mortality estimates, expected rates of increase in future compensation levels, employee turnover, as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations.
Differences in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2022 pension expense (in millions):

------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------ ----- ------------------------------ - ---
 0.25 Percentage Point Increase 0.25 Percentage Point Decrease
Increase (decrease) to pension expense resulting from:
Change in discount rate $ (0.1) $ 0.1
Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets $ (2.1) $ 2.1

See Note 10 for additional pension disclosures.

Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, directly and indirectly relating to earnings, growth opportunities, acquisitions and divestitures, product sales, capital expenditures, pension matters, stock option compensation expense, the credit facility, interest expense, severance and relocation costs, statements and goals relating to greenhouse gas emission reductions, environmental remediation cost, stock repurchases, taxes, exchange rate fluctuations and strategic plans. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are based on the current expectations of the management of Teledyne and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. All statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical in nature should be considered forward-looking. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Many factors could change the anticipated results, including: ongoing challenges and uncertainties posed by the COVID pandemic for businesses and governments around the world, including production, supply, contractual and other disruptions, such as COVID-related lockdowns, facility closures, furloughs and travel restrictions; changes in relevant tax and other laws; foreign currency exchange risks; rising interest rates; risks associated with indebtedness, as well as our ability to reduce indebtedness and the timing thereof; the impact of semiconductor and other supply chain shortages, higher inflation, including wage competition and higher shipping costs; labor shortages and competition for skilled personnel; the inability to develop and market new competitive products; inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of financial statements and the providing of estimates of financial measures, in accordance with U.S. GAAP and related standards;

disruptions in the global economy; the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including the impact to energy prices and availability, especially in Europe; customer and supplier bankruptcies; changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics, instrumentation, digital imaging, energy exploration and production, commercial aviation, semiconductor and communications markets; funding, continuation and award of government programs; cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures or changes to U.S. and foreign government spending and budget priorities triggered by the COVID pandemic; impacts from the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union; uncertainties related to the policies of the U.S. Presidential Administration; the imposition and expansion of, and responses to, trade sanctions and tariffs; the continuing review and resolution of FLIR’s export and tax matters; escalating economic and diplomatic tension between China and the United States; threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information, including cybersecurity threats; natural and man-made disasters, including those related to or intensified by climate change; and our ability to achieve emission reduction targets and decrease our carbon footprint. Lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as instability in the Middle East or other oil producing regions, and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production, including those implemented in response to climate change, could further negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry. Weakness in the commercial aerospace industry negatively affects the markets of our commercial aviation businesses. In addition, financial market fluctuations affect the value of the Company’s pension assets. Changes in the policies of U.S. and foreign governments, including economic sanctions, could result, over time, in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the Company participates.
While Teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions, we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made. Acquisitions, including the recent acquisition of ChartWorld, involve various inherent risks, such as, among others, our ability to integrate acquired businesses, retain key management and customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies. There are additional risks associated with acquiring, owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from U.S. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations.
We continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we believe our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained beginning on page 6 of this Form 10-K under the caption “Risk Factors; Cautionary Statement as to Forward-Looking Statements.” Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate”, “project”, “predict”, “believes” or “expect”, that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

NOTE 18. LEASES We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2032. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material variable payment provisions or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense was $121 million for fiscal 2022 and $119 million for both fiscal 2021 and 2020. We recognized operating lease expense in cost of revenue and operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our operating lease expense includes variable lease costs and is net of sublease income, both of which are not material. Supplemental cash flow information for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to operating leases was as follows: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---- ---- - ---- - -- (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 107 $ 116 $ 99 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $ 59 $ 60 $ 52 The weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for our operating lease liabilities as of December 2, 2022 were 7 years and 2.37%, respectively. As of December 2, 2022, the maturities of lease liabilities under operating leases were as follows: ---------------------------------- -------------------- --- (in millions) Fiscal Year Operating Leases (1) 2023 $ 95 2024 78 2025 74 2026 67 2027 67 Thereafter 167 Total lease liabilities $ 548 Less: Imputed interest 44 Present value of lease liabilities $ 504 _________________________________________ (1) Legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced as of December 2, 2022 were not material. 88  ADOBE INC.

As of December 31, 2022, construction in progress also includes $2.18 billion of servers and network assets components stored by our suppliers until required by our design manufacturers to fulfill certain purchase orders. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $8.50 billion, $7.56 billion, and $6.39 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The majority of the property and equipment depreciation expense was from servers and network assets depreciation of $5.29 billion, $4.94 billion, and $4.38 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful life of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $1.34 billion abandonment charge and $508 million impairment loss for data center assets and leasehold improvements assets, respectively, as a result of our restructuring efforts. For additional information, see Note 3 -- Restructuring.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES Income before income taxes for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following: -------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - ----- (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Domestic $ 1,958 $ 1,736 $ 1,090 Foreign 4,050 3,969 3,086 Income before income taxes $ 6,008 $ 5,705 $ 4,176 The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following: ----------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ----- ---- --- ------- - ------- (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Current: United States federal $ 465 $ 391 $ 119 Foreign 329 197 222 State and local 132 103 79 Total current 926 691 420 Deferred: United States federal (45) (148) (123) Foreign 360 359 (1,313) State and local 11 (19) (68) Total deferred 326 192 (1,504) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 1,252 $ 883 $ (1,084) Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights ("IP rights") During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...
