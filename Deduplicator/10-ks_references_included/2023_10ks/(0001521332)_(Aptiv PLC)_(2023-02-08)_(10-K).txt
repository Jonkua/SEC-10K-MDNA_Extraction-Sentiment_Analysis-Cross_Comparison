which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial long-term growth. Our ten largest platforms in 2022 were with seven different OEMs. In addition, in 2022 our products were found in 18 of the 20 top-selling vehicle models in the United States (“U.S.”), in 18 of the 20 top-selling vehicle models in Europe and in 12 of the 20 top-selling vehicle models in China.
We have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from best cost countries. This regional model is structured primarily to service the North American market from Mexico, the South American market from Brazil, the European market from Eastern Europe and North Africa, and the Asia Pacific market from China. Our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest OEMs, which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis. Our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global OEMs require while also serving key growth market OEMs.
Our Industry
The automotive technology and components industry provides critical technologies, components, systems, subsystems and modules to OEMs for the manufacture of new vehicles, as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles. In addition, the industry is increasingly progressing towards software-defined vehicles becoming critical elements of the overall automotive ecosystem. Overall, we expect long-term growth of global vehicle sales and production in the OEM market. In 2022, the industry experienced increased global customer sales and production schedules, despite the ongoing adverse impacts of global supply chain disruptions and increased global inflationary pressures. Global automotive vehicle production increased 5% (5% on an Aptiv weighted market basis, which represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the Company generates its revenue) from 2021 to 2022, reflecting increased vehicle production of 10% in North America, 3% in China and 8% in South America, our smallest region, and a decrease of 1% in Europe. Demand for automotive components in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive technology and components industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets. We believe that evolving entrants into the global transportation industry such as mobility providers, electric vehicle developers and smart cities will provide additional markets for our advanced technologies. We believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities, we are well-positioned to benefit from these opportunities.
We believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “mega-trends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of market-driven automotive technology advancement. We aim to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these mega-trends, and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers, both OEMs and others, to produce distinctive market-leading products. We have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these mega-trends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our customers.
Safe. The first mega-trend, “Safe,” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs, but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring. OEMs continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets. As a result, suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs, as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring. Examples of new and alternative technologies that incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning and centering systems, adaptive cruise control and traffic jam assist, and driver and cabin monitoring systems.
Green. The second mega-trend, “Green,” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions, increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles. Green is a key mega-trend today because of the convergence of several issues: climate change, volatility in oil prices, an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in every region regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. OEMs continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets. On a worldwide basis, the relevant authorities in the largest markets in which we operate have already instituted regulations requiring reductions in emissions and/or increased fuel economy. In many cases, other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2023 and beyond. Based on the current regulatory environment, we believe that OEMs, including those in the U.S. and China, will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions over the next ten years. For example, in the U.S., the California Air Resources Board

approved new rules, which require that all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in California be electric vehicles or other emissions-free models by 2035. Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2021 finalized more stringent GHG emissions standards for passenger car and light trucks for model years 2023-2026. These and other standards will require meaningful innovation as OEMs and suppliers are challenged to find ways to improve engine management, electrical power consumption, vehicle weight and integration of electric vehicles and alternative technologies. As a result, suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy, emissions and performance from internal combustion engines and electric vehicles. At the same time, suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support electric vehicles, hybrid vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions. We are developing key enabling technologies in the areas of vehicle charging and vehicle power distribution and control that are essential to the introduction of our customers’ electrified vehicle platforms. We are also enabling the trend towards vehicle electrification with high voltage electrification solutions that reduce CO2 emissions and increase fuel economy, helping to make the world greener.
Connected. The third mega-trend, “Connected,” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate today’s highly complex vehicles into the electronic operating environment, and provide drivers with connectivity to the global information network. The technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety, personalization, infotainment, productivity and convenience while driving, which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content. Also with increased smart device usage in vehicles, driver distractions can be dramatically increased, which in turn results in greater risk of accidents. We are pioneering vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger, reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety, while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles. We also utilize advanced connectivity solutions such as over-the-air (OTA) technology that enable vehicles to receive software updates remotely and collect market-relevant data from connected vehicles.
We expect these mega-trends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us. We believe we are well-positioned to provide solutions and products to OEMs to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles. We also believe electronics integration, which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits, software algorithms, sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow OEMs to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity, resulting in easier assembly, enhanced fuel economy, improved emissions control and better vehicle performance.
Convergence of Safe, Green and Connected Solutions in New Mobility and Autonomous Driving
The combination of advanced technologies being developed within these mega-trends is also contributing to increasing industry development of autonomous driving technologies, leading to a fully automated driving experience. We expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for long-term growth for our product offerings in this space, including new potential customers such as mobility providers and smart cities that require solutions to increasing urban mobility challenges. Societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety (resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control), environmental improvements (a reduction in CO2 emissions resulting from optimized driving behavior), labor cost savings and improved productivity (as a result of alternate uses for drive time). Growth opportunities in this space result from increased content, additional computing power and software requirements, enhanced connectivity systems and increased electrification and interconnects. We believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services, as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements.
As part of our strategy to harness the full potential of connected intelligent systems across industries, strengthen our capabilities in software-defined mobility and to enable advanced smart vehicle architecture changes, we acquired Wind River Systems, Inc. (“Wind River”) in December 2022. Wind River is a global leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge. Previously, in 2021, we executed a strategic collaboration agreement with Wind River to develop a software toolchain for various automotive applications.
We are also continuing to invest in the automated driving space, and have continued to develop market-leading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software, key active safety sensing technologies and our multi-domain controller, which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions. We believe we are well-aligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space, and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies.
In March 2020, to further our leadership position in the automated driving space, we completed a transaction with Hyundai Motor Group (“Hyundai”) to form Motional AD LLC (“Motional”), a joint venture focused on the design,

development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies. Motional brings together one of the industry’s most innovative vehicle technology providers with one of the world’s largest OEMs. We expect this partnership to accelerate the path towards the development of production-ready autonomous driving systems for commercialization in the new mobility space.
We believe that substantial strategic value will be created from our partnership with Hyundai through our commitment to a shared mission of making driverless vehicles a safe, reliable and accessible reality. Furthermore, we anticipate Motional’s presence in both North America and Asia, along with the global presence of both Aptiv and Hyundai, to generate economies of scale to support the development of a complete autonomous driving platform, as well as to facilitate mobility infrastructure advancements.
Motional began testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and began testing a production-ready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers, meal delivery providers, fleet operators and automotive manufacturers at prototype scale in 2022, with higher volume production deployments anticipated in late 2023. In addition, Motional is involved in collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as Boston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Singapore as solutions are developed for the evolving nature of the mobility industry.
To guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within the Safe, Green and Connected mega-trends, we utilize and benefit from our Technology Advisory Council, a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders.
Standardization of Sourcing by OEMs
Many OEMs have adopted global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEMs select suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, are best positioned to benefit from this trend. OEMs are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs. As a result, suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers (Tier I suppliers) have assumed many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers. Suppliers that can provide fully-engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing.
Shorter Product Development Cycles
As a result of government regulations and customer preferences, OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. While these trends are more prevalent in mature markets, certain key growth markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation.

Supply Relationships with Our Customers
We typically supply products to our OEM customers through purchase orders, which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM. Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer, they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. These relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or foreign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the end-user of the vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products.
Individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or non-performance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and certain change of control events. In addition, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program, and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program, which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts. We manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels.
Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of OEM production during such future periods, customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials, sub-components and work-in-process inventory for OEM orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.
Materials
We procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs. The most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins. As of December 31, 2022, we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials, however, as a result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations, our balance of productive, raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels. These changes to the production environment have been primarily driven by the worldwide semiconductor shortage. We continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the

efficient use of working capital. Normally we do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules.
Commodity cost volatility, most notably related to copper, petroleum-based resin products and fuel, is a challenge for us and our industry. Recently, the industry has been subjected to increased pricing pressures, specifically in relation to these commodities, which have experienced significant volatility in price. We have also been impacted globally by increased overall inflation as a result of a variety of global trends. We are continually seeking to manage these and other material-related cost pressures using a combination of strategies, including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs, seeking alternative product designs and material specifications, combining our purchase requirements with our customers and/or suppliers, changing suppliers, hedging of certain commodities and other means. In the case of copper, which primarily affects our Signal and Power Solutions segment, contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products. Other than in the case of copper, our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited. However, in 2022, we have negotiated, and will continue to negotiate, price increases with our customers in response to the global supply chain disruptions impacting the automotive industry. We will continue our efforts to pass market-driven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts, including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire.
Seasonality
In general, our business is moderately seasonal, as our primary North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December. Our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December. Our Chinese customers generally halt operations for one week during the months of February and October. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of component production for new vehicle models.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 160,000 people; 32,000 salaried employees and 128,000 hourly employees. In addition, we maintain a contingent workforce of approximately 42,000 to accommodate fluctuations in customer demand. We are a global company serving every major worldwide market. As of December 31, 2022 our workforce is distributed as follows:
•53% in North America, with our largest presence in Mexico;
•31% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, with our largest presence in Morocco and Serbia;
•12% in the Asia Pacific region, with our largest presence in China and India; and
•4% in South America, with our largest presence in Brazil.
Certain of our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils, including the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers - Communications Workers of America, IG Metall and the Confederacion De Trabajadores Mexicanos. We maintain collaborative and constructive labor relationships with our employee representatives in order to foster positive employee relations.
Talent Development
Our people are central to our mission of developing safer, greener and more connected solutions. We continually strive to create and maintain an environment where innovation thrives and our employees are empowered to think and act like owners. To this end, we continually provide coaching and mentoring to our employees at all levels, as well as internal job opportunities including global rotations and stretch assignments to help our employees develop and grow their careers. This dedication to employee growth and development was demonstrated by more than half of our management role openings being filled through internal promotions in 2022. We manage succession planning as part of our operating cadence and top leadership succession plans are reviewed with the Board of Directors annually.
Aptiv is committed to talent development and growing the next generation of leaders. Our established leadership programs provide our leaders with the tools to be effective today while preparing them for future challenges. In 2022, our people completed over 43,000 hours of leadership and management training. Our Global Leadership Development Program develops business acumen and personal competencies, as well as the opportunity to learn and interact with peers from around the world. We also leverage Aptiv Academy, our online learning management system, across the business, using in-person, online and virtual reality learning opportunities.

We are a leader in workplace safety as reflected in our lost time injury frequency rate of 0.143 cases per million hours worked and our lost workday case rate per 100 employees of 0.029 for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our standard safety management system is aligned with ISO 45001 and we are committed to ensuring all of our manufacturing sites are ISO 45001 certified by 2025.
Commitment to Environmental Sustainability
Sustainability has always been core to Aptiv’s business, values and culture. We believe this strong, foundational focus on sustainability makes Aptiv a partner of choice for our customers, a desirable place to work for our employees and a valued contributor to the communities in which we operate. While a key part of our business is to design solutions that help transition the world’s vehicles to cleaner sources of power, we are also committed to reducing our environmental footprint throughout our operations around the globe. We aim to reduce our environmental impact by decreasing our carbon footprint, reducing waste generated and consuming less water in our operations. Expenditures required to meet our environmental sustainability goals, which are described below, are included in our normal budgeting process.
Decreasing our Carbon Footprint
We have committed to becoming carbon-neutral in our global operations by 2030 and to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2040 as we transition away from carbon-intensive energy and processes in our global operations. To achieve these commitments, we are targeting:
•Reducing Scope 1 and 2 absolute CO2e emissions by 25% between the baseline year (2019) and 2025;
•Maintaining annual certification of all major manufacturing sites to the ISO 14001 standard;
•Certifying ten of the most energy-intensive sites to the ISO 50001 certification by 2025;
•Sourcing 100% of electricity for operations from renewable sources by 2030; and
•Delivering only carbon-neutral products by 2039, from sourcing to disposal.
Key to achieving these goals is our global Environmental, Health and Safety and Sustainability management system, which helps to keep us aligned with stringent environmental, health and safety regulations and provides a structure for continuous improvement. This system applies to all Aptiv sites, which means that in some countries our procedures go beyond local regulations and requirements. This system is continuously updated to ensure that our procedures remain up to date.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company. Also refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information in this Annual Report.
Risks Related to Business Environment and Economic Conditions
Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and other supplies that we and our customers use in our products may adversely affect our profitability.
We and our customers use a broad range of materials and supplies, including copper and other metals, petroleum-based resins, chemicals, electronic components and semiconductors. A significant disruption in the supply of these materials for any reason could decrease our production and shipping levels, which could materially increase our operating costs and materially decrease our profit margins.
We, as with other component manufacturers in the automotive industry, ship products to our customers’ vehicle assembly plants throughout the world so they are delivered on a “just-in-time” basis in order to maintain low inventory levels. Our suppliers also use a similar method. However, this “just-in-time” method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and very vulnerable to disruptions.
Such disruptions could be caused by any one of a myriad of potential problems, such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns or failures, electrical outages, fires, explosions or political upheaval, as well as logistical complications due to weather, global climate change, volcanic eruptions, or other natural or nuclear disasters, delayed customs processing, the spread of an infectious disease, virus or other widespread illness and more. Additionally, as we focus operations in best cost countries, the risk for such disruptions is heightened. The lack of any single subcomponent necessary to manufacture one of our products could force us to cease production, potentially for a prolonged period. Similarly, a potential quality issue could force us to halt deliveries while we validate the products. Even where products are ready to be shipped, or have been shipped, delays may arise before they reach our customer. Our customers may halt or delay their production for the same reason if one of their other suppliers fails to deliver necessary components. This may cause our customers, in turn to suspend their orders, or instruct us to suspend delivery, of our products, which may adversely affect our financial performance.
When we fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with our contractual obligations, we generally have to absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the “root cause” problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products. Generally, we must also carry the costs associated with “catching up,” such as overtime and premium freight.
Additionally, if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. These losses and expenses could be significant, and may include consequential losses such as lost profits. Any supply-chain disruption, however small, could potentially cause the complete shutdown of an assembly line of one of our customers, and any such shutdown that is due to causes that are within our control could expose us to material claims of compensation. Where a customer halts production because of another supplier failing to deliver on time, there can be no assurance we will be fully compensated, if at all.
Due to various factors that are beyond our control, there are currently global supply chain disruptions, including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. The semiconductor supply shortage, due in part to increased demand across multiple industries, is impacting production in automotive and other industries. We anticipate these supply chain disruptions will persist in 2023. We, along with most automotive component manufacturers that use semiconductors, have been unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of OEMs because of events which are outside our control, including but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, fires in our suppliers’ facilities, unprecedented weather events in the southwestern United States, and other extraordinary events. Although we are working closely with suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts of these events, some of our customers have indicated that they expect us to bear at least some responsibility for their lost production and other costs. While no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of these customer expectations or any other future claims, we do not currently believe a loss is probable. We will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of these supply chain disruptions, and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize their impact on our business.
In addition, we are carrying critical inventory items and key components, and we continue to procure productive, raw material and non-critical inventory components in order to satisfy our customers’ vehicle production schedules. However, as a result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations, our balance of productive, raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. We will continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including its variants, and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.
The global spread of COVID-19, which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility in global financial markets in 2020 with various adverse impacts continuing to date.
The direct adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aptiv, which primarily affected us in the first half of 2020, included extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers, decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules, disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts, particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all non-essential activities, initially in the first quarter of 2020 in China and subsequently in Europe, North America and South America. During the second half of 2020, many of these impacts abated, resulting in increased sales and profitability from the levels observed earlier in 2020. In 2021, our manufacturing facilities were not impacted by prolonged shutdowns directly resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beginning late in the first quarter of 2022 and continuing into the second quarter, various regions in China, including regions where Aptiv has operations, were subjected to lockdowns imposed by governmental authorities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In response, our manufacturing facilities located in these areas implemented measures designed to minimize the impacts of any shutdowns. Despite these measures, industry-wide production interruptions adversely impacted our sales and profitability beginning at the end of the first quarter and continuing throughout much of the second quarter. Most of the lockdowns were eased in China late in the second quarter, however many lockdowns were re-imposed and production was once again adversely impacted for portions of the fourth quarter of 2022. Estimated total indirect and direct adverse impacts to revenue as a result of these lockdowns during 2022 was approximately $270 million. The overall duration and impact, as well as possible reoccurrence, of these lockdowns in China or other regions, or other measures aimed at containing and mitigating the effects of the pandemic, including renewed travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing orders, “lockdown” orders and shutdowns of non-essential activities, remain uncertain and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods. Other than these production interruptions in China, our manufacturing facilities were not impacted by prolonged shutdowns directly resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022.
Due to the continuing uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic, including potential future governmental actions and economic impacts, it is possible that these adverse impacts could reoccur, resulting in further adverse impacts on our future operating earnings and cash flows. In addition, to the extent the factors indicated above adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors in this section.
The cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business.
Our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive sales and production are highly cyclical and, in addition to general economic conditions, also depend on other factors, such as consumer confidence and consumer preferences. Lower global automotive sales would be expected to result in substantially all of our automotive OEM customers lowering vehicle production schedules, which has a direct impact on our earnings and cash flows. In addition, automotive sales and production can be affected by labor relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements, the availability of consumer financing, inflationary pressures, interest rate volatility, supply chain disruptions and other factors, including global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic declines that result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers have in the past had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our sales are also affected by inventory levels and OEMs’ production levels. We cannot predict when OEMs will decide to increase or decrease inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels. Uncertainty and other unexpected fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
A prolonged economic downturn or economic uncertainty could adversely affect our business and cause us to require additional sources of financing, which may not be available.
Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in the businesses of our customers or potential customers may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Global automotive vehicle production increased 5% (5% on an Aptiv weighted market basis, which represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the Company generates its revenue) from 2021 to 2022, reflecting increased vehicle production of 10% in North America, 3% in China and 8% in South America, our smallest region, and a decrease of 1% in Europe. Uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business. A prolonged downturn in the global or regional automotive industry, or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand, could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges, restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances

against deferred tax assets, which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. If global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases, our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products. If vehicle production were to remain at low levels for an extended period of time or if cash losses for customer defaults rise, our cash flow could be adversely impacted, which could result in our needing to seek additional financing to continue our operations. There can be no assurance that we would be able to secure such financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
A drop in the market share and changes in product mix offered by our customers can impact our revenues.
We are dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers. Our customers generally are OEMs in the automotive industry. This industry is subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, cyclical and short product life cycles, reduced consumer demand patterns and industry consolidation. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products. As a result of changes impacting our customers, sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on our revenues and would include shifts in regional growth, shifts in OEM sales demand, as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration. For instance, a shift in sales demand favoring a particular OEMs’ vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue. A shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions, which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue.
The mix of vehicle offerings by our OEM customers also impacts our sales. A decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business and financial condition. Our sales of products in the regions in which our customers operate also depend on the success of these customers in those regions.
We operate in the highly competitive automotive technology and component supply industry, and are dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for continued growth.
The global automotive technology and component supply industry is highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on price, technology, quality, delivery and overall customer service. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new and disruptive entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry, particularly in countries such as China or in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as automated driving technologies and advanced software. These entrants may seek to gain access to certain vehicle technology and component markets. Any of these new competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance, which could adversely affect the future growth of the Company. Additionally, consolidation in the automotive industry may lead to decreased product purchases from us. As a result, our sales levels and margins could be adversely affected by pricing pressures from OEMs and pricing actions of competitors. These factors led to selective resourcing of business to competitors in the past and may also do so in the future.
In addition, any of our competitors may foresee the course of market development more accurately than us, develop products that are superior to our products, have the ability to produce similar products at a lower cost than us, adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements or develop or introduce new products or solutions before we do, particularly related to potential transformative technologies such as autonomous driving solutions. As a result, our products may not be able to compete successfully with their products. These trends may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products. If we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products that capitalize upon new technologies, this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.
If we do not respond appropriately, the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect our business.
The automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially-viable, fully automated driving experience. The high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us. There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car- and ride-sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. These evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry. If we do not continue to respond quickly and effectively to this evolutionary process our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

We have invested substantial resources in markets and technologies where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter our strategies should such expectations not be realized.
Our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development and manufacturing capacity in geographic areas where we can support our customer base and in product areas of evolving vehicle technologies. We have identified the Asia Pacific region, and more specifically China, as a key geographic market, and have identified intelligent systems software, advanced driver assistance systems, autonomous driving technologies, mobility solutions and high voltage electrification systems as key product markets. We believe these markets are likely to experience substantial long-term growth, and accordingly have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments, both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint ventures, in numerous manufacturing operations, technical centers, research and development activities and other infrastructure to support anticipated growth in these areas. If we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer relationships in the Asia Pacific region, or if we are unable to develop and introduce market-relevant advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving technologies, we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments, but we may incur losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets or product categories, potentially resulting in lost market share to our competitors. Our results will also suffer if these areas do not grow as quickly as we anticipate.
We may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in regulations, technology and technological risks, and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products.
Changes in legislative, regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis are significant factors in our ability to remain competitive and to maintain or increase our revenues. For example, the evolving sector of automated driver assistance and autonomous driving technologies has led to guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regarding best practices for the testing and deployment of automated driving systems, and outlining federal and state roles in the regulation of these systems, including providing state legislatures with best practices on how to safely foster the development and introduction of automated driving technologies onto public roads. There remains potential for the continued introduction of new and expanded regulations in this space, including potential requirements for autonomous vehicle systems to receive approval from the DOT or other regulatory agencies prior to commercial introduction. It is also possible that regulations in this space may diverge among jurisdictions, leading to increased compliance costs.
We cannot provide assurance that certain of our products will not become obsolete or that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive and maintain or increase our revenues in the future. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development or production and failure of products to operate properly. The pace of our development and introduction of new and improved products depends on our ability to implement improved technological innovations in design, engineering and manufacturing, which requires extensive capital investment. Any capital expenditure cuts in these areas that we may determine to implement in the future to reduce costs and conserve cash could reduce our ability to develop and implement improved technological innovations, which may materially reduce demand for our products.
To compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry, we must be able to launch new products to meet changing consumer preferences and our customers’ demand in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our ability to respond to competitive pressures and react quickly to other major changes in the marketplace, including the potential introduction of disruptive technologies such as autonomous driving solutions or consumer desire for and availability of vehicles with advanced driver assistance technologies or which use alternative fuels is also a risk to our future financial performance.
We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new product programs in time for the start of production, or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production under new product programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. Development and manufacturing schedules are difficult to predict, and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs, for which we might supply products. Our failure to successfully launch new products, or a failure by our customers to successfully launch new programs, could adversely affect our results.
Certain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third-parties for development of certain products and potential products, and such collaborative partners or other third-parties could fail to perform sufficiently.
We believe that for certain of our businesses, success in developing market-relevant products depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. In particular, Motional is dependent on the success of our relationship with Hyundai, our joint venture partner. There are certain risks involved in such relationships, as our collaborative partners may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; may be acquired by other

19

Table of Contents

companies and subsequently terminate our collaborative arrangement; may compete with us; may not agree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; or may not agree to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms. Because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. If we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or may need to cancel certain development programs, which could adversely affect our business and operational results.
Declines in the market share or business of our five largest customers may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.
Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 39% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, our revenues may be adversely affected by decreases in any of their businesses or market share. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic and the worldwide semiconductor shortage have adversely impacted the automotive industry in recent years resulting in reduced vehicle production schedules and sales from historical levels, which adversely impacted our financial condition, operating results and cash flows for portions of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Furthermore, because our customers typically have no obligation to purchase a specific quantity of parts, a decline in the production levels of any of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier, could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions.
Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. The automotive technology and components market in China is highly competitive, with competition from many of the largest global manufacturers and numerous smaller domestic manufacturers. As the size of the Chinese market continues to increase over the long-term, we anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, will seek to enter the Chinese market and that existing market participants will act aggressively to increase their market share. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. Additionally, there have been periods of increased market volatility and moderations in the level of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously experienced. Our business in China is sensitive to economic and market conditions that drive automotive sales volumes in China and may be impacted if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China. For example, in 2022, various regions in China, including regions where Aptiv has operations, were subjected to lockdowns imposed by governmental authorities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, which resulted in industry-wide production interruptions during portions of the year. Estimated total indirect and direct adverse impacts to revenue as a result of these lockdowns during 2022 was approximately $270 million. If we are unable to maintain our position in the Chinese market or if vehicle sales in China continue to experience minimal growth or decrease, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.
We may not realize sales represented by awarded business.
We estimate awarded business using certain assumptions, including projected future sales volumes. Our customers generally do not guarantee volumes. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty. Therefore, our actual sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales, are not committed. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of our awarded business, we could realize substantially less revenue over the life of these projects than the currently projected estimate.
Continued pricing pressures, OEM cost reduction initiatives and the ability of OEMs to re-source or cancel vehicle programs may result in lower than anticipated margins, or losses, which may have a significant negative impact on our business.
Cost-cutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing. Our customer supply agreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the period of production, typically one to three percent per year. In addition, our customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience, which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions. OEMs have also possessed significant leverage over their suppliers, including us, because the automotive technology and component supply industry is highly competitive, serves a limited number of customers, has a high fixed cost base and historically has had excess capacity. Based on these factors, and the fact that our customers’ product programs typically last a number of years and are anticipated to encompass large volumes, our customers are able to negotiate favorable pricing. Accordingly, as a Tier I supplier, we are subject to substantial continuing pressure from OEMs to reduce the price of our products. For example, our customer supply agreements generally provide for annual reductions in pricing of our products over the period of production. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as OEMs pursue restructuring and cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions, our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected. See Item 1. Supply Relationships with Our Customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers.

20

Table of Contents

Our supply agreements with our OEM customers are generally requirements contracts, and a decline in the production requirements of any of our customers, and in particular our largest customers, could adversely impact our revenues and profitability.
We receive OEM purchase orders for specific components supplied for particular vehicles. In most instances our OEM customers agree to purchase their requirements for specific products but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. The contracts we have entered into with most of our customers have terms ranging from one year to the life of the model (usually three to seven years, although customers often reserve the right to terminate for convenience). Therefore, a significant decrease in demand for certain key models or group of related models sold by any of our major customers or the ability of a manufacturer to re-source and discontinue purchasing from us, for a particular model or group of models, could have a material adverse effect on us. To the extent that we do not maintain our existing level of business with our largest customers because of a decline in their production requirements or because the contracts expire or are terminated for convenience, we will need to attract new customers or win new business with existing customers, or our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected. See Item 1. Supply Relationships with Our Customers for a detailed discussion of our supply agreements with our customers.
Adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability.
Any significant disruption in our supplier relationships, particularly relationships with sole-source suppliers, could harm our profitability. Furthermore, some of our suppliers may not be able to handle commodity cost volatility and/or sharply changing volumes while still performing as we expect. To the extent our suppliers experience supply disruptions, there is a risk for delivery delays, production delays, production issues or delivery of non-conforming products by our suppliers. Even where these risks do not materialize, we may incur costs as we try to make contingency plans for such risks.
The loss of business with respect to, or the lack of commercial success of, a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance.
Although we receive purchase orders from our customers, these purchase orders generally provide for the supply of a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant, rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products. The loss of business with respect to, or the lack of commercial success of, a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and thereby adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
Increases in costs of the materials and other supplies that we use in our products may have a negative impact on our business.
Significant changes in the markets where we purchase materials, components and supplies for the production of our products may adversely affect our profitability, particularly in the event of significant increases in demand where there is not a corresponding increase in supply, inflation or other pricing increases. In recent periods there have been significant fluctuations in the global prices of copper, petroleum-based resin products, semiconductors and fuel charges, which have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We will continue efforts to pass some supply and material cost increases onto our customers, although competitive and market pressures have limited our ability to do that, particularly with U.S. OEMs, and may prevent us from doing so in the future, because our customers are generally not obligated to accept price increases that we may desire to pass along to them. Even where we are able to pass price increases through to the customer, in some cases there is a lapse of time before we are able to do so. The inability to pass on price increases to our customers when raw material prices increase rapidly or to significantly higher than historic levels could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flow, possibly resulting in lower operating income and profitability. We expect to be continually challenged as demand for our principal raw materials and other supplies, including electronic components, is significantly impacted by demand in key growth markets, particularly in China. We cannot provide assurance that fluctuations in commodity prices will not otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual results of operations.
Our hedging activities to address commodity price fluctuations may not be successful in offsetting future increases in those costs or may reduce or eliminate the benefits of any decreases in those costs.
In order to mitigate short-term volatility in operating results due to the aforementioned commodity price fluctuations, we hedge a portion of near-term exposure to certain raw materials used in production. The results of our hedging practice could be positive, neutral or negative in any period depending on price changes in the hedged exposures. Our hedging activities are not designed to mitigate long-term commodity price fluctuations and, therefore, will not protect from long-term commodity price increases. Our future hedging positions may not correlate to actual raw material costs, which could cause acceleration in the recognition of unrealized gains and losses on hedging positions in operating results.

We may encounter manufacturing challenges.
The volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to: variation in demand for our customers’ products; our customers’ attempts to manage their inventory; design changes; changes in our customers’ manufacturing strategy; our customers’ production schedules; acquisitions of or consolidations among customers; and disruptions in the supply of raw materials or other supplies used in our customers’ products. Due in part to these factors, many of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules. Our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty makes it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity.
We rely on third-party suppliers for components used in our products, and we rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain of our assemblies and finished products. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected if our third-party suppliers lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in their financial or business condition. If our third-party manufacturers fail to deliver products, parts and components of sufficient quality on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged.
From time to time, we have underutilized our manufacturing lines. This excess capacity means we incur increased fixed costs in our products relative to the net revenue we generate, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during economic downturns. If we are unable to improve utilization levels for these manufacturing lines and correctly manage capacity, the increased expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of our manufacturing lines are located in China or other countries that are subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including increasing labor costs, which may result from market demand or other factors, and political, social and economic instability.
Changes in factors that impact the determination of our non-U.S. pension liabilities may adversely affect us.
Certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans, which generally provide benefits based on negotiated amounts for each year of service. Our primary funded non-U.S. plans are located in Mexico and the United Kingdom and were underfunded by $73 million as of December 31, 2022. The funding requirements of these benefit plans, and the related expense reflected in our financial statements, are affected by several factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and volatility, including governmental regulation. In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, we have retirement obligations driven by requirements in many of the countries in which we operate. These legally required plans require payments at the time benefits are due. Obligations, net of plan assets, related to these non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and statutorily required retirement obligations totaled $344 million at December 31, 2022, of which $18 million is included in accrued liabilities, $351 million is included in long-term liabilities and $25 million is included in long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations and the cost of providing such benefits, funding requirements and expense recognition include the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on pension assets. If the actual trends in these factors are less favorable than our assumptions, this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We may suffer future asset impairment and other restructuring charges, including write downs of long-lived assets, goodwill, or intangible assets.
We have taken, are taking, and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure to meet current and projected operational and market requirements. Charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring actions will be completed as planned or achieve the desired results.
Additionally, from time to time, we have recorded asset impairment losses relating to specific plants and operations. Generally, we record asset impairment losses when we determine that our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows from an operation will not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of that facility’s building, fixed assets and production tooling. For goodwill, we perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s value is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not met, the Company then performs a quantitative assessment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company recognizes an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. It is possible that we could incur such charges in the future as changes in economic or operating conditions impacting the estimates and assumptions could result in additional impairment.
Employee strikes and labor-related disruptions involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our operations.
Our business is labor-intensive and we have a number of unions, works councils and other represented employees. A strike or other form of significant work disruption by our employees would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. A labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect

22

Table of Contents

our operations could reduce our sales and harm our profitability. A labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or a closure of our customers’ assembly plants where our products are included in the assembled parts or vehicles could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability. In addition, our inability or the inability of any of our customers, our suppliers or our customers’ suppliers to negotiate an extension of a collective bargaining agreement upon its expiration could reduce our sales and harm our profitability. Significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also adversely affect our business and harm our profitability.
We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations as a result of our substantial global operations, which may affect our financial results.
We have currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. Approximately 64% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 came from sales outside the U.S., which were primarily invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and we expect net revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro and Chinese Yuan (Renminbi), could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our margins. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also disrupt the business of our suppliers by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance.
Historically, we have reduced our currency exposure by aligning our costs in the same currency as our revenues or, if that is impracticable, through financial instruments that provide offsets or limits to our exposures, which are opposite to the underlying transactions. However, any measures that we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies and other risks of our global operations may not be effective.
We face risks associated with doing business in various national and local jurisdictions.
The majority of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are in Mexico, China and other countries in Asia Pacific, Eastern and Western Europe, South America and Northern Africa. We also purchase raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 64% of our net revenue came from sales outside the U.S. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business globally, including:
•exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions;
•unexpected changes in laws, regulations, economic and trade sanctions, trade or monetary or fiscal policy, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the U.S. and other countries;
•tariffs, quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers;
•expropriation and nationalization;
•difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through certain non-U.S. legal systems;
•reduced technology, data or intellectual property protections;
•limitations on repatriation of earnings;
•withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;
•investment restrictions or requirements;
•violence and civil unrest in local countries, including the conflict between Ukraine and Russia; and
•compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of various other countries.
Additionally, our global operations may also be adversely affected by political events, terrorist events and hostilities, complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters or the spread of an infectious disease, virus or other widespread illness. For instance, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia caused the U.S., European Union and other nations to implement broad economic sanctions against Russia. These countries may impose further sanctions and take other actions as the situation continues. While the sanctions announced to date have not had a material adverse impact on us, any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by these countries, and any retaliatory measures by Russia in response, including restrictions on energy supplies from Russia to countries in the region and asset expropriations, could increase our costs, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.
Ukraine and Russia are significant global producers of raw materials used in our supply chain, including copper, aluminum, palladium and neon gases. Disruptions in the supply and volatility in the price of these materials and other inputs produced by Ukraine or Russia, including increased logistics costs and longer transit times, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, in July 2022, the E.U. introduced an emergency natural gas rationing plan to reduce the

23

Table of Contents

use of natural gas by businesses and in public buildings in E.U. member states from August 2022 through March 2023 in order to replenish gas reserves. Among other impacts, this may cause widespread economic disruptions during this time period, including potential shutdowns at our suppliers’ or customers’ facilities in the region. The conflict has also increased the possibility of cyberattacks occurring, which could either directly or indirectly impact our operations.
We do not have a material physical presence in either Ukraine or Russia, with less than 1% of our workforce located in the countries as of December 31, 2022 and less than 1% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 generated from manufacturing facilities in those countries. However, the impacts of the conflict have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, global economies, and in particular, the European economy, a region which accounted for approximately 31% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022.
We continue to monitor the situation and will seek to minimize its impact to our business, while prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees located in both countries and our compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the locations where we operate. Any of the impacts mentioned above, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
In addition, the global spread of COVID-19, which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, caused certain governmental authorities worldwide to initiate “lockdown” orders for all non-essential activities, which at times, included extended shutdowns of businesses in the impacted regions. This includes the lockdowns in China that occurred in 2022, as discussed further above. This or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in China or Mexico and other countries in which we operate could result in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our results of operations and financial condition.
Existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. government imposed additional export control restrictions targeting the export, re-export or transfer of, among other products, certain advanced computing semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing items and related technology to China, which could further disrupt supply chains and adversely impact our business. Furthermore, management continues to monitor the volatile geopolitical environment to identify, quantify and assess threatened duties, taxes or other business restrictions which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Increasing our manufacturing footprint in Asian markets, including China, and our business relationships with Asian automotive manufacturers are important elements of our long-term strategy. In addition, our strategy includes increasing revenue and expanding our manufacturing footprint in lower-cost regions. As a result, our exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential impact on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable.
If we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures, acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business, our business could be materially adversely harmed. In addition, the failure to realize the expected benefits of any past or future acquisition could adversely affect our business.
We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, including the acquisitions of Wind River and Intercable Automotive Solutions S.r.l. in 2022. We expect to continue to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances that leverage our technology capabilities and enhance our customer base, geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses and we regularly evaluate potential opportunities, some of which could be material. While we believe that such transactions are an integral part of our long-term strategy, there are risks and uncertainties related to these activities. Assessing a potential growth opportunity involves extensive due diligence. However, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited, and we can give no assurance that new business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned. For instance, our acquisition of Wind River, is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, which may result in the failure to realize the expected benefits of the transaction. We expect Wind River to become a foundational element of executing our business strategy as Wind River’s industry-leading software services are complementary to our existing portfolio of software solutions, advanced compute and smart architectures and we intend to establish Wind River as the cornerstone of our software strategy. If we are not successful in establishing Wind River in this regard, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
Furthermore, we may not be successful in fully or partially integrating companies that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. We may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. If we

24

Table of Contents

fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and operating results could be materially impacted. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies profitably may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Furthermore, if the benefits of an acquisition do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our ordinary shares prior to the closing of the acquisition may decline.
Digital technologies are increasingly crucial to our products and our business. Any significant disruptions such as disruptions caused by cyber-attacks to our information technology capabilities, or those of third parties with which we do business, could adversely impact our business. Similarly, as mobility becomes increasingly connected, electric and autonomous, vehicles increasingly depend on the proper functioning of their software and micro-electronics.
Our ability to keep our business operating effectively depends on the functional and efficient operation of information technology capabilities, both internally and externally. Our capabilities, as well as those of our customers, suppliers, partners and service providers, are crucial to operations and contain confidential personal information, business-related information or intellectual property. These capabilities are also susceptible to interruptions (including those caused by systems failures, cyber-attacks and other natural or man-made incidents or disasters), which may be prolonged or go undetected. Cyber-attacks are continually increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Although we have and continue to employ capabilities, processes and other security and privacy measures designed to prevent, detect and mitigate the risk of such events, including but not limited to geographically diverse and resilient infrastructure, third-party risk management and the implementation of proactive security and privacy measures, a significant or large-scale interruption of our information technology capabilities could result in a confidentiality, integrity or availability data breach, and adversely affect our ability to manage and keep operations running efficiently and effectively, and could result in significant costs, regulatory investigations, fines or litigation. Incidents that result in a wider or sustained disruption to our business or products, or result in a personal data breach, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of our employees work from home on a full-time or part-time basis, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber and other information technology risks.
Some of our products, including but not limited to safety-critical products, contain complex digital technologies designed to support today’s increasingly connected vehicles. Although we continue to employ capabilities, processes and other security and privacy measures designed to reduce risks of cyber-attacks against our products, such measures may not provide absolute security (and, in turn, privacy) and may not sufficiently mitigate all potential risks under all scenarios. Failure of such products to effectively protect against attacks targeted at our products can negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, customers, financial condition and operating results.
Further, engineering and maintaining security for our systems and products may require significant costs. However, failing to properly respond to and invest in information technology and cybersecurity advancements may limit our ability to attract and retain customers, prevent us from offering similar products and services as those offered by our competitors or inhibit our ability to meet regulatory, industry or other compliance requirements.
To date, we have not experienced a system failure, cyber-attack or security breach that has resulted in a material interruption in our operations or material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our Board of Directors regularly reviews relevant information technology and cybersecurity matters and receives periodic updates from information technology and cybersecurity subject matter experts as part of its risk assessment procedures, including analysis of existing and emerging risks, as well as plans and strategies to address those risks. While we continuously seek to expand and improve our information technology systems and maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures, there can be no assurance that we can adequately anticipate all trends of the market, technology landscapes, and threat landscapes, and there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business.
Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory, Tax and Accounting Matters
We may incur material losses and costs as a result of warranty claims, product recalls, product liability and intellectual property infringement actions that may be brought against us.
We face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and, in the case of product liability, such failure of our products results in bodily injury and/or property damage. The fabrication of the products we manufacture is a complex and precise process. Our customers specify quality, performance and reliability standards. If flaws in either the design or manufacture of our products were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that could result in significant delays in shipment and product re-work or replacement costs. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, these may not be sufficient to avoid product failures, which could cause us to:

25

Table of Contents

•lose net revenue;
•incur increased costs such as warranty expense and costs associated with customer support;
•experience delays, cancellations or rescheduling of orders for our products;
•experience increased product returns or discounts; or
•damage our reputation,
all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products. Each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers. However, as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, OEMs continue to look to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims. A recall claim brought against us, or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance, may have a material adverse effect on our business. OEMs also require their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. Depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer, a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of products under new vehicle warranties when the OEM asserts that the product supplied did not perform as warranted. Although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material, we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements. Our warranty reserves are based on our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims. We regularly evaluate the level of these reserves and adjust them when appropriate. However, the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates.
In addition, as we adopt new technology, we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights. We cannot ensure that we will not experience any material warranty, product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims.
We may be adversely affected by laws or regulations, including environmental, health and safety and climate change, regulation, litigation or other liabilities.
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S., laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, health and safety, financial and other matters.
We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretations thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
We are subject to laws and regulations governing, among other things:
•the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, presence of, or exposure to hazardous materials;
•the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water;
•climate change;
•the incorporation of certain chemical substances into our products, including electronic equipment; and
•the health and safety of our employees.
We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.
Certain environmental laws impose liability, sometimes regardless of fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from our currently or formerly owned, leased or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Some of these environmental laws may also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to third-party disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of present and former facilities. The ultimate cost to us of site cleanups is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the potential for ongoing environmental monitoring and maintenance that could be required for many years, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, alternative cleanup methods, and potential agreements that could be reached with governmental and third parties. While we have environmental reserves of approximately $2 million at December 31, 2022 for the cleanup of presently-known

26

Table of Contents

environmental contamination conditions, it cannot be guaranteed that actual costs will not significantly exceed these reserves. We also could be named as a potentially responsible party at additional sites in the future and the costs associated with such future sites may be material.
Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Specifically, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may continue to result in more international, regional, federal, state and local requirements, or pressure from key stakeholders, to reduce or mitigate climate change, which could impose significant operational restrictions, costs and compliance burdens upon our business or our products. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations, we cannot ensure that environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent in the future. Therefore, we cannot ensure that our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, adoption of GHG or climate change rules in jurisdictions in which we operate facilities could require installation of emission controls, acquisition of emission credits, emission reductions, or other measures that could be costly, and could also impact utility rates and increase the amount we spend annually for energy. Furthermore, if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals and reduce our impact on the environment, or if there becomes a public perception that we have failed to act responsibly regarding climate change and sustainability, we could be exposed to negative publicity, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.
We may identify the need for additional environmental remediation or demolition obligations relating to facility divestiture, closure and decommissioning activities.
As we sell, close and/or demolish facilities around the world, environmental investigations and assessments will need to be performed. We may identify previously unknown environmental conditions or further delineate known conditions that may require remediation or incur additional costs related to demolition or decommissioning activities, such as abatement of asbestos containing materials or removal of storage tanks. Such costs could exceed our reserves.
We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position.
We are involved in legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers; intellectual property matters; personal injury claims; environmental, health and safety issues; tax matters; and employment matters.
While we believe our reserves are adequate, the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates and our results of operations could be materially affected.
For further information regarding our legal matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings. No assurance can be given that such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position.
Developments or assertions by us or against us relating to intellectual property rights could materially impact our business.
We own significant intellectual property, including a large number of patents and trade names, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business. Significant technological developments by others also could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial condition.
Taxing authorities could challenge our historical and future tax positions.
Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates and changes in tax laws or their interpretation including changes related to tax holidays or tax incentives. Our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or if tax rates or regimes applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased. Existing income tax laws, regulations and related international agreements provide guidance and direction on the allocations of income and applicable taxing rights among the countries in which we operate. Changes in these guidelines are being contemplated at the local, national, regional (particularly in the European Union), and global levels (through organizations like the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). Any changes, especially if made inconsistently, could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results.
The amount of tax we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. We have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws. Additionally, in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of a tax examination, our

27

Table of Contents

reserves for uncertain tax benefits reflect the outcome of tax positions that are more likely than not to occur. While we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws, there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes. Should additional taxes be assessed, this may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
General Risk Factors
Any changes in consumer credit availability or cost of borrowing could adversely affect our business.
Declines in the availability of consumer credit and increases in consumer borrowing costs have negatively impacted global automotive sales and resulted in lower production volumes in the past. Substantial declines in automotive sales and production by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We may lose or fail to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel.
An important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key salaried employees and management personnel. Our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and the competitive market position of our overall compensation package. We may not be as successful as competitors at recruiting, assimilating and retaining highly skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key salaried employee could have an adverse effect on our business.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
We have no unresolved SEC staff comments to report.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
As of December 31, 2022, we owned or leased 131 major manufacturing sites and 11 major technical centers. A manufacturing site may include multiple plants and may be wholly or partially owned or leased. We also have many smaller manufacturing sites, sales offices, warehouses, engineering centers, joint ventures and other investments strategically located throughout the world. We have a presence in 48 countries. The following table shows the regional distribution of our major manufacturing sites by the operating segment that uses such facilities:

----------------------------------- ------------- -------------------------- -- ------------ ------------- ----- - ---
 North America Europe,Middle East& Africa Asia Pacific South America Total
Signal and Power Solutions 45 37 33 5 120

Advanced Safety and User Experience 2 5 4 — 11
Total 47 42 37 5 131

In addition to these manufacturing sites, we had 11 major technical centers: four in North America; two in Europe, Middle East and Africa; and five in Asia Pacific.
Of our 131 major manufacturing sites and 11 major technical centers, which include facilities owned or leased by our consolidated subsidiaries, 65 are primarily owned and 77 are primarily leased.
We frequently review our real estate portfolio and develop footprint strategies to support our customers’ global plans, while at the same time supporting our technical needs and controlling operating expenses. We believe our evolving portfolio will meet current and anticipated future needs.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are from time to time subject to various actions, claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings incidental to our business, including those arising out of alleged defects, breach of contracts, competition and antitrust matters, product warranties, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims and employment-related matters. It is our opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. With respect to warranty matters, although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by customers will not be material, we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements. However, the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates.

Brazil Matters
Aptiv conducts business operations in Brazil that are subject to the Brazilian federal labor, social security, environmental, health and safety, tax and customs laws, as well as a variety of state and local laws. While Aptiv believes it complies with such laws, they are complex, subject to varying interpretations, and the Company is often engaged in litigation with government agencies regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances. As of December 31, 2022, the majority of claims asserted against Aptiv in Brazil relate to such litigation. The remaining claims in Brazil relate to commercial and labor litigation with private parties. As of December 31, 2022, claims totaling approximately $105 million (using December 31, 2022 foreign currency rates) have been asserted against Aptiv in Brazil. As of December 31, 2022, the Company maintains accruals for these asserted claims of $5 million (using December 31, 2022 foreign currency rates). The amounts accrued represent claims that are deemed probable of loss and are reasonably estimable based on the Company’s analyses and assessment of the asserted claims and prior experience with similar matters. While the Company believes its accruals are adequate, the final amounts required to resolve these matters could differ materially from the Company’s recorded estimates and Aptiv’s results of operations could be materially affected. The Company estimates the reasonably possible loss in excess of the amounts accrued related to these claims to be zero to $40 million.

As part of our strategy to harness the full potential of connected intelligent systems across industries, strengthen our capabilities in software-defined mobility and to enable advanced smart vehicle architecture changes, we acquired Wind River Systems, Inc. (“Wind River”) in December 2022. Wind River is a global leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge. Previously, in 2021, we executed a strategic collaboration agreement with Wind River to develop a software toolchain for various automotive applications.
We are also continuing to invest in the automated driving space, and have continued to develop market-leading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software, key active safety sensing technologies and our multi-domain controller, which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions. We believe we are well-aligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space, and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies.
In March 2020, to further our leadership position in the automated driving space, we completed a transaction with Hyundai Motor Group to form Motional, AD LLC (“Motional”), a joint venture focused on the design, development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies. Motional brings together one of the industry’s most innovative vehicle technology providers with one of the world’s largest OEMs. We expect this partnership to accelerate the path towards the development of production-ready autonomous driving systems for commercialization in the new mobility space.
We believe that substantial strategic value will be created from our partnership with Hyundai through our commitment to a shared mission of making driverless vehicles a safe, reliable, and accessible reality. Furthermore, we anticipate Motional’s presence in both North America and Asia, along with the global presence of both Aptiv and Hyundai, to generate economies of scale to support the development of a complete autonomous driving platform, as well as to facilitate mobility infrastructure advancements.
Motional began testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and began testing a production-ready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers, meal delivery providers, fleet operators and automotive manufacturers at prototype scale in 2022, with higher volume production deployments anticipated in late 2023. In addition, Motional is involved in collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as Boston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Singapore as solutions are developed for the evolving nature of the mobility industry.
As a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships, we believe we are well-aligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas. However, there are many risks associated with these evolving areas, including the high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving technologies, the uncertain timing of customer and consumer adoption of these technologies, increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry and evolving regulations, such as the guidance for automated driving systems published by the U.S. Department of Transportation. While we believe we are well-positioned in these markets, the high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us or our partners and ultimately there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to develop these technologies.
Leveraging our engineering and technological capabilities. We seek to leverage our strong product portfolio tied to the industry’s key mega-trends with our global footprint to increase our revenues, as well as committing to substantial annual investment in research and development to maintain and enhance our leadership in new mobility solutions across each of our product lines.
Targeting the right business with the right customers. We intend to be strategic in our pursuit of new business and customers in order to achieve disciplined, above-market growth. We conduct in-depth analysis of market share and product trends by region in order to prioritize research, development and engineering spend for the customers that we believe will be successful. Collaboration with customers in our 11 major technical centers around the world helps us develop innovative product solutions designed to meet their needs. As more OEMs design vehicles for global platforms, where the same vehicle architecture is shared among different regions, we are well suited to provide global design and engineering support while manufacturing these products for a specific regional market.
Capitalizing on our scale, global footprint and established position in key growth markets. We intend to generate sustained growth by capitalizing on the breadth and scale of our operating capabilities. Our global footprint provides us important proximity to our customers’ manufacturing facilities and allows us to serve them in every region in which they operate. We anticipate that we will continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on growing automotive markets, particularly in China. In addition, our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards key growth markets.
Leveraging our lean and flexible cost structure to deliver profitability and cash flow. We recognize the importance of maintaining a lean and flexible cost structure in order to deliver stable earnings and cash flow in a cyclical industry. Our focus

33

is on maximizing and optimizing manufacturing output to meet increasing production requirements with minimal additions to our fixed-cost base. Additionally, we are continuing to use a meaningful amount of temporary workers to ensure we have the appropriate operational flexibility to scale our operations so that we can maintain our profitability as industry production levels increase or contract.
Advancing and maintaining an efficient capital structure. We actively manage our capital structure in order to maintain an investment grade credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support our business and maximize shareholder value. We will continue to make adjustments to our capital structure in light of changes in economic conditions or as opportunities arise to provide us with additional financial flexibility to invest in our business and execute our strategic objectives going forward.
Pursuing selected acquisitions and strategic investments. In 2022, we continued to complete selected acquisitions and strategic investments in order to continue to leverage our technology capabilities and enhance and expand our commercialization of new mobility solutions, product offerings, customer base, geographic penetration and scale to complement our current businesses, while continuing to enhance our product offerings and competitive position in growing market segments.
For example, in December 2022, we acquired Wind River for approximately $3.5 billion. With Aptiv and Wind River’s synergistic technologies and decades of experience delivering safety critical systems, the Company believes this acquisition will accelerate the journey to a software-defined future of the automotive industry. In addition, in March 2022, Aptiv invested $220 million in TTTech Auto AG, a leading provider of safety-critical middleware solutions for advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving applications. Together, these actions accelerate our software strategy, broaden our portfolio of technology solutions and enable us to capitalize on opportunities requiring comprehensive software solutions.
Furthermore, in November 2022, we acquired 85% of Intercable Automotive Solutions S.r.l. for approximately $606 million. As an industry leader in high voltage power distribution and interconnect technology, we expect Intercable Automotive to enhance Aptiv’s position as a leader in vehicle architecture systems.
Accelerating an electric, zero-emissions future. We are committed to becoming carbon-neutral in our global operations by 2030 and to achieving net carbon neutrality by 2040 as we transition away from carbon-intensive energy and processes in our global operations. We also continue to focus on minimizing the overall environmental impact of vehicles as a key part of our overall business strategy. We believe that this strong, foundational focus on sustainability makes Aptiv a partner of choice for our customers, a desirable place to work for our employees and a valued contributor to the communities in which we operate.
Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities
Ukraine/Russia conflict. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia, which began in February 2022, has had, and is expected to continue to have, negative economic impacts to both countries and to the European and global economies. In response to the conflict, the European Union (the “E.U.”), United States (the “U.S.”) and other nations implemented broad economic sanctions against Russia. These countries may impose further sanctions and take other actions as the situation continues.
Given the sanctions put in place by the E.U., U.S. and other governments, which restrict our ability to conduct business in Russia, we initiated a plan to exit our majority owned subsidiary in Russia in the second quarter of 2022. As a result, the Company determined that this subsidiary, which is reported within the Signal and Power Solutions segment, met the held for sale criteria as of December 31, 2022. Consequently, for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $51 million to impair the carrying value of the Russian subsidiary’s net assets to fair value, which was recorded primarily within cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations. Approximately $25 million of these charges were attributable to the noncontrolling interest based on the noncontrolling shareholder’s economic interest. The remaining assets and liabilities, which are de minimis, were reclassified to other current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.
Ukraine and Russia are also significant global producers of raw materials used in our supply chain, including copper, aluminum, palladium and neon gases. Disruptions in the supply and volatility in the price of these materials and other inputs produced by Ukraine or Russia, including increased logistics costs and longer transit times, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, in July 2022, the E.U. introduced an emergency natural gas rationing plan to reduce the use of natural gas by businesses and in public buildings in E.U. member states from August 2022 through March 2023 in order to replenish gas reserves. Among other impacts, this may cause widespread economic disruptions during this time period, including potential shutdowns at our suppliers’ or customers’ facilities in the region. The conflict has also increased the possibility of cyberattacks occurring, which could either directly or indirectly impact our operations. Furthermore, the conflict has caused our customers to analyze their continued presence in the region and future customer production plans in the region remain uncertain.

We do not have a material physical presence in either Ukraine or Russia, with less than 1% of our workforce located in the countries as of December 31, 2022 and less than 1% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 generated from manufacturing facilities in those countries. However, the impacts of the conflict have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, global economies, and in particular, the European economy, a region which accounted for approximately 31% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have incurred costs (including capital expenditures), to relocate production for certain customers out of Ukraine and to duplicate such production in other countries, which we substantially completed in the second quarter of 2022. We have recovered substantially all of the costs related to this relocation from impacted customers as of December 31, 2022. Aggregate costs and recoveries related to this process were not significant for the year ended December 31, 2022. However, the Company recorded asset impairments and other related charges of approximately $8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily for long-lived assets and inventory for certain sites in Ukraine. These charges were primarily recorded within cost of sales in the statement of operations. Furthermore, as a result of the conflict, we estimate that the adverse impacts to revenue from Russia operations were approximately $65 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.
We continue to monitor the situation and will seek to minimize its impact to our business, while prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees located in both countries and our compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the locations where we operate. Any of the impacts mentioned above, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
COVID-19 pandemic. The global spread of COVID-19, which originated in late 2019 and was later declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted supply chains and created significant volatility in global financial markets in 2020 with various adverse impacts continuing to date.
The direct adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Aptiv, which primarily affected us in the first half of 2020, included extended work stoppages and travel restrictions at our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers, decreases in consumer demand and vehicle production schedules, disruptions to our supply chain and other adverse global economic impacts, particularly those resulting from temporary governmental “lockdown” orders for all non-essential activities, initially in the first quarter of 2020 in China and subsequently in Europe, North America and South America. During the second half of 2020, many of these impacts abated, resulting in increased sales and profitability from the levels observed earlier in 2020. In 2021, our manufacturing facilities were not impacted by prolonged shutdowns directly resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beginning late in the first quarter of 2022 and continuing into the second quarter, various regions in China, including regions where Aptiv has operations, were subjected to lockdowns imposed by governmental authorities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. In response, our manufacturing facilities located in these areas implemented measures designed to minimize the impacts of any shutdowns. Despite these measures, industry-wide production interruptions adversely impacted our sales and profitability beginning at the end of the first quarter and continuing throughout much of the second quarter. Most of the lockdowns were eased in China late in the second quarter, however many lockdowns were re-imposed and production was once again adversely impacted for portions of the fourth quarter of 2022. Estimated total indirect and direct adverse impacts to revenue as a result of these lockdowns during 2022 was approximately $270 million. The overall duration and impact, as well as possible reoccurrence, of these lockdowns in China or other regions, or other measures aimed at containing and mitigating the effects of the pandemic, including renewed travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing orders, “lockdown” orders and shutdowns of non-essential activities, remain uncertain and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows in future periods. Other than these production interruptions in China, our manufacturing facilities were not impacted by prolonged shutdowns directly resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022.
Certain direct and indirect adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have persisted to date and are expected to continue in 2023, including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage and global supply chain disruptions. As a result, due to the continuing uncertainties surrounding of the COVID-19 pandemic, including potential future governmental actions and economic impacts, it is possible that these adverse impacts could reoccur, resulting in further adverse impacts on our future operating earnings and cash flows. We will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize their impact on our business.
Global supply chain disruptions. Due to various factors that are beyond our control, there are currently global supply chain disruptions, including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. The semiconductor supply shortage, due in part to increased demand across multiple industries, is impacting production in automotive and other industries. We anticipate these supply chain disruptions will persist in 2023. We, along with most automotive component manufacturers that use semiconductors, have been unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of OEMs because of events which are outside our control, including but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, fires in our suppliers’ facilities, unprecedented weather events in the southwestern United States, and other extraordinary events. Although we are working closely with suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts of these events, some of our customers have indicated that they expect us to bear at least some responsibility for their lost production and other costs. While no assurances can be made as to the ultimate outcome of these customer expectations or any other future claims, we do not

35

currently believe a loss is probable. We will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of these supply chain disruptions, and will seek to aggressively mitigate and minimize their impact on our business.
In addition, we are carrying critical inventory items and key components, and we continue to procure productive, raw material and non-critical inventory components in order to satisfy our customers’ vehicle production schedules. However, as a result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations, our balance of productive, raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. We will continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital.
Economic conditions. Our business is directly related to automotive sales and automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive sales depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions. Global automotive vehicle production increased 5% (5% on an Aptiv weighted market basis, which represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the Company generates its revenue, “AWM”) from 2021 to 2022, reflecting increased vehicle production of 10% in North America, 3% in China and 8% in South America, our smallest region, and a decrease of 1% in Europe. Refer to Note 22. Segment Reporting of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for financial information concerning principal geographic areas.
Economic volatility or weakness in North America, Europe, China or, to a lesser extent, South America, could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2022, global inflationary pressures both reduced consumer demand for automotive vehicles and increased the price of inputs to our products, which has adversely impacted our profitability and this trend is expected to continue in 2023. There is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the U.S. and other economies, and specifically the automotive sector. In particular, changes to international trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement or other political pressures could affect the operations of our OEM customers, resulting in reduced automotive production in certain regions or shifts in the mix of production to higher cost regions. Increases in interest rates could also negatively impact automotive production as a result of increased consumer borrowing costs or reduced credit availability. Additionally, economic weakness may result in shifts in the mix of future automotive sales (from vehicles with more content such as luxury vehicles, trucks and sport utility vehicles toward smaller passenger cars). While our diversified customer and geographic revenue base, along with our flexible cost structure, have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns, shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability.
Key growth markets. There have been periods of increased market volatility and moderation in the level of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously experienced. Automotive production in China experienced growth of 3% in 2022, which follows growth of 2% in 2021. Despite the moderation in the level of economic growth in China, rising income levels in China and other key growth markets are expected to result in stronger growth rates in these markets over the long-term. Our strong global presence, and presence in these markets, has positioned us to experience above-market growth rates over the long-term. We continue to expand our established presence in key growth markets, positioning us to benefit from the expected long-term growth opportunities in these regions. We are capitalizing on our long-standing relationships with the global OEMs and further enhancing our positions with the key growth market OEMs to continue expanding our worldwide leadership. We continue to build upon our extensive geographic reach to capitalize on fast-growing automotive markets. We believe that our presence in best cost countries positions us to realize incremental margin improvements as the global balance of automotive production shifts towards the key growth markets.
We have a strong local presence in China, including a major manufacturing base and well-established customer relationships. Each of our business segments have operations and sales in China. Our business in China remains sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes in China, and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the Chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China, as have recently been experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental lockdowns. However, we continue to believe this market will benefit from long-term demand for new vehicles and stringent governmental regulation driving increased vehicle content, including accelerated demand for electrified vehicles.
Market driven products. Our product offerings satisfy the OEMs’ needs to meet increasingly stringent government regulations and meet consumer preferences for products that address the mega-trends of Safe, Green and Connected, leading to increased content per vehicle, greater profitability and higher margins. With these offerings, we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for vehicle content and technology related to safety, electrification, high speed data, connectivity to the global information network and automated driving technologies. We are benefiting from the substantial increase in vehicle content, software and electrification that requires a complex and reliable electrical architecture and systems to operate, such as automated advanced driver assistance technologies, electrical vehicle monitoring, active safety systems, lane

departure warning systems, integrated vehicle cockpit displays, navigation systems and technologies that enable connected infotainment in vehicles. Our ability to design a reliable electrical architecture that optimizes power distribution and/or consumption is key to satisfying the OEMs’ needs to reduce emissions while continuing to meet consumer demand for increased vehicle content and technology.
Global capabilities. Many OEMs are continuing to adopt global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEMs are selecting suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis, as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, are best positioned to benefit from this trend. Our global footprint enables us to serve the global OEMs on a worldwide basis as we gain market share with key growth market OEMs. This regional model is structured primarily to service the North American market from Mexico, the South American market from Brazil, the European market from Eastern Europe and North Africa, and the Asia Pacific market from China, and we have continued to rotate our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations within these regions.
Our operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business globally, including military conflicts in regions in which we operate, unexpected changes in laws or regulations governing trade, or other monetary or tax fiscal policy changes, including tariffs, quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions or trade barriers. We are also subject to risks associated with actions taken by governmental authorities to impose changes in laws or regulations that restrict certain business operations, trade or travel in response to a pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness. For instance, as described above, the conflict between Ukraine and Russia has created numerous economic uncertainties, including the potential for further sanctions against Russia, the impact on the global supply chain for raw materials produced in each country, as well as increased logistics costs and transit times, the impact of the E.U. natural gas rationing plan and the actions of automotive OEMs and suppliers as they relate to production plans in each country. The impacts of any of these factors mentioned above, among others, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
 In addition, the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and variants thereof in recent years, has had various direct and indirect adverse impacts on our global operations, the automotive industry and economies around the world. Although certain of the adverse impacts of the pandemic abated during the second half of 2020, other direct and indirect adverse impacts continued throughout 2021 and 2022, such as the overall supply chain disruptions, including the global semiconductor supply shortage and the regional lockdowns imposed by governmental authorities in China during portions of 2022. These impacts continue to negatively affect the global economy and automotive industry, and we anticipate that certain impacts will persist in 2023. As a result, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact to our business due to a number of evolving factors, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on economic activity, our supply chain, consumer demand and vehicle production schedules, and the actions of governmental authorities across the globe.
Furthermore, existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. government imposed additional export control restrictions targeting the export, re-export or transfer of, among other products, certain advanced computing semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing items and related technology to China, which could further disrupt supply chains and adversely impact our business. Furthermore, management continues to monitor the volatile geopolitical environment to identify, quantify and assess threatened duties, taxes or other business restrictions which could adversely affect our business and financial results.
Product development. The automotive technology and components industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost competitive basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. To compete effectively in the automotive technology and components industry, we must be able to develop and launch new products to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner. Our innovative technologies and robust global engineering and development capabilities have us well positioned to meet the increasingly stringent vehicle manufacturer demands and consumer preferences for high-technology content in automobiles.
OEMs are increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs and weight. As a result, suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers (Tier I suppliers) have assumed many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers. Suppliers that can provide fully-engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing.

Engineering, design and development. Our history and culture of innovation have enabled us to develop significant intellectual property and design and development expertise to provide advanced technology solutions that meet the demands of our customers. We have a team of approximately 22,000 scientists, engineers and technicians focused on developing leading product solutions for our key markets, located at 11 major technical centers in China, Germany, India, Mexico, Poland, Singapore and the United States. Our total investment in research and development, including engineering, was approximately $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which includes approximately $379 million, $320 million and $303 million of co-investment by customers and government agencies. Each year we share some engineering expenses with OEMs and government agencies which generally ranges from 20% to 30% of engineering expenses. This level of co-investment supports product development, accelerates the pace of innovation and reduces the risk associated with successful commercialization of technological breakthroughs. We also encourage “open innovation” and collaborate extensively with peers in the industry, government agencies and academic institutions.
In the past, suppliers often incurred the initial cost of engineering, designing and developing automotive component parts, and recovered their investments over time by including a cost recovery component in the price of each part based on expected volumes. Recently, we and many other suppliers have negotiated for cost recovery payments independent of volumes. This trend reduces our economic risk.
We utilize a Technology Advisory Council, a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders, which helps us anticipate cutting-edge technology trends and guides our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth and foster innovation. This independent perspective assists Aptiv in pursuing investments in the right technologies that create the most value for all of its stakeholders. We believe that our engineering and technical expertise, together with our emphasis on continuing research and development, allow us to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for our customers and to bring new, innovative products to market. We believe that continued engineering activities are critical to maintaining our pipeline of technologically advanced products. Given our strong financial discipline, we seek to effectively manage fixed costs and efficiently rationalize capital spending by critically evaluating the profit potential of new and existing customer programs, including investment in innovation and technology. We maintain our engineering activities around our focused product portfolio and allocate our capital and resources to those products with distinctive technologies. We expect expenditures for research and development activities, including engineering, net of co-investment, to be approximately $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, which includes increased expenditures as a result of our acquisition of Wind River.
We maintain a large portfolio of approximately 9,500 patents and protective rights in the operation of our business as of December 31, 2022. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered material to our business, taken in the aggregate, these patents provide meaningful protection for our products and technical innovations. Similarly, while our trademarks are important to identify our position in the industry, we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business. We are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and non-automotive industries and we have selectively taken licenses from others to support our business interests. These activities foster optimization of intellectual property rights.
Pricing. Cost-cutting initiatives adopted by our customers result in increased downward pressure on pricing. Our customer supply agreements generally require step-downs in component pricing over the periods of production and OEMs have historically possessed significant leverage over their outside suppliers because the automotive component supply industry is fragmented and serves a limited number of automotive OEMs. Our profitability depends in part on our ability to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions. In addition, during recent years, global economies and our industry were subjected to significant inflationary cost pressures, and these pressures are expected to continue in 2023. We continue to work with our customers, both through price recoveries and adjustments as well as future pricing adjustments as contracts renew, to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures on our results of operations.
We are focused on maintaining a low fixed cost structure that provides us flexibility to remain profitable at all points of the traditional vehicle industry production cycle. As a result, approximately 97% of our hourly workforce is located in best cost countries. Furthermore, we have substantial operational flexibility by leveraging a large workforce of contingent workers, which represented approximately 24% of the hourly workforce as of December 31, 2022. However, we will continue to adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint in response to changes in the global and regional automotive markets and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering, as evidenced by our ongoing restructuring programs focused on reducing our global overhead costs and on the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in Europe. As we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportunities to further refine our cost structure. Assuming constant product mix and pricing, based on our 2022 results, we estimate that our EBITDA breakeven level would be reached if we experienced a 45% downturn to current product volumes.
We have a strong balance sheet with gross debt of approximately $6.5 billion and substantial available liquidity of approximately $4.0 billion consisting of cash and cash equivalents, and available financing under our Revolving Credit Facility

and committed European accounts receivable factoring facility (as defined below in Liquidity and Capital Resources) as of December 31, 2022, and no significant U.S. defined benefit or workforce postretirement health care benefits and employer-paid postretirement basic life insurance benefits liabilities. We intend to maintain strong financial discipline by targeting industry-leading earnings growth, cash flow generation and return on invested capital and to maintain sufficient liquidity to sustain our financial flexibility throughout the industry cycle.
OEM product recalls. The number of vehicles recalled globally by OEMs has increased above historical levels. These recalls can either be initiated by the OEMs or influenced by regulatory agencies. Although there are differing rules and regulations across countries governing recalls for safety issues, the overall transition towards global vehicle platforms may also contribute to increased recalls outside of the U.S., as automotive components are increasingly standardized across regions. Given the sensitivity to safety issues in the automotive industry, including increased focus from regulators and consumers, we anticipate the number of automotive recalls may remain above historical levels in the near future. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, it is possible that we may be adversely affected in the future if the pace of these recalls continues.
Efficient use of capital. The global vehicle components industry is generally capital intensive and a portion of a supplier’s capital equipment is frequently utilized for specific customer programs. Lead times for procurement of capital equipment are long and typically exceed start of production by one to two years. Substantial advantages exist for suppliers that can leverage their prior investments in capital equipment or amortize the investment over higher volume global customer programs.
Industry consolidation and disruptive new entrants. Consolidation among worldwide OEMs and suppliers is expected to continue as these companies seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies, acquire complementary technologies and build stronger customer relationships. Additionally, the rise of advanced software and technologies in vehicles has attracted new and disruptive entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. These entrants may seek to gain access to certain vehicle technology and component markets. Any of these new competitors may develop and introduce technologies that gain greater customer or consumer acceptance, which could adversely affect the future growth of the Company. We believe companies with strong balance sheets and financial discipline are in the best position to take advantage of these trends.

Consolidated Results of Operations
Our total net sales during the year ended December 31, 2022 were $17.5 billion, an increase of approximately 12% compared to 2021. Our overall volumes increased 14%, which was driven, in part, by increased global automotive production of 5% (5% on an AWM basis) for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 2021 production rates. Despite the volatility caused by the global supply chain disruptions throughout 2022, our overall lean cost structure, along with continued above-market sales growth in all regions, has enabled us to achieve strong levels of operating income, while continuing to strategically invest in the future.
Aptiv typically experiences fluctuations in revenue due to changes in OEM production schedules, vehicle sales mix and the net of new and lost business (which we refer to collectively as volume), increased prices attributable to escalation clauses in our supply contracts for recovery of increased commodity costs (which we refer to as commodity pass-through), fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (which we refer to as “FX”), contractual reductions of the sales price to the OEM (which we refer to as contractual price reductions) and engineering changes. Changes in sales mix can have either favorable or unfavorable impacts on revenue. Such changes can be the result of shifts in regional growth, shifts in OEM sales demand, as well as shifts in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration. For instance, a shift in sales demand favoring a particular OEM’s vehicle model for which we do not have a supply contract may negatively impact our revenue. A shift in regional sales demand toward certain markets could favorably impact the sales of those of our customers that have a large market share in those regions, which in turn would be expected to have a favorable impact on our revenue.
We typically experience (as described below) fluctuations in operating income due to:
•Volume, net of contractual price reductions—changes in volume offset by contractual price reductions (which typically range from 1% to 3% of net sales) and changes in mix;
•Operational performance—changes to costs for materials and commodities or manufacturing and engineering variances; and
•Other—including restructuring costs and any remaining variances not included in Volume, net of contractual price reductions or Operational performance.
The automotive technology and component supply industry is traditionally subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor which may place operational and profitability burdens on the entire supply chain. For instance, the industry has recently been subjected to increased pricing pressures, specifically in relation to copper and petroleum-based resin products, which have experienced significant volatility in price. We have also been impacted globally by increased overall

inflation as a result of a variety of global trends. Due to various factors, the industry is also facing increased operating and logistics challenges from certain global supply chain disruptions, including a worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. This shortage has resulted in increased pricing pressures on semiconductors as well. In addition, we expect semiconductor supply cost and commodity cost volatility to have a continual impact on future earnings and/or operating cash flows. As such, we continually seek to mitigate both inflationary pressures and our material-related cost exposures using a number of approaches, including combining purchase requirements with customers and/or other suppliers, using alternate suppliers or product designs, negotiating cost reductions and/or commodity cost contract escalation clauses into our vehicle manufacturer supply contracts and hedging. We have also negotiated, and will continue to negotiate, price increases with our customers in response to the aforementioned global supply chain disruptions.

Total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 12% compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Our volumes increased 14% for the period, which reflects increased global automotive production of 5% (5% on an AWM basis), which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily related to the Euro and Chinese Yuan Renminbi. The increase in volumes is primarily attributable to increases in all regions. Our total net sales also reflect the favorable impact of price recoveries, net of contractual price reductions of $327 million, and net sales as a result of our acquisitions of Wind River and Intercable Automotive of $44 million, which is reflected in Other above. Refer to Note 20. Acquisitions and Divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further detail of the Company’s business acquisitions.

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales is primarily comprised of material, labor, manufacturing overhead, freight, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, product engineering, design and development expenses, depreciation and amortization, warranty costs and other operating expenses. Gross margin is revenue less cost of sales and gross margin percentage is gross margin as a percentage of net sales.
Cost of sales increased $1,672 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, as summarized below. The Company’s material cost of sales was approximately 55% and 50% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

We expect to make cash payments of approximately $65 million in 2023 pursuant to currently implemented restructuring programs.
The Company recorded employee-related and other restructuring charges related to these programs totaling approximately $24 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.
We expect to continue to incur additional restructuring expense in 2023 and beyond, primarily related to programs focused on reducing global overhead costs and the continued rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations in Europe, which includes approximately $10 million (of which approximately $5 million relates to the Advanced Safety and User Experience segment and approximately $5 million relates to the Signal and Power Solutions segment) for programs approved as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, as we continue to operate in a cyclical industry that is impacted by movements in the global and regional economies, we continually evaluate opportunities to further adjust our cost structure and optimize our manufacturing footprint. The Company plans to implement additional restructuring activities in the future, if necessary, in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing regional automotive production levels and locations, to improve the efficiency and utilization of other locations and in order to increase investment in advanced technologies and engineering. Such future restructuring actions are dependent on market conditions, customer actions and other factors.

effective tax rate is also impacted by the receipt of certain tax incentives and holidays that reduce the effective tax rate for certain subsidiaries below the statutory rate.
The Company’s effective tax rate was 12% and 11% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate in the year ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by favorable changes in valuation allowances offset by changes in reserves and provision to return adjustments. The effective tax rate was also impacted by impairments and charges related to our planned exit from our majority owned Russian subsidiary and other charges in Ukraine for which no tax benefit was recognized.
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was impacted by favorable provision to return adjustments as well as releases of valuation allowances as a result of the Company’s determination that it was more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would be realized. The Company also accrued $19 million of reserve adjustments for uncertain tax positions during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Equity loss, net of tax $ 279 $ 200 $ (79)

Equity loss, net of tax reflects the Company’s interest in the results of ongoing operations of entities accounted for as equity method investments. The equity losses recognized by Aptiv for each period presented are primarily attributable to the Motional autonomous driving joint venture.

Results of Operations by Segment
We operate our core business along the following operating segments, which are grouped on the basis of similar product, market and operating factors:
•Signal and Power Solutions, which includes complete electrical architecture and component products.
•Advanced Safety and User Experience, which includes vehicle technology and services in advanced safety, user experience and connectivity and security solutions, as well as cloud-native software platforms, autonomous driving technologies and DevOps tools.
•Eliminations and Other, which includes i) the elimination of inter-segment transactions, and ii) certain other expenses and income of a non-operating or strategic nature.
Generally, Aptiv evaluates segment performance based on stand-alone segment net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax (expense) benefit, equity income (loss), net of tax, amortization, restructuring, other acquisition and portfolio project costs (which includes costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures), asset impairments and other related charges and gains (losses) on business divestitures and other transactions (“Adjusted Operating Income”) and accounts for inter-segment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, at current market prices.
Effective on January 1, 2022, the Company now excludes amortization expense of intangible assets from the calculation of Adjusted Operating Income, as reflected in the definition below. The Company’s management believes that the updated calculation of this financial measure will be more useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company’s results of operations due to recent acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets generally results from a write-up in the value of assets in connection with an acquisition. The Company believes that exclusion of amortization expense will facilitate more comparable operating results of the Company over time, between periods when the Company is more or less acquisitive and allows for improved comparison with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. The historical presentation of Adjusted Operating Income in the tables below has been revised to be consistent with this updated calculation.
Our management utilizes segment Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss to evaluate segment performance, and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to the segments, as management believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Segment

Adjusted Operating Income should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income attributable to Aptiv, which is the most directly comparable financial measure to Adjusted Operating Income that is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment Adjusted Operating Income, as determined and measured by Aptiv, should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to operating income includes, as applicable, amortization, restructuring, other acquisition and portfolio project costs (which includes costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures), asset impairments and other related charges and gains (losses) on business divestitures and other transactions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview of Capital Structure
Our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations, including capital expenditures and working capital requirements, as well as to fund debt service requirements, operational restructuring activities and dividends on our outstanding preferred shares. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, our existing cash balance, and as necessary and available, borrowings under credit facilities and issuance of long-term debt and equity. To the extent we generate discretionary cash flow we may consider using this additional cash flow for optional prepayments of existing indebtedness, strategic acquisitions or investments, and/or general corporate purposes. We also continually explore ways to enhance our capital structure.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion and net debt (defined as outstanding debt less cash and cash equivalents) of $5.0 billion. We also have access to additional liquidity pursuant to the terms of the $2.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility and the committed European accounts receivable factoring facility, as described below. The following table summarizes our available liquidity, which includes cash, cash equivalents and funds available under our significant committed credit facilities, as of December 31, 2022.

Despite the current global economic impacts and uncertainties resulting from the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the ongoing global supply chain disruptions, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting direct and indirect impacts on global vehicle production, we currently expect existing cash, available liquidity and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities, including restructuring payments, any mandatory payments required under the Credit Agreement as described below, dividends on preferred shares and capital expenditures.
We also continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications, subject to current monetary policies. We utilize a combination of strategies, including

dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Aptiv. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately $1.4 billion. If additional non-U.S. cash was needed for our U.S. operations, we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; however, based on our current liquidity needs and strategies, we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts.
Based on these factors, we believe we possess sufficient liquidity to fund our global operations and capital investments in 2023 and beyond.

Autonomous Driving Joint Venture
On March 26, 2020, Aptiv completed a transaction with Hyundai to form Motional, a joint venture focused on the design, development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies. Under the terms of the agreement, Aptiv contributed to Motional autonomous driving technology, intellectual property and approximately 700 employees for a 50% ownership interest in Motional. Hyundai contributed to Motional approximately $1.6 billion in cash, along with vehicle engineering services, research and development resources and access to intellectual property for a 50% ownership interest in Motional. As a result, Motional is expected to fund all of its future operating expenses and investments in autonomous driving technologies for the foreseeable future. Consequently, Aptiv is not required to fund these investments and expenses, which approximated $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 prior to Motional’s formation. Upon closing of the transaction, Aptiv deconsolidated the carrying value of the associated assets and liabilities contributed to Motional, previously classified as held for sale, and recognized an asset of approximately $2 billion within investments in affiliates in the consolidated balance sheet, based on the preliminary fair value of its investment in Motional. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.4 billion in the consolidated statement of operations (approximately $5.32 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2020), net of transaction costs of $22 million, based on the difference between the carrying value of its contribution to Motional and the preliminary fair value of its investment in Motional. The estimated fair value of Aptiv’s ownership interest in Motional was determined primarily based on third-party valuations and management estimates, generally utilizing income and market approaches. Determining the fair value of Motional and the underlying assets required the use of management’s judgment and involved significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future cash flows, market rate

Table of Contents

assumptions, projected growth rates and margins, and appropriate discount rates, among other items. The estimated fair value was determined on a preliminary basis using information available in the first quarter of 2020 and was finalized in the first quarter of 2021. The effects of this transaction would not materially impact the Company’s reported results for any period presented, and the transaction did not meet the criteria to be reflected as a discontinued operation.
The Company’s investment in Motional is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and Aptiv recognized an equity loss of $291 million, $215 million and $98 million, net of tax, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Credit Agreement
Aptiv PLC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aptiv Corporation, entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), under which it maintains senior unsecured credit facilities currently consisting of a term loan (the “Tranche A Term Loan”) and a revolving credit facility of $2 billion (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Subsequently, Aptiv Global Financing Limited (“AGFL”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aptiv PLC, executed a joinder agreement to the Credit Agreement, which allows it to act as a borrower under the Credit Agreement, and a guaranty supplement, under which AGFL guarantees the obligations under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.
The Credit Agreement was entered into in March 2011 and has been subsequently amended and restated on several occasions, most recently on June 24, 2021. The June 2021 amendment, among other things, (1) refinanced and replaced the existing term loan A and revolver with a new term loan A that matures in 2026, and a new five-year revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $2 billion, (2) utilized the Company’s existing sustainability-linked metrics and commitments, that, if achieved, would change the facility fee and interest rate margins as described below, and (3) established the leverage ratio maintenance covenant that requires the Company to maintain total net leverage (as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement) of less than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement) and allowed for dividends and other payments on equity. Losses on modification of debt totaled $1 million and $4 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the June 2021 amendment and May 2020 amendment. Aptiv paid amendment fees of $6 million and $18 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are reflected as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Tranche A Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility mature on June 24, 2026. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, Aptiv was obligated to begin making quarterly principal payments on the Tranche A Term Loan according to the amortization schedule in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that permits Aptiv to increase, from time to time, the aggregate borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $1 billion upon Aptiv’s request, the agreement of the lenders participating in the increase, and the approval of the Administrative Agent.
As of December 31, 2022, there were no amounts drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility and less than $1 million in letters of credit were issued under the Credit Agreement. Letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement reduce availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. No amounts were drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at Aptiv’s option, at either (a) the Administrative Agent’s Alternate Base Rate (“ABR” as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (b) the London Interbank Offered Rate (the “Adjusted LIBO Rate” as defined in the Credit Agreement) (“LIBOR”) plus in either case a percentage per annum as set forth in the table below (the “Applicable Rate”). The June 2021 amendment also contains provisions to facilitate the replacement of the LIBOR-based rate with a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) based rate upon the discontinuation or unavailability of LIBOR. The Applicable Rates under the Credit Agreement on the specified dates are set forth below:

------------------------- ----------------- - ----------------- ----- ---------- -------- - ----- -
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021
 LIBOR plus ABR plus LIBOR plus ABR plus
Revolving Credit Facility 1.06 % 0.06 % 1.10 % 0.10 %
Tranche A Term Loan 1.105 % 0.105 % 1.125 % 0.125 %

Under the June 2021 amendment, the Applicable Rate under the Credit Agreement, as well as the facility fee, may increase or decrease from time to time based on changes in the Company’s credit ratings and whether the Company achieves or fails to achieve certain sustainability-linked targets with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and workplace safety. Such adjustments may be up to 0.04% per annum on interest rate margins on the Revolving Credit Facility, 0.02% per annum on interest rate margins on the Tranche A Term Loan and 0.01% per annum on the facility fee. Accordingly, the interest rate is subject to fluctuation during the term of the Credit Agreement based on changes in the ABR, LIBOR, changes in the Company’s corporate credit ratings or whether the Company achieves or fails to achieve its sustainability-linked targets. The

51

Table of Contents

Credit Agreement also requires that Aptiv pay certain facility fees on the Revolving Credit Facility, which are also subject to adjustment based on the sustainability-linked targets as described above, and certain letter of credit issuance and fronting fees. As a result of meeting the sustainability-linked targets for the 2021 calendar year, the interest rate margins and facility fees were reduced by the amounts specified above, effective in the third quarter of 2022.
The interest rate period with respect to LIBOR interest rate options can be set at one-, three-, or six-months as selected by Aptiv in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement (or other period as may be agreed by the applicable lenders). Aptiv may elect to change the selected interest rate option in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, Aptiv selected the one-month LIBOR interest rate option on the Tranche A Term Loan, and the rate effective as of December 31, 2022, as detailed in the table below, was based on the Company’s current credit rating and the Applicable Rate for the Credit Agreement:

Tranche A Term Loan LIBOR plus 1.105% $ 309 5.48 %

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at Aptiv’s option without premium or penalty.
The Credit Agreement contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Company’s (and the Company’s subsidiaries’) ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or liens or to dispose of substantially all of its assets. In addition, under the June 2021 amendment, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not more than 3.5 to 1.0 (or 4.0 to 1.0 for four full fiscal quarters following completion of material acquisitions, as defined in the Credit Agreement). Following completion of the acquisition of Wind River in December 2022, the Company elected to increase the ratio of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA to 4.0 to 1.0 commencing with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 20. Acquisitions and Divestitures to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for further information on this acquisition.
The Credit Agreement also contains events of default customary for financings of this type. The Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants as of December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, all obligations under the Credit Agreement were borrowed by Aptiv Corporation and jointly and severally guaranteed by AGFL and Aptiv PLC, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement.

Although the specific terms of each indenture governing each series of senior notes vary, the indentures contain certain restrictive covenants, including with respect to Aptiv’s (and Aptiv’s subsidiaries) ability to incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge with or into other entities.

Guarantor Summarized Financial Information
As further described in Note 11. Debt to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein, Aptiv PLC, Aptiv Corporation and AGFL are each potential borrowers under the Credit Agreement, under which such borrowings would be guaranteed by each of the other two entities. Aptiv PLC issued the 2015 Euro-denominated Senior Notes, 2016 Euro-denominated Senior Notes, 2016 Senior Notes, 2019 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes. In February 2022, Aptiv Corporation and AGFL were added as guarantors on each series of outstanding senior notes previously issued by Aptiv PLC. AGFL was added as a joint and several co-issuer of the 2021 Senior Notes in December 2021, effective as of the date of issuance. Aptiv PLC and Aptiv Corporation jointly issued the 2022 Senior Notes, which are guaranteed by AGFL. Together, Aptiv PLC, Aptiv Corporation and AGFL comprise the “Obligor Group.” All other consolidated direct and indirect subsidiaries of Aptiv PLC are not subject to any guarantee under any series of notes outstanding (the “Non-Guarantors”). The guarantees rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, are effectively subordinated to any of their existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness of each of their existing and future subsidiaries that is not a guarantor.
The below summarized financial information is presented on a combined basis after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the Obligor Group and equity in earnings from and investments in the Non-Guarantors. The below summarized financial information should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included herein, as the financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities.

The amounts below exclude the gross liability for uncertain tax positions of $224 million as of December 31, 2022. We do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months. We are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the non-current portion of obligations associated with uncertain tax positions. For more information, refer to Note 14. Income Taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein.

 In addition to the obligations discussed above, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans, some of which are funded. We have minimum funding requirements with respect to certain of our pension obligations and may periodically elect to make discretionary contributions to the plans in support of risk management initiatives. We will also have payments due with respect to our other postretirement benefit obligations. We do not fund our other postretirement benefit obligations and payments are made as costs are incurred by covered retirees. Refer to Note 12. Pension Benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional detail regarding our expected contributions to our pension plans and expected distributions to participants in future periods.
Capital Expenditures
Supplier selection in the automotive industry is generally finalized several years prior to the start of production of the vehicle. Therefore, current capital expenditures are based on customer commitments entered into previously, generally several years ago when the customer contract was awarded. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $253 million in outstanding cancellable and non-cancellable capital commitments. Capital expenditures by operating segment and geographic region for the periods presented were:

Cash Flows
Intra-month cash flow cycles vary by region, but in general we are users of cash through the first half of a typical month and we generate cash during the latter half of a typical month. Due to this cycle of cash flows, we may utilize short-term financing, including our Revolving Credit Facility and European accounts receivable factoring facility, to manage our intra-month working capital needs. Our cash balance typically peaks at month end.
We utilize a combination of strategies, including dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan structures and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. We utilize a global cash pooling arrangement to consolidate and manage our global cash balances, which enables us to efficiently move cash into and out of a number of the countries in which we operate.
Operating activities—Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,263 million and $1,222 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted primarily of net earnings of $590 million, increased by $792 million for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and pension costs, partially offset by $409 million related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of restructuring and pension contributions. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of net earnings of $609 million, increased by $938 million for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization, pension costs and extinguishment of debt, partially offset by $567 million related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of restructuring and pension contributions.
Investing activities—Net cash used in investing activities totaled $5,182 million and $729 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in usage is primarily attributable to $4,310 million paid for business acquisitions and other transactions, principally Wind River and Intercable Automotive, as compared to $130 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, capital expenditures increased $233 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.
Financing activities—Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $2,359 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net cash used in financing activities totaled $191 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily included net proceeds of $2,472 million received from the issuance of the 2022 Senior Notes, partially offset by $63 million of MCPS dividend payments. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 included proceeds of $1,450 million received from the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes, which were utilized to redeem the $700 million 2014 Senior Notes and $650 million 4.25% Senior Notes, and $63 million of MCPS dividend payments.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not engage in any off-balance sheet financial arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, which is further exacerbated by, among other factors, the unknown future duration and severity of the impacts of the ongoing global supply chain disruptions and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.
We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:
•It requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate, and
•Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
Acquisitions and Other Transactions
In accordance with the accounting guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations, we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. The process to estimate fair value described herein is generally applicable to other transactions, including the fair value estimates used in establishing the identifiable assets, liabilities and goodwill recorded upon formation of Motional, Aptiv’s autonomous driving joint venture, and the resulting equity method investment recorded on Aptiv’s balance sheet.
An acquisition may include a contingent consideration component. The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated as of the date of the acquisition and is recorded as part of the purchase price. This estimate is updated in future periods and any changes in the estimate, which are not considered an adjustment to the purchase price, are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.
An acquisition may also include a redeemable noncontrolling interest component. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest is recorded to temporary equity in the consolidated balance sheet and is estimated as of the date of acquisition using a Monte Carlo simulation approach, which includes several assumptions including estimated future profitability, expected volatility rate and risk free rate. The redeemable noncontrolling interest is then adjusted each reporting period for the income (loss) attributable to the noncontrolling interest, and for any measurement period adjustments necessary to record the redeemable noncontrolling interest at the higher of its redemption value, assuming it was redeemable at the reporting date, or its carrying value. Any measurement period adjustments are recorded to retained earnings, with a corresponding increase or reduction to net income attributable to Aptiv.
We use all available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed.
Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies.
Other estimates used in determining fair value include, but are not limited to, future cash flows or income related to intangibles, market rate assumptions, actuarial assumptions for benefit plans and appropriate discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain, and therefore, may not be realized. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.
Warranty Obligations and Product Recall Costs
Estimating warranty obligations requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold. We base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts, combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers. The key factors which impact our estimates are (1) the stated or implied warranty period; (2) OEM source; (3) OEM policy decisions regarding warranty claims; and (4) OEMs seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis.

56

Table of Contents

Actual warranty obligations could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to existing reserves in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing these estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.
In addition to our ordinary warranty provisions with customers, we are also at risk for product recall costs, which are costs incurred when a customer or the Company recalls a product through a formal campaign soliciting return of that product. In addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) has the authority, under certain circumstances, to require recalls to remedy safety concerns. Product recall costs typically include the cost of the product being replaced as well as the customer’s cost of the recall, including labor to remove and replace the recalled part. The Company accrues for costs related to product recalls as part of our warranty accrual at the time an obligation becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Actual costs incurred could differ from the amounts estimated, requiring adjustments to these reserves in future periods. It is possible that changes in our assumptions or future product recall issues could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Legal and Other Contingencies
We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims, including commercial or contractual disputes, product liability claims, government investigations, product warranties and environmental and other matters, that arise in the normal course of business. We routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses, by consulting with internal personnel involved with such matters as well as with outside legal counsel handling such matters. We have accrued for estimated losses for those matters where we believe that the likelihood of a loss has occurred, is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. The determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel involved with such matters and with outside legal counsel handling such matters. The amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution. Refer to Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.
Restructuring
Accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions. These accruals include estimates primarily related to employee termination costs, contract termination costs and other related exit costs in conjunction with workforce reduction and programs related to the rationalization of manufacturing and engineering processes. Actual costs may vary from these estimates. These accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified.
Pensions
We use actuarial estimates and related actuarial methods to calculate our obligation and expense. We are required to select certain actuarial assumptions, which are determined based on current market conditions, historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries and asset managers. Refer to Note 12. Pension Benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details. The key factors which impact our estimates are (1) discount rates; (2) asset return assumptions; and (3) actuarial assumptions such as retirement age and mortality which are determined as of the current year measurement date. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. Experience gains and losses, as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and plan provisions are recognized in other comprehensive income. Cumulative actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) for a particular plan are amortized over the average future service period of the employees in that plan.
The principal assumptions used to determine the pension expense and the actuarial value of the projected benefit obligation for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans were:

Weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets N/A N/A N/A 4.46 % 4.29 % 4.68 %

We select discount rates by analyzing the results of matching each plan’s projected benefit obligations with a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments rated AA or higher by Standard and Poor’s or Moody’s.
Aptiv does not have any U.S. pension assets; therefore no U.S. asset rate of return calculation was necessary. The primary funded non-U.S. plans are in the U.K. and Mexico. For the determination of 2022 expense, we assumed a long-term expected asset rate of return of approximately 3.75% and 7.50% for the U.K. and Mexico, respectively. We evaluated input from local actuaries and asset managers, including consideration of recent fund performance and historical returns, in developing the long-term rate of return assumptions. The assumptions for the U.K. and Mexico are primarily conservative long-term, prospective rates. To determine the expected return on plan assets, the market-related value of our plan assets is actual fair value.
Our pension expense for 2023 is determined at the December 31, 2022 measurement date. For purposes of analysis, the following table highlights the sensitivity of our pension obligations and expense attributable to changes in key assumptions:

----------------------------------------------------- ------------------------- --------------
Change in Assumption Impact on Pension Expense Impact on PBO
25 basis point (“bp”) decrease in discount rate Less than + $1 million ‘+ $16 million
25 bp increase in discount rate ‘- $1 million ‘- $15 million
25 bp decrease in long-term expected return on assets ‘+ $1 million —
25 bp increase in long-term expected return on assets ‘- $1 million —

The above sensitivities reflect the effect of changing one assumption at a time. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. The above sensitivities also assume no changes to the design of the pension plans and no major restructuring programs.
Based on information provided by our actuaries and asset managers, we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable; however, changes in these assumptions could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Refer to Note 12. Pension Benefits to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Investments in Affiliates and Expected Useful Lives
We monitor our long-lived and definite-lived assets, including our investments in affiliates, the most significant of which is our investment in Motional AD LLC, for impairment indicators on an ongoing basis based on projections of anticipated future cash flows, including future profitability assessments of various manufacturing sites when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. An impairment loss is measured as the difference between the net book value and the estimated fair value of the long-lived assets. Even if an impairment charge is not required, a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets. We estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data, independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments and review of appraisals. The key factors which impact our estimates are (1) future production estimates; (2) customer preferences and decisions; (3) product pricing; (4) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (5) product life / business retention. Any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values, which could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition. We believe that the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
We periodically review goodwill for impairment indicators. We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The Company performs the goodwill impairment review at the reporting unit level. We perform a qualitative assessment (step 0) of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is performed. If so, we perform the step 1 test discussed hereafter. Our qualitative assessment involves significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, financial performance of the Company, reporting unit specific events and changes in the Company’s share price.
If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount (step 1), goodwill is not considered to be impaired. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of a future discounted cash flow valuation model and, if possible, a comparable market transaction model. Estimating fair value requires the Company to make judgments about appropriate discount rates, growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an entity must record an impairment charge based on the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. Similar to the goodwill assessment described above, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If necessary, the Company then performs a quantitative impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset, based upon its forecasted cash flows, to its carrying value. Other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment testing only if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired, as described above.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods.
When establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future sources of taxable income such as “future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies.” A tax planning strategy is defined as “an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused; and would result in realization of deferred tax assets.” In the event we determine it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment and accounting for the deferred tax effect of events that have been recorded in the financial statements or in tax returns and our future projected profitability. Changes in our estimates, due to unforeseen events or otherwise, could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at that time. We use a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured and tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. We report tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate. Refer to Note 14. Income Taxes to the audited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information.

As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...
