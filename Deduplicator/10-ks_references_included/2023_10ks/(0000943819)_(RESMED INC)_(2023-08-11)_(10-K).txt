ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. It is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report.
We are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software applications that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders, including sleep disordered breathing (“SDB”), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our cloud-based digital software health applications, along with our devices, are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers.
Since the development of continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes. Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and other respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as significant health concerns.
We are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements. During fiscal year 2023, we invested $287.6 million on research and development activities, which represents 6.8% of net revenues with a continued focus on the development and commercialization of new, innovative products and solutions that improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers and help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and lower healthcare costs. During fiscal year 2023 we continued the launch of AirSense 11, which introduces new features such as a touch screen, algorithms for patients new to therapy and digital enhancements and over-the-air update capabilities as well as continued our global offering of devices including Card-to-Cloud ("C2C") versions of our prior model AirSense 10 and AirCurve 10 products that do not incorporate a communications module. Due to multiple acquisitions, including Brightree in 2016, HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare in 2018, and MEDIFOX DAN in November 2022, our operations now include out-of-hospital software platforms designed to support the professionals and caregivers who help people stay healthy in the home or care setting of their choice. These platforms comprise our SaaS business and along with our cloud-based remote monitoring and therapy management system, and a robust product pipeline, should continue to provide us with a strong platform for future growth.
We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”).
Net revenue in fiscal year 2023 increased to $4,223.0 million, an increase of 18% compared to fiscal year 2022. Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2023 to $2,355.7 million, from $2,024.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $331.4 million or 16%. Our net income for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $897.6 million or $6.09 per diluted share compared to net income of $779.4 million or $5.30 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2022.
Total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2023 was $693.3 million and at June 30, 2023, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $227.9 million. At June 30, 2023, our total assets were $6.8 billion and our stockholders’ equity was $4.1 billion. We paid a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share during fiscal 2023 with a total amount of $258.3 million paid to stockholders.

RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency basis”, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. In order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to fiscal year June 30, 2021, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended June 30, 2022, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12, 2022.

Sleep and Respiratory Care
Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased to $3,725.0 million from $3,177.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $547.7 million or 17%. Movements in international currencies against the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately $95.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of currency movements, total net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased by 20% compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. The increase in net revenue associated with devices was primarily attributable to increased demand, reduced competitive supply, increases in average selling prices, and incremental sales of the C2C devices. The increase in masks was primarily due to an increase in unit sales.

Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business in the United States, Canada and Latin America for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased to $2,483.4 million from $1,981.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $501.6 million or 25%. The increase in net revenue associated with our devices was primarily attributable to increased demand, reduced competitive supply, and incremental sales of the C2C devices. The increase in masks was primarily due to an increase in unit sales.
Net revenue from our Sleep and Respiratory Care business in combined Europe, Asia and other markets increased for the year ended June 30, 2023 to $1,241.6 million from $1,195.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $46.1 million or 4% (an 11% increase on a constant currency basis). The constant currency increase in device sales in combined Europe, Asia and other was primarily attributable to increased demand as well as reduced competitive supply. The increase in masks was primarily due to an increase in unit sales.
Net revenue from devices for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased to $2,270.7 million from $1,866.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $403.8 million or 22%, including an increase of 35% in the United States, Canada and Latin America and an increase of 4% in combined Europe, Asia and other markets (an 11% increase on a constant currency basis). Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, device sales for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased by 25%.
Net revenue from masks and other for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased to $1,454.3 million from $1,310.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 11%, including an increase of 14% in the United States, Canada and Latin America and an increase of 4% in combined Europe, Asia and other markets (a 12% increase on a constant currency basis). Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, masks and other sales increased by 14%, compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.
Software as a Service
Net revenue from our SaaS business for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $498.0 million, compared to $400.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $97.1 million or 24%. The increase was predominantly due to our recent acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, which was acquired on November 21, 2022. Excluding the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition, SaaS revenue increased 8% and was driven by continued growth in the HME vertical within our SaaS business.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin. Gross profit increased for the year ended June 30, 2023 to $2,355.7 million from $2,024.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $331.4 million or 16%. Gross margin, which is gross profit as a percentage of net revenue, was 55.8% for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared with the 56.6% for the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to unfavorable product mix, higher component and manufacturing costs, higher warehouse related costs, and unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices and a decrease in the amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Operating Expenses

the year ended June 30, 2022. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased to 20.7% compared to 20.6% for the year ended June 30, 2022.
The constant currency increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs, increases in travel and entertainment expenses, and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2023 to $287.6 million from $253.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $34.1 million or 13%. Research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $6.5 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased by 16% compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.8% for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to 7.1% for the year ended June 30, 2022.
The constant currency increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased investment in our digital health technologies and SaaS solutions as well as additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets
Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $42.0 million compared to $31.1 million for the year ended the year ended June 30, 2022. The increase in amortization expense was primarily attributable to our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN.
Restructuring Expenses
During the year ended June 30, 2023, we incurred restructuring expenses of $9.2 million associated with the reorganization and rationalization of our operations. We recorded the full amount of $9.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2023, of which $6.7 million related to our Sleep and Respiratory Care segment and $2.5 million related to our SaaS segment. The restructuring expenses consisted primarily of severance to employees.

Total other income (loss), net for the year ended June 30, 2023 was a loss of $30.2 million, compared to a loss of $39.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. Interest expense, net, increased to $47.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to $22.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 due to higher debt levels associated with the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, which was funded by our Revolving Credit Facility. Increases in interest expense, net, were partially offset by gains associated with our investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities, which were a gain of $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to a loss of $12.2 million or the year ended June 30, 2022. In addition, we recognized recoveries from business interruption insurance for $20.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2023.

Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rate decreased to 18.5% for the year ended June 30, 2023 from 18.8% for the year ended June 30, 2022. Our effective rate of 18.5% for the year ended June 30, 2023 differs from the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to research credits, foreign operations and windfall tax benefits related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings and an increase in research credits.
Our Singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable during the year ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax, if repatriated.

Net Income and Earnings per Share
As a result of the factors discussed above, our net income for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $897.6 million compared to net income of $779.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. Our earnings per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $6.09 compared to $5.30 for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 15%.

Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in evaluating the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide investors better insight when evaluating our performance from core operations and can provide more consistent financial reporting across periods. For these reasons, we use non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The measure “non-GAAP cost of sales” is equal to GAAP cost of sales less amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales. The measure “non-GAAP gross profit” is the difference between GAAP net revenue and non-GAAP cost of sales, and “non-GAAP gross margin” is the ratio of non-GAAP gross profit to GAAP net revenue.
These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below (in thousands, except percentages):

------------------------------------------ ------------------- --------- ---- -------- - ---------
 Year Ended June 30,
 2023 2022
GAAP Net revenue $ 4,222,993 $ 3,578,127

GAAP Cost of sales $ 1,867,331 $ 1,553,816
Less: Amortization of acquired intangibles (30,396) (39,650)

Non-GAAP cost of sales $ 1,836,935 $ 1,514,166

GAAP gross profit $ 2,355,662 $ 2,024,311
GAAP gross margin 55.8 % 56.6 %

GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 6.09 $ 5.30
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 6.44 $ 5.79

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and access to our revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development activities, selling and marketing activities, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, dividend payments and repayment of debt obligations. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of several factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, which include supply chain disruptions, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate in net revenue, third-party reimbursement of our products for our customers, the timing and extent of spending to support research development efforts, the expansion of selling, general and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products, the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions, investments or other business combination transactions. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. If we are required to access the debt market, we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market considering those earning levels.

As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $227.9 million and $273.7 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held within the United States at June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 were $49.3 million and $70.0 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, were $178.6 million and $203.7 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.
As of June 30, 2023, we had $745.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility and a combined total of $972.9 million in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility.
We repatriated $445.0 million and $100.0 million to the United States during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the United States in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2023 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the United States, such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations.
As a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable, which resulted in additional tax expense of $126.9 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated, except as discussed in Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8).
We believe that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations, including expected capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond.
Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes
On June 29, 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of $1,000.0 million or 1.0 times the EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. Additionally, on June 29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”). The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of $200.0 million. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on Jun 29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. As of June 30, 2023, we had $745.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility.
On July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July 10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July 10, 2029 (“Senior Notes”).
On June 30, 2023, there was a total of $1,445.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. We expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities.

The $342.2 million increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the payment of our tax settlement with the ATO of $284.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2022 and an increase in operating profit for the year ended June 30, 2023.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $1,159.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to cash used of $229.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The $929.9 million increase in cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to the cash used to acquire MEDIFOX DAN.
Financing Activities
Cash provided by in financing activities was $422.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2023, compared to cash used of $128.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. The $551.2 million increase in cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily due to the borrowing activity under our Revolving Credit Agreement in order to finance our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN.
Dividends
During the year ended June 30, 2023, we paid cash dividends of $1.76 per common share totaling $258.3 million. On August 3, 2023, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.48 per common share, to be paid on September 21, 2023, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 17, 2023.

Segment Information
We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the Sleep and Respiratory Care segment and the SaaS segment. See Note 13 – Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies.
We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
(1)Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets. We make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. Our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. The criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as an impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value, and for goodwill is limited to the value of goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting unit, as described in Step 1 below. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.
We conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level based on the following steps:
Step 0 or Qualitative assessment – Evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance or events-specific to that reporting unit. If or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, we would move to Step 1 of the quantitative method.
Step 1 – Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.
During the annual reviews for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we completed a Step 0 or Qualitative assessment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, and therefore goodwill was not impaired.
(2)Income Tax. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. If we determine that it

PART II Item 7
RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Alternatively, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. These changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results.
Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Based on our regular assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
On September 19, 2021, we concluded the settlement agreement with the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) in relation to the previously disclosed transfer pricing dispute for the tax years 2009 through 2018 (“ATO settlement”). The ATO settlement fully resolved the dispute for all prior years, with no admission of liability and provides clarity in relation to certain future taxation principles.
The final net impact of the ATO settlement was recorded during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022 in the amount of $238.7 million, which represents a gross amount of $381.7 million, including interest and penalties of $48.1 million, and adjustments for credits and deductions of $143.0 million. As a result of the ATO settlement and due to movements in foreign currencies, we recorded a benefit of $14.1 million within other comprehensive income, and a $4.1 million reduction of tax credits, which was recorded to income tax expense. As a result of the ATO settlement, we reversed our previously recorded uncertain tax position.
On September 28, 2021, we remitted final payment to the ATO of $284.8 million, consisting of the agreed settlement amount of $381.7 million less prior remittances made to the ATO of $96.9 million.
Tax years 2018 to 2022 remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.
(3)Revenue Recognition. We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”). For products in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business, we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms. For our SaaS business, revenue associated with cloud-hosted services are recognized as they are provided. We defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our SaaS business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some SaaS contracts. Generally, deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years. Our contracts do not contain significant financing components.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. In our Sleep and Respiratory Care segment, the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives (e.g. rebates, discounts, free goods) and returns offered to our customers and their customers. When we give customers the right to return eligible products and receive credit, returns are estimated based on an analysis of our historical experience. However, returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, have historically been infrequent and insignificant. We adjust the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed.

RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We offer our Sleep and Respiratory Care customers cash or product rebates based on volume or sales targets measured over quarterly or annual periods. We estimate rebates based on each customer’s expected achievement of its targets. In accounting for these rebate programs, we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer. Rebates measured over a quarterly period are updated based on actual sales results and, therefore, no estimation is required to determine the reduction to revenue. For rebates measured over annual periods, we update our estimates each quarter based on actual sales results and updated forecasts for the remaining rebate periods.
We participate in programs where we issue credits to our Sleep and Respiratory Care distributors when they are required to sell our products below negotiated list prices if we have preexisting contracts with the distributors' customers. We reduce revenue for future credits at the time of sale to the distributor, which we estimate based on historical experience using the expected value method.
We also offer discounts to both our Sleep and Respiratory Care as well as our SaaS customers as part of normal business practice and these are deducted from revenue when the sale occurs.
When Sleep and Respiratory Care or SaaS contracts have multiple performance obligations, we generally use an observable price to determine the stand-alone selling price by reference to pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately to similar customers. Revenue is then allocated proportionately, based on the determined stand-alone selling price, to each performance obligation. An allocation is not required for many of our Sleep and Respiratory Care contracts that have a single performance obligation, which is the shipment of our therapy-based equipment.
(4)Business Combinations. The MEDIFOX DAN acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. The acquisition method of accounting involved the allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This allocation process involves the use of estimates and assumptions made in connection with determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including cash flows expected to be derived from the use of the asset, the timing of such cash flows, the remaining useful life of assets and applicable discount rates. We have finalized our allocation of consideration to net tangible and intangible assets acquired as of June 30, 2023.
In the event that actual results vary from the estimates or assumptions used in the valuation or allocation process, we may be required to record an impairment charge or an increase in depreciation or amortization in future periods, or both. Refer to Note 17, Business Combinations, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information about accounting for the MEDIFOX DAN acquisition.

In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we provide certain financial information on a “constant currency basis”, which is in addition to the actual financial information presented. In order to calculate our constant currency information, we translate the current period financial information using the foreign currency exchange rates that were in effect during the previous comparable period. However, constant currency measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to U.S. dollar measures that reflect current period exchange rates, or to other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).
For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to fiscal year June 30, 2021, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year Ended June 30, 2022, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on August 12, 2022.

The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to unfavorable product mix, higher component and manufacturing costs, higher warehouse related costs, and unfavorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by increases in average selling prices and a decrease in the amortization of acquired intangible assets.

the year ended June 30, 2022. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased to 20.7% compared to 20.6% for the year ended June 30, 2022.
The constant currency increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to increases in employee-related costs, increases in travel and entertainment expenses, and additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased for the year ended June 30, 2023 to $287.6 million from $253.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of $34.1 million or 13%. Research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the movement of international currencies against the U.S. dollar, which decreased our expenses by approximately $6.5 million, as reported in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, research and development expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 increased by 16% compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. As a percentage of net revenue, research and development expenses were 6.8% for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to 7.1% for the year ended June 30, 2022.
The constant currency increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased investment in our digital health technologies and SaaS solutions as well as additional expenses associated with the consolidation of recent acquisitions.
Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets
Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $42.0 million compared to $31.1 million for the year ended the year ended June 30, 2022. The increase in amortization expense was primarily attributable to our acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN.
Restructuring Expenses
During the year ended June 30, 2023, we incurred restructuring expenses of $9.2 million associated with the reorganization and rationalization of our operations. We recorded the full amount of $9.2 million during the year ended June 30, 2023, of which $6.7 million related to our Sleep and Respiratory Care segment and $2.5 million related to our SaaS segment. The restructuring expenses consisted primarily of severance to employees.

Total other income (loss), net for the year ended June 30, 2023 was a loss of $30.2 million, compared to a loss of $39.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. Interest expense, net, increased to $47.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to $22.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 due to higher debt levels associated with the acquisition of MEDIFOX DAN, which was funded by our Revolving Credit Facility. Increases in interest expense, net, were partially offset by gains associated with our investments in marketable and non-marketable equity securities, which were a gain of $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to a loss of $12.2 million or the year ended June 30, 2022. In addition, we recognized recoveries from business interruption insurance for $20.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2023. We recorded lower losses attributable to equity method investments for the year ended June 30, 2023 of $7.3 million compared to $8.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2022.

Income Taxes
Our effective income tax rate decreased to 18.5% for the year ended June 30, 2023 from 18.8% for the year ended June 30, 2022. Our effective rate of 18.5% for the year ended June 30, 2023 differs from the statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to research credits, foreign operations and windfall tax benefits related to the vesting or settlement of employee share-based awards. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2023 was primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings and an increase in research credits.
Our Singapore operations operate under certain tax holidays and tax incentive programs that will expire in whole or in part at various dates through June 30, 2030. As a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable during the year ended June 30, 2018. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax, if repatriated.

Net Income and Earnings per Share
As a result of the factors discussed above, our net income for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $897.6 million compared to net income of $779.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2022. Our earnings per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2023 was $6.09 compared to $5.30 for the year ended June 30, 2022, an increase of 15%.

Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP cost of sales, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in evaluating the performance of our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, can provide investors better insight when evaluating our performance from core operations and can provide more consistent financial reporting across periods. For these reasons, we use non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting, and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The measure “non-GAAP cost of sales” is equal to GAAP cost of sales less amortization of acquired intangible assets relating to cost of sales. The measure “non-GAAP gross profit” is the difference between GAAP net revenue and non-GAAP cost of sales, and “non-GAAP gross margin” is the ratio of non-GAAP gross profit to GAAP net revenue.
These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures below (in thousands, except percentages):

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations and access to our revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash have been for research and development activities, selling and marketing activities, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments, dividend payments and repayment of debt obligations. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of several factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, which include supply chain disruptions, working capital requirements and capital deployment decisions.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate in net revenue, third-party reimbursement of our products for our customers, the timing and extent of spending to support research development efforts, the expansion of selling, general and administrative activities, the timing of introductions of new products, the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions, investments or other business combination transactions. As we assess inorganic growth strategies, we may need to supplement our internally generated cash flow with outside sources. If we are required to access the debt market, we believe that we will be able to secure reasonable borrowing rates. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our current level of earnings and cash flow generation as well as our ability to access the market considering those earning levels.

As of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $227.9 million and $273.7 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents held within the United States at June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022 were $49.3 million and $70.0 million, respectively. Our remaining cash and cash equivalent balances at June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, were $178.6 million and $203.7 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalent balances are held at highly rated financial institutions.
As of June 30, 2023, we had $745.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility and a combined total of $972.9 million in cash and available liquidity under the revolving credit facility.
We repatriated $445.0 million and $100.0 million to the United States during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from earnings generated in each of those years. The amount of the current year foreign earnings that we have repatriated to the United States in the past has been determined, and the amount that we expect to repatriate during fiscal year 2023 will be determined, based on a variety of factors, including current year earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, foreign investment needs and the cash flow needs we have in the United States, such as for the repayment of debt, dividend distributions, and other domestic obligations.
As a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we treated all non-U.S. historical earnings as taxable, which resulted in additional tax expense of $126.9 million which was payable over the proceeding eight years. Therefore, future repatriation of cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries will generally not be subject to U.S. federal tax if repatriated, except as discussed in Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8).
We believe that our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations, including expected capital expenditures, for the next 12 months and beyond.
Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes
On June 29, 2022, we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Credit Agreement, among other things, provided a senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $1,500.0 million, with an uncommitted option to increase the revolving credit facility by an additional amount equal to the greater of $1,000.0 million or 1.0 times the EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month measurement period. Additionally, on June 29, 2022, ResMed Pty Limited entered into a Second Amendment to the Syndicated Facility Agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”). The Term Credit Agreement, among other things, provides ResMed Limited a senior unsecured term credit facility of $200.0 million. The Revolving Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement each terminate on Jun 29, 2027, when all unpaid principal and interest under the loans must be repaid. As of June 30, 2023, we had $745.0 million available for draw down under the revolving credit facility.
On July 10, 2019, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the purchasers to that agreement, in connection with the issuance and sale of $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.24% senior notes due July 10, 2026, and $250.0 million principal amount of our 3.45% senior notes due July 10, 2029 (“Senior Notes”).
On June 30, 2023, there was a total of $1,445.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. We expect to satisfy all of our liquidity and long-term debt requirements through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt facilities.

Segment Information
We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the Sleep and Respiratory Care segment and the SaaS segment. See Note 13 – Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting. Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, warranty obligations, goodwill, potentially impaired assets, intangible assets, income taxes and contingencies.
We state these accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. The estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:
(1)Valuation of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets. We make assumptions in establishing the carrying value, fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets. Our goodwill impairment tests are performed at our reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments. The criteria used for these evaluations include management’s estimate of the asset’s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset, as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives. If assets are considered to be impaired, we recognize as an impairment the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value, and for goodwill is limited to the value of goodwill allocated to the impaired reporting unit, as described in Step 1 below. Factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset’s ability to generate positive cash flow, loss of legal ownership or title to the asset, a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends, significant changes in our strategic business objectives, utilization of the asset, and a significant change in the economic and/or political conditions in certain countries.
We conduct an annual review for goodwill impairment at our reporting unit level based on the following steps:
Step 0 or Qualitative assessment – Evaluate qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The factors we consider include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance or events-specific to that reporting unit. If or when we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill, we would move to Step 1 of the quantitative method.
Step 1 – Compare the fair value for each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted cash flows. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary.
During the annual reviews for the years ended June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we completed a Step 0 or Qualitative assessment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, and therefore goodwill was not impaired.
(2)Income Tax. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to audit based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. If we determine that it

PART II Item 7
RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

is not more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Alternatively, if we determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, any previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. These changes to the valuation allowance and resulting increases or decreases in income tax expense may have a material effect on our operating results.
Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions subject to audit by various tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Based on our regular assessment, we may adjust the income tax provision and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known.
On September 19, 2021, we concluded the settlement agreement with the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) in relation to the previously disclosed transfer pricing dispute for the tax years 2009 through 2018 (“ATO settlement”). The ATO settlement fully resolved the dispute for all prior years, with no admission of liability and provides clarity in relation to certain future taxation principles.
The final net impact of the ATO settlement was recorded during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022 in the amount of $238.7 million, which represents a gross amount of $381.7 million, including interest and penalties of $48.1 million, and adjustments for credits and deductions of $143.0 million. As a result of the ATO settlement and due to movements in foreign currencies, we recorded a benefit of $14.1 million within other comprehensive income, and a $4.1 million reduction of tax credits, which was recorded to income tax expense. As a result of the ATO settlement, we reversed our previously recorded uncertain tax position.
On September 28, 2021, we remitted final payment to the ATO of $284.8 million, consisting of the agreed settlement amount of $381.7 million less prior remittances made to the ATO of $96.9 million.
Tax years 2018 to 2022 remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax.
(3)Revenue Recognition. We have determined that we have two operating segments, which are the sleep and respiratory disorders sector of the medical device industry (“Sleep and Respiratory Care”) and the supply of business management software as a service to out-of-hospital health providers (“SaaS”). For products in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business, we transfer control and recognize a sale when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contractual shipping terms. For our SaaS business, revenue associated with cloud-hosted services are recognized as they are provided. We defer the recognition of a portion of the consideration received when performance obligations are not yet satisfied. Consideration received from customers in advance of revenue recognition is classified as deferred revenue. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our Sleep and Respiratory Care business relate primarily to extended warranties on our devices and the provision of data for patient monitoring. Performance obligations resulting in deferred revenue in our SaaS business relate primarily to the provision of software access with maintenance and support over an agreed term and material rights associated with future discounts upon renewal of some SaaS contracts. Generally, deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years. Our contracts do not contain significant financing components.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. In our Sleep and Respiratory Care segment, the amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies with changes in marketing incentives (e.g. rebates, discounts, free goods) and returns offered to our customers and their customers. When we give customers the right to return eligible products and receive credit, returns are estimated based on an analysis of our historical experience. However, returns of products, excluding warranty-related returns, have historically been infrequent and insignificant. We adjust the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration can be estimated, the amount expected to be received changes, or when the consideration becomes fixed.

PART II Item 7
RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We offer our Sleep and Respiratory Care customers cash or product rebates based on volume or sales targets measured over quarterly or annual periods. We estimate rebates based on each customer’s expected achievement of its targets. In accounting for these rebate programs, we reduce revenue ratably as sales occur over the rebate period by the expected value of the rebates to be returned to the customer. Rebates measured over a quarterly period are updated based on actual sales results and, therefore, no estimation is required to determine the reduction to revenue. For rebates measured over annual periods, we update our estimates each quarter based on actual sales results and updated forecasts for the remaining rebate periods.
We participate in programs where we issue credits to our Sleep and Respiratory Care distributors when they are required to sell our products below negotiated list prices if we have preexisting contracts with the distributors']:
NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES Income before income taxes for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following: -------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - ----- (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Domestic $ 1,958 $ 1,736 $ 1,090 Foreign 4,050 3,969 3,086 Income before income taxes $ 6,008 $ 5,705 $ 4,176 The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following: ----------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ----- ---- --- ------- - ------- (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Current: United States federal $ 465 $ 391 $ 119 Foreign 329 197 222 State and local 132 103 79 Total current 926 691 420 Deferred: United States federal (45) (148) (123) Foreign 360 359 (1,313) State and local 11 (19) (68) Total deferred 326 192 (1,504) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 1,252 $ 883 $ (1,084) Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights ("IP rights") During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...
