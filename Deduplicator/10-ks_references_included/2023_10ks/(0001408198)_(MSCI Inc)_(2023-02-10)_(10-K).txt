Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of the operations of MSCI Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2022. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion summarizing the significant factors affecting the results of operations and financial condition of MSCI for the year ended December 31, 2021 can be found in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Annual Report”), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 11, 2022.

Overview
We are a leading provider of critical decision support tools and solutions for the global investment community. Our mission-critical offerings help investors address the challenges of a transforming investment landscape and power better investment decisions. Leveraging our knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research, data and technology, we enable our clients to understand and analyze key drivers of risk and return and confidently and efficiently build more effective portfolios. We operate in four reportable segments as follows: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, and All Other – Private Assets.
The operating segments of Real Assets and The Burgiss Group, LLC (“Burgiss”) do not individually meet the segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of the All Other – Private Assets reportable segment. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we renamed the Real Estate operating segment to Real Assets.
Our growth strategy includes: (a) extending leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes, (b) leading the enablement of ESG and climate investment integration, (c) enhancing distribution and content-enabling technology, (d) expanding solutions that empower client customization, (e) strengthening client relationships and growing into strategic partnerships with clients and (f) executing strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies. For more information about our Company’s operations, see “Item 1: Business”.

Key Financial and Operating Metrics and Drivers
In evaluating our financial performance, we focus on revenue and profit growth, including results accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) as well as non-GAAP measures, for the Company as a whole and by operating segment.
We present revenues disaggregated by types and by segments, which represent our major product lines. We also review expenses by activity, which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed. In addition, we utilize operating metrics including Run Rate, subscription sales and Retention Rate to manage and assess performance and to provide deeper insights into the recurring portion of our business.
In the discussion that follows, we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period. While operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes asset-based fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the underlying AUM, which is the primary component of asset-based fees, is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately three-fifths of the AUM is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and accordingly, any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currency-adjusted variances.
Revenues
Our revenues are presented by type and by reportable segment. For each reportable segment, we present revenues disaggregated by the nature of the revenues, which are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues.
Recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms. The fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance, prior to the license start date.

Table of Contents
Asset-based fees represent fees earned that are variable in nature, as they are primarily calculated based on the AUM linked to our indexes. Asset-based fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes, which are based on trading volumes and fee levels.
Non-recurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we typically do not have renewal clauses within the contract. Examples of such products and services include one-time license fees, certain derivative financial products, certain implementation services and historical data sets. Based on the nature of the services provided, non-recurring revenues are generally billed either in advance or after delivery and recognized point in time or over the service period.
Operating Expenses
We group our operating expenses into the following activity categories:
•Cost of revenues;
•Selling and marketing;
•Research and development (“R&D”);
•General and administrative (“G&A”);
•Amortization of intangible assets; and
•Depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements.
Costs are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or, when not directly attributable, an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved. Cost of revenues, selling and marketing, R&D and G&A all include both compensation as well as non-compensation related expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues expenses consist of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs, including data center, cloud service, platform and infrastructure costs; costs to acquire, produce and maintain market data information; costs of research to support and maintain existing products; costs of product management teams; costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs; as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources, finance and legal costs.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams, as well as costs incurred in other departments associated with acquiring new business, including product management, research, technology and sales operations.
Research and Development
R&D expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhance existing products and the costs to develop new or enhanced technologies and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development, research, product management, project management and the technology support directly associated with these activities.
General and Administrative
G&A expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations, human resources, office of the CEO, legal, corporate technology, corporate development, impairment charges associated with right of use assets and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed, but are instead allocated, to a product or service.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization of intangible assets expense relates to definite-lived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and capitalization of internally developed software projects. Intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships, proprietary data, trademarks and trade names and technology and software. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. We have no indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Table of Contents
Depreciation and Amortization of Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of computer and related equipment, leasehold improvements, software and furniture and fixtures over the estimated useful life of the assets.
Other Expense (Income), Net
Other expense (income), net consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness, including losses on early extinguishment of debt, income and losses associated with our equity method investment, foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, interest we collect on cash and short-term investments, as well as other non-operating income and expense items that may arise from time to time.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA
“Adjusted EBITDA,” a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as net income before (1) provision for income taxes, (2) other expense (income), net, (3) depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (4) amortization of intangible assets and, at times, (5) certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain non-recurring acquisition-related integration and transaction costs.
“Adjusted EBITDA expenses,” a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain non-recurring acquisition-related integration and transaction costs.
“Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenues.
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA expenses are believed to be meaningful measures for management to assess the operating performance of the Company because they adjust for significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the Company’s ongoing operating performance in the period. All companies do not calculate adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA expenses in the same way. These measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. Accordingly, the Company’s computation of the Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies.
Run Rate
Run Rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our Run Rate ultimately impacts our future operating revenues over time. At the end of any period, we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months. We measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “Run Rate.” See “—Operating Metrics—Run Rate” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.
Subscription Sales
Subscription sales is a key operating metric and is important to management because new subscription sales increase our Run Rate and represent future operating revenues that will be recognized over time. See “—Operating Metrics— Sales” below for additional information.
Retention Rate
Retention Rate is a key operating metric and is important to management because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. See “—Operating Metrics—Retention Rate” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant estimates and judgments made by management include such examples as assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes. We believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded as a result of business combinations undertaken by the Company when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on July 1st and on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist. The test for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level. When testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test; however, on a periodic basis, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. When performing the quantitative test for impairment, we use the income approach to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Estimating discounted future cash flows requires significant management judgment including in estimating forecasted future cash flows and determining both discount rates and terminal growth rates. Forecasted future cash flows are estimated based on a combination of historical experience and assumptions regarding the future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. Discount rates are selected based on discount rates of similar public companies to the reporting unit being valued and terminal growth rates are selected based on consideration of growth rates used during the reporting unit’s forecast period in combination with economic conditions. These assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of the reporting unit’s fair value. Any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. Based on our qualitative assessment for 2022, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the company’s reporting units is less than their respective carrying values and no impairments were recorded.
Definite Lived Intangible Assets
Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances include adverse changes in the manner in which the asset will be used, adverse changes in legal factors related to the asset or negative changes in expected financial performance of the asset, including accumulation of costs and operating losses. Determining whether an event or changes in circumstances warrant an impairment review involves management judgment.
Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, determination of recoverability is determined based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. Measurement of impairment for intangible assets is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows used in the determination and calculation of impairments represent management forecasts and require significant management judgment. While management believes that its forecasts are reasonable, differences between forecasts and actual experience could materially affect the valuations. There were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable during the years presented.
With respect to our acquisition of RCA on September 13, 2021, the valuation of intangible assets, as part of the acquisition method of accounting, was subjective and based, in part, on inputs that were unobservable. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included, forecasted cash flows which were determined based on certain assumptions that included, among others, projected future revenues, and expected market royalty rate, technology obsolescence rates and discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of RCA differently from the allocation that we have made.
We amortize our intangible assets over the estimated period of economic benefit. If the estimated period of economic benefit is changed, the prospective amortization of the intangible asset could materially change.

Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. These laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business. The tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes.
Provision for income taxes is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to estimate future taxable income which requires judgment.
We must regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we file income tax returns and adjust unrecognized tax benefits when additional information is available or when an event occurs. This assessment requires significant judgment in assessment of tax laws, frequency of tax examinations, and the nature of intercompany transactions and tax positions.

Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results
Acquisition of RCA
On September 13, 2021, MSCI completed the acquisition of RCA for an aggregate cash purchase price of $949.0 million, subject to working capital adjustments. See Note 5, “Acquisitions,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on the acquisition of RCA.

Results of Operations
Operating Revenues
Our operating revenues are grouped by the following types: recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring. We also group operating revenues by major product or reportable segment as follows: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate and All Other – Private Assets, which includes the Real Assets product line and our equity method investment in Burgiss.
The following table presents operating revenues by type for the years indicated:

------------------------ ---------------- --------- ---------------- ------- ------------------- --------- ----- - ---- -
 Years Ended
(in thousands) December 31,2022 December 31,2021 Increase/(Decrease)
Recurring subscriptions $ 1,659,523 $ 1,426,040 16.4 %
Asset-based fees 528,127 553,991 (4.7) %
Non-recurring 60,948 63,513 (4.0) %
Total operating revenues $ 2,248,598 $ 2,043,544 10.0 %

Total operating revenues increased 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, total operating revenues would have increased 8.9%.
Operating revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 16.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by strong growth in Index products, which increased $79.1 million, or 12.2%, strong growth in ESG and Climate products, which increased $60.6 million, or 37.2%, strong growth in All Other - Private Assets products, which increased $60.0 million, or 75.4%, and growth in Analytics products, which increased $33.8 million, or 6.3%. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, operating revenues from recurring subscriptions would have increased 14.6%.
Operating revenues from asset-based fees decreased 4.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by a decline in revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes, partially offset by an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to MSCI indexes. Operating revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes decreased by 7.7%, primarily driven by a decrease in average basis point fees and average AUM. Operating revenues from non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes decreased by 6.9%, primarily

Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues increased 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting increases across the All Other - Private Assets, ESG and Climate and Index reportable segments. The change was driven by increases in non-compensation costs, primarily relating to higher information technology costs and professional fees, as well as

39

Table of Contents
increases in compensation and benefit costs, reflecting higher wages and salaries and higher severance costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs.
Selling and Marketing
Selling and marketing expenses increased 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily reflecting increases across the All Other - Private Assets, ESG and Climate and Index segments. The change was primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher wages and salaries, benefits and severance costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. The change was also driven by higher non-compensation costs, primarily related to higher costs associated with conferences and events and travel.
Research and Development
R&D expenses decreased 3.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by increased capitalization of costs related to internally developed software projects. The decrease was partially offset by higher wages and salaries costs, driven by headcount increases, as well as higher non-compensation costs, reflecting increased information technology costs. Taking into consideration investments eligible for capitalization, R&D spending increased across the All Other - Private Assets, ESG and Climate and Index reportable segments, partially offset by decreased spending in the Analytics reportable segment.
General and Administrative
G&A expenses decreased 0.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting decreased spending in the Analytics reportable segment, partially offset by increases across the All Other - Private Assets, ESG and Climate and Index reportable segments. The change was primarily driven by the absence of impairment charges associated with right of use assets and lower transaction costs related to the acquisition of RCA. The decrease was partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs, primarily relating to higher severance costs, wages and salaries and incentive compensation.
The following table presents operating expenses using compensation and non-compensation categories, rather than using activity categories, for the years indicated:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------- --------- ----------------- ------- ------------------- ------- ----- - --- -
 Years Ended
(in thousands) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase/(Decrease)
Compensation and benefits $ 652,364 $ 614,950 6.1 %
Non-compensation expenses 270,622 246,376 9.8 %
Amortization of intangible assets 91,079 80,592 13.0 %
Depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements 26,893 28,901 (6.9) %
Total operating expenses $ 1,040,958 $ 970,819 7.2 %

A significant portion of the incentive compensation component of operating expenses is based on the achievement of a number of financial and operating metrics. In a scenario where operating revenue growth and profitability moderate, incentive compensation would be expected to decrease accordingly.
Fixed costs constitute a significant portion of the non-compensation component of operating expenses. The discretionary non-compensation component of operating expenses could, however, be reduced in the near-term in a scenario where operating revenue growth moderates.
We had 4,759 employees as of December 31, 2022 compared to 4,303 employees as of December 31, 2021, reflecting a 10.6% growth in the number of employees. Continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs. As of December 31, 2022, 65.0% of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 63.2% as of December 31, 2021.
Compensation and benefits costs increased 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in salaries and benefits due to headcount growth and an increase in severance costs, partially offset by increased capitalization of costs related to internally developed software projects and lower incentive compensation.

Table of Contents
Non-compensation expenses increased 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by higher information technology costs, professional fees, market data costs and travel and entertainment expenses, partially offset by lower impairment charges associated with right of use assets, lower non-recurring transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of RCA as well as decreased other non-income tax expenses as a result of favorable settlements reached in the current period.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization of intangible assets expense increased 13.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by additional amortization recognized on acquired intangible assets from the acquisition of RCA, partially offset by the absence of intangible assets write-off costs.
Depreciation and Amortization of Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements decreased 6.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower amortization on software and the lack of impairment charges on leasehold improvements.
Total Other Expense (Income), Net

Other expense (income) 3,997 56,472 (92.9) %
Total other expense (income), net $ 163,799 $ 214,589 (23.7) %

Total other expense (income), net decreased 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by the absence of debt extinguishment costs and higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense associated with higher average outstanding debt balances and by the absence in the current period of a one-time gain of $7.0 million resulting from changes in our ownership interest of Burgiss.
Income Taxes
The following table shows our income tax provision and effective tax rate for the years indicated:

-------------------------- ----------------- ------- ----------------- ---- ------------------- ------- --- - ---- -

Provision for income taxes $ 173,268 $ 132,153 31.1 %
ETR 16.6 % 15.4 % 7.8 %

The effective tax rate of 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $29.1 million, in relation to pretax income, primarily related to $28.4 million of excess tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation vested during the period.
The effective tax rate of 15.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $28.3 million, in relation to pretax income, primarily related to $22.7 million of excess tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation vested during the period, a $5.1 million benefit related to prior year settlements, a $2.3 million benefit related to the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of the enactment of an increase in the UK corporate tax rate and a $2.0 million benefit related to the filing of prior year refund claims, partially offset by a $3.8 million expense related to other prior year items. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by the level of earnings.

Adjusted EBITDA $ 985,407 $ 951,312 3.6 %

Adjusted EBITDA margin % 75.6 % 76.0 %

Index operating revenues increased 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by growth from recurring subscriptions, partially offset by a decline in asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Index operating segment revenues would have increased 4.5%.
Revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 12.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by strong growth from both market cap-weighted and factor, ESG and climate Index products.
Operating revenues from asset-based fees decreased 4.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by a decline in revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes, partially offset by an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to MSCI indexes. Operating revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes decreased by 7.7%, primarily driven by a decrease in average basis point fees and average AUM. Operating revenues from non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes decreased by 6.9%, primarily driven by a decrease in average basis point fees, partially offset by an increase in average AUM. Operating revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to MSCI indexes increased by 15.1%, driven by volume increases.
Index segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 5.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by higher non-compensation expenses across the cost of revenues, R&D and selling and marketing expense categories, primarily relating to higher information technology costs. The change was also driven by higher compensation costs across all expense activity categories, primarily reflecting higher wages and salaries and benefits costs, as a result of increased headcount, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Index segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased 9.9%.

Operating Metrics
Run Rate
“Run Rate” estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements (“Client Contracts”) for the next 12 months, assuming all Client Contracts that come up for renewal, or reach the end of the committed subscription period, are renewed and assuming then-current currency exchange rates, subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below. For any Client Contract where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume/fees, the Run Rate calculation reflects, for ETFs, the market value on the last trading day of the period, for futures and options, the most recent quarterly volumes and/or reported exchange fees, and for other non-ETF products, the most recent client-reported assets. Run Rate does not include fees associated with “one-time” and other non-recurring transactions. In addition, we add to Run Rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales, whether to existing or new clients, when we execute Client Contracts, even though the license start date, and associated revenue recognition, may not be effective until a later date. We remove from Run Rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any Client Contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination, non-renewal or an indication the client does not intend to continue their subscription during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services, even though such notice is not effective until a later date.
Changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in Run Rate. The actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from Run Rate for numerous reasons, including:
•fluctuations in revenues associated with new recurring sales;
•modifications, cancellations and non-renewals of existing Client Contracts, subject to specified notice requirements;
•differences between the recurring license start date and the date the Client Contract is executed due to, for example, contracts with onboarding periods or fee waiver periods;
•fluctuations in asset-based fees, which may result from changes in certain investment products’ total expense ratios, market movements, including foreign currency exchange rates, or from investment inflows into and outflows from investment products linked to our indexes;
•fluctuations in fees based on trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes;
•fluctuations in the number of hedge funds for which we provide investment information and risk analysis to hedge fund investors;

Sales
Sales represents the annualized value of products and services clients commit to purchase from MSCI and will result in additional operating revenues. Non-recurring sales represent the actual value of the customer agreements entered into during the period and are not a component of Run Rate. New recurring subscription sales represent additional selling activities, such as new customer agreements, additions to existing agreements or increases in price that occurred during the period and are additions to Run Rate. Subscription cancellations reflect client activities during the period, such as discontinuing products and services and/or reductions in price, resulting in reductions to Run Rate. Net new recurring subscription sales represent the amount of new recurring subscription sales net of subscription cancellations during the period, which reflects the net impact to Run Rate during the period.
Total gross sales represent the sum of new recurring subscription sales and non-recurring sales. Total net sales represent the total gross sales net of the impact from subscription cancellations.

(1)Includes RCA’s Run Rate commencing as of the acquisition date of September 13, 2021.
(2)Retention rate for All Other – Private Assets excluding the impact of RCA was 92.7% and 92.4% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Retention Rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. The annual Retention Rate represents the retained subscription Run Rate (subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year) as a percentage of the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year.
The Retention Rate for a non-annual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew or discontinue the subscription during the non-annual period, and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement, even though such notice is not effective until a later date. This annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate. This cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100% to derive the annualized Retention Rate for the period.
For example, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded cancellations of $28.1 million. To derive the Retention Rate for the fourth quarter, we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of $28.1 million to derive $112.3 million of annualized cancellations. This $112.3 million was then divided by the $1,614.6 million subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the year to derive a cancellation rate of 7.0%. The 7.0% was then subtracted from 100.0% to derive a Retention Rate of 93.0% for the fourth quarter.
Retention Rate is computed by operating segment on a product/service-by-product/service basis. In general, if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment, or switches between products or services within a segment, we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our Retention Rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service. In those replacement cases, only the net change to the client subscription, if a decrease, is reported as a cancellation. In the Analytics and the ESG and Climate operating segments, substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner, while in our Index and Real Assets operating segments, product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances. In addition, we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down-sell of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction. We do not calculate Retention Rate for that portion of our Run Rate attributable to assets in index-linked investment products or futures and options contracts, in each case, linked to our indexes.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, 36.2% of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter. In our product lines, Retention Rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We require capital to fund ongoing operations, internal growth initiatives and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facility. In addition, we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets. We intend to use these sources of liquidity to, among other things, service our existing and future debt obligations, fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and dividend payments, and make repurchases of our common stock. In connection with our business strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities. We believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth.
Senior Notes and Credit Agreement
As of December 31, 2022, we had an aggregate of $4,200.0 million in Senior Notes outstanding. In addition, under the Credit Agreement, we had as of December 31, 2022: (i) an aggregate of $347.8 million in Tranche A Term Loans outstanding under the TLA Facility and (ii) $500 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our outstanding indebtedness and revolving credit facility.
The Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement are fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by our direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that account for more than 5% of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated assets, other than certain excluded subsidiaries (the “subsidiary guarantors”). Amounts due under the Credit Agreement are our and the subsidiary guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with the Senior Notes and any of our other unsecured, unsubordinated debt, senior to any of our subordinated debt and effectively subordinated to our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt.
The indentures governing our Senior Notes (the “Indentures”) among us, each of the subsidiary guarantors, and Computershare, National Association, as trustee and successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the Indentures restrict our non-guarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such non-guarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the Senior Notes on a pari passu basis.
The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and/or the ability of our existing or future subsidiaries to:
•incur liens and further negative pledges;
•incur additional indebtedness or prepay, redeem or repurchase indebtedness;
•make loans or hold investments;
•merge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate with or into another person;
•enter into acquisition transactions;
•enter into sale/leaseback transactions;
•issue disqualified capital stock;
•pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock or engage in stock repurchases, redemptions and other restricted payments;
•create new subsidiaries;
•permit certain restrictions affecting our subsidiaries;
•change the nature of our business, accounting policies or fiscal periods;
•enter into any transactions with affiliates other than on an arm’s-length basis; and
•amend our organizational documents or amend, modify or change the terms of certain agreements relating to our indebtedness.
The Credit Agreement and the Indentures also contain customary events of default, including those relating to non-payment, breach of representations, warranties or covenants, cross-default and cross-acceleration, and bankruptcy and insolvency events, and, in the case of the Credit Agreement, invalidity or impairment of loan documentation, change of control and customary ERISA defaults in addition to the foregoing. None of the restrictions above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business.

The Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the Credit Agreement: (1) the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis not to exceed 4.25:1.00 (or 4.50:1.00 for two fiscal quarters following a material acquisition) and (2) the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis of at least 4.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2022, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was 3.08:1.00 and our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio was 8.45:1.00.
Our non-guarantor subsidiaries under the Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement consist of: (i) domestic subsidiaries of the Company that account for 5% or less of consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) any foreign or domestic subsidiary of the Company that is deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of Section 957 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $1,363.1 million, or 60.6%, of our total revenue for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2022, approximately $537.4 million, or 44.5%, of our consolidated operating income for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2022, and approximately $1,043.0 million, or 20.9%, of our consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany assets) and $863.5 million, or 14.4%, of our consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2022.
Share Repurchases
In 2022, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of shares of the Company’s common stock in the open market. See Note 11, “Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit),” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program.
As of trade date February 9, 2023, a total of $1,304.4 million of authorization remained available under the share repurchase program. This authorization may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.
Cash Dividends
On September 17, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders. On October 30, 2014, we began paying regular quarterly cash dividends and have paid such dividends each quarter thereafter.
On January 30, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.38 per share for the three months ending March 31, 2023. This reflects an increase of 10.4% over the quarterly cash dividend declared for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The first quarter 2023 dividend is payable on February 28, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on February 17, 2023.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
We typically seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately $225.0 million to $275.0 million for general operating purposes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $344.5 million and $542.2 million, respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. Repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions. We believe the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purposes or other needs, including acquisitions or expansion of our products.
Cash Flows From Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers, partially offset by higher payments for cash expenses, mainly reflecting higher cash compensation and benefits costs, information technology costs, professional fees, market data costs and travel & entertainment costs.
Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation and benefits costs, income taxes, interest expense, information technology costs, professional fees, market data costs and office rent. Historically, the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year.
Cash Flows From Investing Activities
The year-over-year change was primarily driven by the absence of cash outflows associated with acquisitions and equity method investment, partially offset by higher capitalized software development costs.
Cash Flows From Financing Activities
The year-over-year change was primarily driven by the impact of lower proceeds from borrowings and higher share repurchases, partially offset by lower repayments on debt.
We believe that global cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing revolving credit facility and our ability to access bank debt and the capital markets for additional funds, will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this Form 10-K and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In addition, we expect that foreign cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this Form 10-K and for the foreseeable future thereafter.

Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations consist primarily of our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the Senior Notes, Tranche A Term Loans, leases for office space, leases for equipment and other operating leases and obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2022:

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

(6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. The 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...
