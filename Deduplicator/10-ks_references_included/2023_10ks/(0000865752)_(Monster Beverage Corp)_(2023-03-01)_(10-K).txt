Russia-Ukraine Conflict
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Net sales in Russia and Ukraine combined were approximately 1.1% of our total net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. We will continue to monitor future developments relative to this conflict and its potential impacts.
​
The COVID – 19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly impacted our business. The duration and severity of this impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the emergence of new variants, the actions taken to limit its spread and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”
Pricing Actions
In 2022, we implemented measures to mitigate our increased costs through price increases and reductions in promotions (“Pricing Actions”). We implemented a price increase effective September 1, 2022 in the United States and implemented price increases at various times in certain international markets, all of which positively impacted gross profit margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2022.
Distribution and Supply Chain
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent increased demand for our energy drinks, we prioritized ensuring product availability for our customers and consumers. This strategic direction has remained in place throughout the global supply chain challenges and disruptions, despite adversely impacting our profitability. We continue to stand by our strategy to ensure product availability and solidify the continued long-term growth of our brands.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we experienced a significant increase in cost of sales, resulting in a material decrease in both gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales, relative to the comparative year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to (i) increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials and increased co-packing fees, (ii) increased logistical costs, (iii) increased aluminum can costs and (iv) geographical and product sales mix.
In the third and fourth quarters of 2022 we began to see an improvement in our gross profit margins as compared to the second quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily attributable to (i) Pricing Actions, (ii) our decreased reliance on imported cans and (iii) improved finished product inventory levels in closer proximity to our customers, resulting in a reduction of long-distance freight costs.
Furthermore, we experienced significant increases in distribution expenses, primarily the result of increased warehousing expenses, as well as increases in other logistical expenses, which adversely impacted operating costs.
We continue to address the controllable challenges in our supply chain.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of the date of this filing, we expect to maintain substantial liquidity as we manage through the current environment as described in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below.

Value Drivers of our Business
We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following:
 ● International Growth – The introduction, development and sustained profitability of our brands internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. One or more of our products are distributed in approximately 157 countries and territories worldwide.

 ● Profitable Growth – We believe “functional” value-added beverage brands supported by marketing and innovation and targeted to a diverse consumer base, drive profitable growth. We are focused on increasing the profit margins for our Monster Energy® Drinks segment, our Strategic Brands segment and our Alcohol Brands segment, and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth.

 ● Cost Management – The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on mitigating increases and/or reducing input procurement and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees, as well as reducing freight costs by securing additional co-packing facilities strategically localized. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales.

 ● Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is designed to optimize our working capital in order to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe that with our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at a relatively low effective cost of borrowings, provides a competitive advantage. The reduction of days outstanding for accounts receivable and inventory days on hand will remain an area of focus.

We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when implemented and/or achieved in the United States and internationally, will result in: (1) improving or maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) reducing our expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) enhancing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations.
Net sales, gross profit, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2023 and beyond (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations”).
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had working capital of $3.76 billion compared to $3.72 billion as of December 31, 2021. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of the increase in accounts receivable and inventories, related to the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $887.7 million as compared to $1.16 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Principal uses of cash flows in 2022 were purchases of investments, purchases of treasury stock, the acquisition of CANarchy, development of our brands internationally and acquisitions of real property, property and equipment. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See “Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources”).

Opportunities, Challenges and Risks
Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks for the beverage industry and the Company, including our significant commercial relationship with TCCC and TCCC’s status as a significant stockholder of the Company, in each case as described above under “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors.”
In addition, legislation has been proposed and/or adopted at the U.S., state, county and/or municipal level and proposed and/or adopted in certain foreign jurisdictions to restrict the sale of energy and alcohol drinks (including prohibiting the sale of energy and/or alcohol drinks at certain establishments or pursuant to certain governmental programs), limit caffeine and/or alcohol content, require certain product labeling disclosures and/or warnings, impose taxes, limit product sizes or impose age restrictions for the sale of energy and/or alcohol drinks. In addition, articles critical of the caffeine content in energy drinks and their perceived benefits, or alcohol drinks and their misuse or abuse, as well as articles indicating certain health risks of energy or alcohol drinks have been published. The proposal and/or adoption of such legislation and the publication of such articles, or the future proposal and/or adoption of similar legislation or publication of similar articles, may adversely affect our Company.
In addition, uncertainty and/or volatility in our domestic and/or our international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Furthermore, our growth strategy includes expanding our international business, which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations, including the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Consumer discretionary spending also represents a challenge to the successful marketing and sale of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles as well as alcohol consumption continue to represent a challenge.
We recognize that obesity and alcohol abuse and misuse are complex and serious public health problems. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low calorie beverages within our product lines. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. (See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors”).
Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages which have been positively accepted by consumers. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages that meet consumer preferences, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of price, quality, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences.
In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company’s future financial results include, but are not limited to:
 ● the risks associated with the realization of benefits from our relationship with TCCC;

 ● changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products;

 ● economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate;

 ● the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;

 ● maintenance of our brand image, product quality and corporate reputation;

 ● increasing concern over various environmental, human rights and health matters, including obesity, caffeine and/or alcohol consumption and energy and/or alcohol drinks generally, and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns;

 ● profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Competition” and “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Sales and Marketing”);

 ● costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally;

 ● the risks associated with entering into new sectors in the beverage industry, in particular the alcohol beverage sector, and making acquisitions to implement our growth strategy;

 ● increases in costs of raw materials used by us;

 ● restrictions on imports and sources of supply, duties or tariffs, changes in related government regulations and disruptions in the timely import or export of our products and/or ingredients including flavors, flavor ingredients and supplement ingredients, due to port strikes and/or port congestion, delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, related labor issues or other importation impediments;

 ● protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and our continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines;

 ● limitations on available quantities of aluminum cans, other packaging materials and ingredients;

 ● limitations on co-packing availability and in particular, consolidation in the co-packing industry;

 ● increases in ocean and domestic freight rates;

 ● the long-term impact of Brexit on our business in Europe and the United Kingdom;

 ● the imposition of additional regulation, including regulation restricting the sale of energy or alcohol drinks, limiting caffeine or alcohol content in beverages, requiring product labeling and/or warnings, imposing excise taxes and/or sales taxes, and/or limiting product size and/or age restrictions; and

 ● the continuation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic.

See “Part I, Item 1A – Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.
We believe that the following opportunities exist for us:
 ● domestic and international growth potential of our products;

 ● growth potential of the energy drink and alcohol beverage categories, both domestically and internationally;

 ● growth potential of the affordable energy drink category;

 ● planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of increasing sales and/or contributing to higher profitability;

 ● the introduction of new package formats designed to generate strong revenue growth;

 ● package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth;

 ● effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth;

 ● broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets;

 ● launching and/or relaunching our products and new products into new domestic and international markets and channels;

 ● continued focus on reducing our cost base; and

 ● our entry into the alcohol category and development of our alcohol portfolio.

Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment were $353.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $58.7 million, or 19.9% higher than net sales of $294.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Predator® and NOS® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on net sales of approximately $17.2 million for the Strategic Brands segment for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net sales for the Strategic Brands segment on a foreign currency adjusted basis increased 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Net sales for the Alcohol Brands segment were $101.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022). There were no comparative 2021 net sales for the Alcohol Brands segment as the Company completed its acquisition of CANarchy on February 17, 2022.
Net sales for the Other segment were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $3.0 million, or 11.5% lower than net sales of $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Case sales for our energy drink products, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 701.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately 88.2 million cases or 14.4% higher than case sales of 613.4 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2021. The overall average net sales per case for our energy drink products (excluding net sales of Alcohol Brands and Other segments) decreased to $8.82 for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was 1.9% lower than the average net sales per case of $8.99 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the average net sales per case was primarily the result of geographical and product sales mix.
Barrel sales for our craft beers and hard seltzers, in 31 US gallon equivalents, were 0.3 million barrels for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022).

Table of Contents

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 50.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 56.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily the result of increased freight rates and fuel costs, including costs relating to the importation of aluminum cans, increased ingredient and other input costs, including secondary packaging materials, increased aluminum can costs attributable to higher aluminum commodity pricing, increased co-packing fees, production inefficiencies and geographical sales mix.
Operating Expenses
Total operating expenses were $1.59 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $278.8 million, or 21.3% higher than total operating expenses of $1.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.
The comparative operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 included a $16.9 million reversal of amounts previously accrued in connection with an intellectual property claim. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses of $92.9 million, including travel and entertainment, professional service fees (including legal and accounting) and depreciation and amortization, increased out-bound fuel, freight and warehouse costs of $74.3 million, increased selling and marketing expenses of $59.9 million, including sponsorships and endorsements, point of sale, premiums and allocated trade development, and increased payroll expenses of $57.0 million (of which $23.1 million was related to CANarchy). In addition, CANarchy related depreciation and amortization was $8.7 million for year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in distributor termination expenses of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were 25.2% and 23.7%, respectively. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 (pre COVID-19) were $1.12 billion, or 26.6% of net sales.
Operating Income
Operating income was $1.58 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $212.7 million, or 11.8% lower than operating income of $1.80 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 32.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased primarily as a result of the increase in operating expenses as well as the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
Operating income was $316.3 million and $402.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for our operations in EMEA, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.
Operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $1.85 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $140.7 million, or 7.1% lower than operating income of $1.99 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in operating income for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment was primarily the result of an increase in operating expenses as well as a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales.
Operating income for the Strategic Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $197.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $24.0 million, or 13.8% higher than operating income of $173.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in operating income for the Strategic Brands segment was primarily the result of a $30.6 million increase in gross profit.
Operating loss for the Alcohol Brands segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $31.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022). The operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was due in part to (i) excess depreciation and amortization as well as the fair value treatment of purchased inventory, all relating to the CANarchy Transaction, (ii) increased input costs and an underutilization

of fixed overhead and (iii) sales volume declines primarily of Wild BasinTM due in part to overall sales declines in the hard seltzer category. The inventory acquired, which was subsequently sold, was recognized through cost of goods sold at fair value (purchased cost), resulting in no recognized profits on the associated sales.
Operating income for the Other segment, exclusive of corporate and unallocated expenses, was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $3.9 million, or 56.2% lower than operating income of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Other (Expense) Income, net
Other (expense) income, net, was ($12.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to other (expense) income, net, of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were ($37.9) million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Interest income was $29.7 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes was $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $43.6 million, or 10.3% lower than the provision for income taxes of $423.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate was 24.2% and 23.5% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the decrease in income in certain foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates compared to the United States.
Net Income
Net income was $1.19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $185.9 million, or 13.5% lower than net income of $1.38 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the decrease in the gross profit percentage of net sales as well as the increase in operating expenses.
Key Business Metrics
We use certain key metrics and financial measures not prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to evaluate and manage our business. For a further discussion of how we use key metrics and certain non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Metrics” below.

Gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment increased primarily due to increased worldwide sales by volume of our Monster Energy® brand energy drinks as a result of increased consumer demand, as well as due to price increases in certain markets. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on

gross billings for the Monster Energy® Drinks segment of approximately $268.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Gross billings for the Strategic Brands segment were $398.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $58.6 million, or 17.2% higher than gross billings of $340.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on gross billings in the Strategic Brands segment of approximately $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Gross billings for the Alcohol Brands segment were $103.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022). There were no comparative 2021 gross billings for the Alcohol Brands segment as the Company completed its acquisition of CANarchy on February 17, 2022.
Gross billings for the Other segment were $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 11.5% lower than gross billings of $25.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses, as described in the footnote below, were $990.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $65.8 million, or 7.1% higher than promotional allowances, commissions and other expenses of $924.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Promotional allowances as a percentage of gross billings were 13.6% and 14.4% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
**Gross billings represent amounts invoiced to customers net of cash discounts, returns and excise taxes. Gross billings are used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and is useful to investors in evaluating overall Company performance. The use of gross billings allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross billings provides a useful measure of our operating performance. The use of gross billings is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross billings may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross billings has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross billings may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers.

***Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the presentation thereof does not conform to GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products primarily include consideration given to our non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to our bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) our agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities; (iv) our agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to our bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals; (vi) discounted or free products; (vii) contractual fees given to our bottlers/distributors related to sales made by us direct to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) certain commissions paid based on sales to our bottlers/distributors. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances for our energy drink products constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Our promotional allowance programs for our energy drink products with our numerous bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The primary drivers of our promotional and other allowance activities for our energy drink products for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were (i) to increase sales volume and trial, (ii) to address market conditions, and (iii) to secure shelf and display space at retail. Promotional and other allowances for our Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price promotions where permitted.
Sales
The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past three years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.
Sales of our energy drinks are expressed in unit case volume. A “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). Unit case volume means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of finished products or concentrates, as if converted into finished products, sold by us.
Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. Beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. However, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. In addition, our continued growth internationally may further reduce the impact of seasonality on our business. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers/distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses. The

COVID-19 pandemic, including new variants, may also have an impact on consumer behavior and change the seasonal fluctuation of our business. (See “Part I, Item 1 – Business – Seasonality”).

Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on both net sales and the overall average net sales per case for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Unit Sales of our alcohol products are expressed in barrel equivalents (“Barrel”). A Barrel is a unit of measurement equal to 31 U.S. gallons. Barrel sales were 0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 (effectively from February 17, 2022 to December 31, 2022).
Inflation
Inflation had a negative impact on our results of operations, leading to increased cost of sales and operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. To mitigate the impact of inflation, we implemented a price increase effective September 1, 2022 in the United States and continue to implement price increases in certain international markets where feasible.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments – As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.31 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.36 billion in short-term investments and $61.4 million in long-term investments. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Of our $1.31 billion of cash and cash equivalents held at December 31, 2022, $668.9 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. No short-term or long-term investments were held by our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2022.
We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and access to credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of capital assets, purchases of equipment, purchases of real property and purchases of shares of our common stock, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, capital expenditures (exclusive of common stock repurchases) are likely to be less than $300.0 million through December 31, 2023. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate.

Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment (including real property, personal property and coolers), leasehold improvements, advances for or the purchase of equipment for our bottlers, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash.

Accounting Policies and Pronouncements
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. See “Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for a summary of our significant accounting policies.

Table of Contents

The following summarizes our most significant critical accounting estimates:
Goodwill – The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company reasonably determines that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company performs its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins and terminal growth rates. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company will recognize an impairment for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no goodwill impairments recorded and there are no accumulated impairment balances.
Other Intangibles – In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined on a relief from royalty methodology, which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues and terminal growth rates. A significant change in any or a combination of the assumptions used to estimate fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. For the year ended December 31, 2022, an impairment charge of $2.2 million was recorded to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2021 no impairment charges were recorded to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2020, an impairment charge of $8.7 million was recorded to intangibles.
Revenue Recognition – Promotional and other allowances (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales for our energy drink products primarily include consideration given to the Company’s non-alcohol bottlers/distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following:
 ● discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end-consumers by retailers;

 ● reimbursements given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees for both new and existing products;

 ● the Company’s agreed share of fees given to bottlers/distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing and promotional activities;

 ● the Company’s agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances and other fees given directly to retailers;

 ● incentives given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined sales goals;

 ● discounted or free products;

 ● contractual fees given to the Company’s bottlers/distributors related to sales made directly by the Company to certain customers that fall within the bottlers’/distributors’ sales territories; and

 ● commissions paid to TCCC based on our sales to certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of TCCC and/or to certain companies accounted for under the equity method by TCCC.

The Company’s promotional allowance programs for its energy drink products with its bottlers/distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s promotional and other allowances for its energy drink products are calculated based on various programs with bottlers/distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established during the year for its anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.
Promotional and other allowances for the Alcohol Brands segment primarily include price promotions where permitted.
