Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on November 23, 2022.

Net loss (GAAP) from continuing operations fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Fiscal 2023 net loss attributable to the Company was $3.1 billion compared to net earnings of $4.3 billion in the year ago period. Diluted net loss per share was $3.57 compared to diluted net earnings per share of $5.01 in the year ago period. The decrease in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share reflects a $5.5 billion after-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation in the current year and a $2.5 billion after-tax gain on the Company's investments in VillageMD and Shields in the year ago period, partly offset by a $1.7 billion after-tax gain from the partial sale of the Company's investments in Cencora and the complete sale of the Company's investment in Option Care Health.

Operating loss was $6.9 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to operating income of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022. The decrease is primarily driven by a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, and planned payroll investments in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment, partly offset by higher Boots UK intangible assets impairment charges in the year ago period, lower incentive accruals, International segment growth, and improved retail contributions in the U.S.

Other income, net in fiscal 2023 was $2.0 billion compared to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2022. The decrease in other income is mainly due to the gains on the Company's investments in VillageMD and Shields in the year ago period, partly offset by the pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion from the partial sale of the Company's investments in Cencora and full sale of investment in Option Care Health in the current year.

Interest expense, net was $580 million and $400 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher short-term benchmark interest rates and incremental facility borrowings associated with the Summit transaction in the current period.

The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 and 2022 was a benefit of 34.3% and 0.8%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate benefit was primarily attributable to a reduction in the valuation allowance, changes to deferred taxes as a result of internal legal entity restructuring, and tax benefits related to a measurement change in prior year tax positions. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of certain nondeductible charges for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements recorded during fiscal 2023. The Company recognized a tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current year against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in Cencora and other forecasted capital gains. See Note 6. Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Adjusted net earnings attributable to the Company in fiscal 2023 decreased 21.1 percent to $3.4 billion compared with the year ago period. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2023 decreased 20.9 percent to $3.98 compared with the year ago period. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both adversely impacted by 0.6 percentage points as a result of currency translation.

Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2023 primarily reflects a COVID-19 headwind of approximately 21 percent and planned payroll investments in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment, partly offset by lower incentive accruals, improved retail contributions in the U.S., and International growth.

4Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. Comparable retail sales for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.

NM - Not meaningful. Percentage increases above 200% or when one period includes income and other period includes loss are considered not meaningful.

Sales fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Sales for fiscal 2023 increased by 1.1 percent to $110.3 billion. Comparable sales increased by 4.9 percent in fiscal 2023.

Pharmacy sales increased by 2.1 percent in fiscal 2023, and represented 74.4 percent of the segment’s sales. Pharmacy sales were negatively impacted by a 3.5 percentage point headwind from AllianceRx Walgreens. In fiscal 2022, pharmacy sales decreased 5.3 percent and represented 73.7 percent of the segment’s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 7.2 percent in fiscal 2023, aided by higher brand inflation and mix impacts, compared to an increase of 4.7 percent in the year ago period. Within comparable pharmacy sales, 30-day equivalent prescriptions filled in fiscal 2023 increased by 0.6 percent compared to the year ago period. Total prescriptions filled in fiscal 2023, including immunizations, adjusted to 30-day equivalents, decreased 0.4 percent to 1.2 billion, impacted by lower market growth.

Retail sales decreased by 1.6 percent in fiscal 2023 and were 25.6 percent of the segment’s sales. In comparison, fiscal 2022 retail sales increased by 5.6 percent and comprised 26.3 percent of the segment’s sales. Comparable retail sales decreased 0.8 percent in fiscal 2023 and increased 6.1 percent in fiscal 2022.

Operating loss fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Gross profit was $22.1 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $23.7 billion in the year ago period. Gross profit decreased 6.6 percent primarily driven by lower volumes of COVID-19 vaccinations and testing volumes and pharmacy reimbursement pressure net of procurement savings, partly offset by improved retail gross profit driven by gross margin expansion and improved shrink.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 25.1 percent in fiscal 2023 compared to 19.4 percent in fiscal 2022. The increase is primarily driven by the $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, and planned payroll investments, partly offset by cost savings from the Transformational Cost Management Program and lower incentive accruals.

Operating loss for fiscal 2023 was $5.3 billion, including income of $252 million from the Company's share of equity earnings in Cencora. This compared to $2.9 billion of operating income in the year ago period, including, $418 million from Company's share of equity earnings in Cencora. The decrease was primarily driven by a $6.8 billion pre-tax charge for opioid-related claims and litigation settlements, and lower gross profit.

Adjusted operating income fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2023 decreased 26.6 percent to $3.7 billion. The decrease reflects a 23.7 percent headwind from lower COVID-19 vaccination and testing volumes, softness in retail comparable sales and continued reimbursement pressure, partly offset by improved retail contributions, selling, general, and administrative expense discipline and lower inventive accruals.

International
The Company's International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution business in Germany. Pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products.

The International segment operates in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, euro, Chilean peso and Mexican peso and therefore the segment’s results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, for further information on currency risk.

The Company presents certain information related to operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See “--Non-GAAP Measures.”

Sales fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Sales for fiscal 2023 increased 1.7 percent to $22.2 billion. The adverse impact of currency translation on sales was 5.1 percentage points. Sales increased 6.8 percent on a constant currency basis, with Boots UK sales growing 9.0 percent, and Germany wholesale business growing 4.7 percent.

Pharmacy sales decreased 1.7 percent in fiscal 2023 and represented 16.5 percent of the segment’s sales. The adverse impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales was 4.5 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 4.7 percent compared to the year ago period, driven by improved National Health Services (“NHS”) pharmacy funding in the UK and prescription drug inflation in Mexico and Chile, partly offset by lower demand for COVID-19 services.

Retail sales increased 5.8 percent for fiscal 2023 and represented 33.0 percent of the segment’s sales. The adverse impact of currency translation on retail sales was 6.5 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency increased 12.1 percent driven by higher retail sales in the UK, including market share gains, and the impact of the ongoing recovery in store footfall, especially in flagship, destination stores and travel locations, compared to pre-COVID-19 levels.

Pharmaceutical wholesale sales represented 50.5 percent of the segment’s sales. The increase in sales represents market growth in Germany.

Operating income fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Gross profit increased 1.9 percent in fiscal 2023. Gross profit was adversely impacted by 5.4 percentage points or $251 million as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was primarily due to higher retail sales in the UK, solid execution in our Germany wholesale business and the favorable gross margin impact of NHS pharmacy funding in the UK. This was partially offset by lower demand for pharmacy services in the UK.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2023 decreased 12.9 percent from the year ago period to $4.3 billion, including a favorable currency impact of 4.6 percentage points, or $229 million, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease was primarily driven by higher Boots UK intangible asset impairment charges in the year ago period, real estate gains and effective cost management in Germany, and lower acquisition related costs, compared to the year ago period. This was partially offset by increased expenses, driven by higher inflation, increased in-store and marketing activity in the current period, and the lapping of temporary COVID-19 related benefits and sale-leaseback gains in the UK, in the year ago period.

Operating income for fiscal 2023 was $379 million, compared to an operating loss of $346 million in fiscal 2022. Operating income was adversely impacted by 6.4 percentage points or $22 million, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in operating income was driven by higher Boots UK intangible assets impairment charges in the year ago period, execution in Germany, including real estate gains, and strong performance in UK retail sales. This was partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses, driven by higher inflation, increased in-store and marketing activity in the current period and sale-leaseback gains in the UK in the year ago period.

Adjusted operating income fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2023 increased $209 million to $935 million. Adjusted operating income was adversely impacted by 3.7 percentage points, or $27 million, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted operating income was driven by strong growth in UK retail sales and execution in Germany, including real estate gains, and the favorable gross margin impact of NHS pharmacy funding, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and lower demand for COVID-19 related services in the UK.

Sales fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Sales for fiscal 2023 were $6.6 billion, an increase of $4.8 billion compared to the year ago period primarily due to the acquisition of Summit and CareCentrix, which were not included in the year ago period. This is reflective of VillageMD sales of $4.6 billion inclusive of Summit, which closed January 3, 2023, Shields sales of $468 million, and CareCentrix sales of $1.5 billion. Sales for fiscal 2022 were $1.8 billion. This included VillageMD sales of $1.5 billion reflecting ownership since the acquisition date of November 24, 2021 and Shields sales of $286 million reflecting ownership since the acquisition date of October 29, 2021.

Operating loss fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Gross profit for fiscal 2023 was $252 million compared to a loss of $22 million in the fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of CareCentrix which was not included in the year ago period and a positive Shields contribution, partially offset by VillageMD expansion.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.0 billion for fiscal 2023 compared to $806 million in fiscal 2022. The increase was driven by the acquisitions of CareCentrix and Summit, which were not included in the year ago period, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and VillageMD clinic expansion.

Operating loss for fiscal 2023 was $1.7 billion compared to a loss of $829 million in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses for VillageMD and the acquisition of Summit.

Adjusted operating loss for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Adjusted operating loss was $566 million for fiscal 2023, compared to a loss of $370 million in fiscal 2022. The current period represents a full year of VillageMD, Shields, and CareCentrix results compared to a partial period of VillageMD and Shields in the year ago period. The increase in loss is mainly driven by VillageMD clinic expansion and lower CityMD visit volume due to a weaker respiratory season. This was partly offset by positive contributions from Shields and CareCentrix, and cost management at Walgreens Health.

Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure) for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $376 million for fiscal 2023, compared to a loss of $312 million in fiscal 2022. The lower adjusted EBITDA in the current period is mainly driven by VillageMD clinic expansion and the acquisition of Summit which was not in the year ago period. This was partly offset by positive contributions from Shields and CareCentrix, and cost management at Walgreens Health.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the SEC rules, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures herein, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. See notes to the “ Net (loss) earnings to Adjusted net earnings & Diluted net (loss) earnings per share to Adjusted diluted net earnings per share” and “Operating loss to Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. Healthcare segment” reconciliation tables for definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and related adjustments presented below.

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein.

The Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in “constant currency”, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

 1 Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements relate to significant charges associated with certain legal proceedings, including legal defense costs. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded charges related to the opioid litigation settlement frameworks and certain other legal matters. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded charges related to a settlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Company’s pharmacies in the State of Florida.
 2 Transformational Cost Management Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity.
 3 Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities.
 4 Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in operating income within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance, stock compensation and employee transaction success bonuses. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company’s current operating performance.
 5 Impairment of intangible assets do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. In fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a $431 million impairment of pharmacy license intangible assets in Boots UK of which $132 million was attributed to additional store closures recognized as part of the Transformational Cost Management Program. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $783 million, related to indefinite-lived pharmacy license and trade name intangible assets in the Boots reporting unit, part of the International segment.
 6 Adjustments to equity earnings in Cencora consist of the Company’s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by Cencora consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP measures.
 7 The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items.
 8 Store damage and inventory loss insurance recovery for losses incurred in fiscal 2020 as a result of looting in the U.S.
 9 Impairment of equity method investment and investments in debt and equity securities includes impairment of certain investments. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because these do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business and it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis. Exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Other income, net.
10 Includes gains or losses related to the sale of businesses. These charges are recorded to Other income, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a net gain of $322 million within results of discontinued operations related to the sale of the Alliance Healthcare business. These amounts were excluded as it is not reflective of normal operating activities.
11 Includes fair value gains or losses on the variable prepaid forward derivatives and certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within Other income, net. The Company does not believe this volatility related to the mark-to-market adjustments on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company’s operational performance.
12 Includes significant gains resulting from the change in classification of investments as well as fair value adjustments recorded on investments in equity securities to Other income, net. In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $109 million related to the change in classification of its previously held equity method investment in Option Care Health to an investment in equity security held at fair value and subsequent related fair value adjustments. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $2.2 billion and $402 million for VillageMD and Shields, respectively, related to the change in classification of previously held minority equity interests and debt securities to fair value on business combinations. These gains were recorded in Other income, net.
13 In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded gains within Other income, net within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings resulting from the partial sale of its investment in Cencora and full sale of its equity method investment in Option Care Health. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a gain on the partial sale of its investment in Option Care Health.
14 In fiscal 2022, the Company incurred a $4 million loss in connection with the early extinguishment of debt related to the integration of Shields. In fiscal 2021, the Company incurred a $419 million loss related to the Company's cash tender offers to partially purchase and retire $3.3 billion of long-term U.S. denominated notes. The Company excludes these charges as related activities do not reflect the Company’s ongoing financial performance.
15 Adjustments to income tax (benefit) provision include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax (benefit) provision commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including UK tax law changes and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within income tax (benefit) provision.

16 Adjustments to post-tax earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post-tax earnings from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. In fiscal 2021, due to partial sales of ownership interests in Option Care Health, our then equity method investee HC Group Holdings lost the ability to control Option Care Health and, therefore, deconsolidated Option Care Health in its financial statements. As a result of this deconsolidation, HC Group Holdings recognized a gain of $1.2 billion and the Company recorded its share of equity earnings in HC Group Holdings of $576 million.
17 Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted net loss per common share in fiscal 2023.
18 Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes in fiscal 2023.
19 The Company reconciles Adjusted EBITDA for the U.S. Healthcare segment to Operating loss as the closest GAAP measure for the segment profitability. The Company does not measure Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. for its segments.
20 Includes GAAP stock-based compensation expense excluding expenses related to acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs.

The Company considers certain metrics presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as comparable sales (in constant currency), comparable pharmacy sales (in constant currency), comparable retail sales (in constant currency), comparable number of prescriptions and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company's long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company’s dividend policy to set forth the Company’s current intention to increase its dividend each year. The Company has paid cash dividends every quarter since 1933. However, the Company is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and meet its obligations. If the Company’s subsidiaries’ financial performance and earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to the Company while maintaining adequate capital levels, the Company may reduce or may not be able to make dividend payments to its stockholders. Future dividends will be determined based on earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other debt obligations, fines and/or adverse rulings by courts or arbitrators in legal or regulatory matters, changes in federal, state or foreign income tax law, adverse global macroeconomic conditions, changes to the Company’s business model and other factors considered relevant by the Company's Board of Directors at its sole discretion. For further information regarding the Company’s dependence on its subsidiaries to pay dividends and meet its obligations, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk factors.

The Company’s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Company's cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by adverse global macroeconomic conditions caused by factors including, among others, inflation, high interest rates, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and pandemics like COVID-19. For further information regarding the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions on the Company, including on its liquidity and capital resources, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk factors.

The Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, dividend payments, stock repurchases and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements, debt offerings, sale of marketable securities, current cash, and monetization of investments and other assets. As of August 31, 2023, the Company had an aggregate borrowing capacity under committed revolving credit facilities of $6.8 billion, with no funds drawn under these facilities. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds to meet the Company's needs for at least the next 12 months. See Part II, Item 7A, Qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk, for a discussion of certain financing and market risks. See Note 8. Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information on the Company’s debt instruments and its recent financing actions.

Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash were $856 million (including $144 million in non-U.S. jurisdictions) and $2.6 billion (including $188 million in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds.

As of August 31, 2023, the Company has recorded a $7.0 billion liability to resolve a substantial majority of opioid-related claims and litigation settlements and is expected to make payments for remediation and legal fees over the next 15 years. See Note 11. Commitments and contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein for further information.

At August 31, 2023, the Company's letters of credit issued and guarantees outstanding were not material.

Cash flows from operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.3 billion, $3.9 billion and $5.6 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is primarily driven by lower earnings and, opioid related legal settlement payments, partially offset by changes in net working capital. Changes in net working capital are primarily driven by lower cash outflows from inventories, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and income taxes, partially offset by lower cash inflows from accounts receivable.

Cash flows from investing activities
Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities was $(3.1) billion, $(1.1) billion and $4.1 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

------------------------- --
WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 56

Discontinued operations — — 67
Total additions to property, plant and equipment $ 2,117 $ 1,734 $ 1,379

The increase in capital expenditures was primarily driven by maintenance and growth capital projects, including growth initiatives in the U.S. Healthcare segment, including VillageMD clinic expansion.

Cash flows from financing activities
Net cash used for financing activities was $887 million, $1.5 billion and $9.0 billion in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, proceeds from debt, primarily from revolving credit facilities, commercial paper and the issuance of notes, were $6.3 billion, $11.9 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 payments of debt, primarily for revolving credit facilities and commercial paper, were $9.0 billion, $8.4 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively.

In fiscal 2023, the Company acquired $1.3 billion of non-controlling interests related to the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Shields and CareCentrix. In fiscal 2022, the Company acquired $2.1 billion of non-controlling interests primarily related to the acquisition of VillageMD. Financing activities in fiscal 2023 include $2.7 billion in proceeds from the issuance of preferred units in VillageMD to Cigna Health & Life Insurance Company, as part of the Summit acquisition and subsequent exercise of tranche rights. See Note 3. Acquisitions and other investments to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

In fiscal 2023, the Company also entered into VPF transactions with third-party financial institutions and received prepayments of $2.6 billion related to the forward sale of up to 17.3 million shares of Cencora common stock. See Note 6. Equity method investments and Note 9. Financial instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

The Company purchased treasury shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $150 million, $187 million and $110 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. The Company did not repurchase stock pursuant to the stock repurchase programs described below.

Cash dividends paid were $1.7 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.

------------------------- --
WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 57

Table of Contents
Financing activities in fiscal 2022 include early debt extinguishment of $1.6 billion driven by the early redemption of the $731 million 3.100% notes due 2022 and early extinguishments of $458 million and $402 million of the debt related to the integration of Shields and CareCentrix, respectively. Financing activities in fiscal 2021 includes the partial purchase and retirement of $3.3 billion of long-term debt. See Note 8. Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

Stock repurchase program
In June 2018, the Company's Board of Director's approved a stock repurchase program (the “June 2018 stock repurchase program”), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock of which the Company had repurchased $8.0 billion as of August 31, 2023. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company suspended repurchases under this program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans.

The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when we otherwise might be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws.

Debt covenants
Each of the Company’s credit facilities described in Note 8. Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. As of August 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all such applicable financial covenants.

Credit ratings

----------------- --------------------- ---------------------- --------
Rating agency Long-term debt rating Commercialpaper rating Outlook
Moody’s Baa3 P-3 Negative
Standard & Poor’s BBB A-2 Negative

In assessing the Company’s credit strength, each rating agency considers various factors including the Company’s business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. The Company’s credit ratings impact its borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Company’s debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The information set forth in Note 11. Commitments and contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and post-retirement benefits, contingencies and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:

------------------------- --
WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 58

Table of Contents
Business combinations – The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.

For intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.

Judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life.

Leases - The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. Lease commencement is the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term.

The lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Company’s economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.

The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building.

Finance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other non-current liabilities.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment – Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company’s impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping, as well as recent guideline transactions.

------------------------- --

Table of Contents
The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the Company’s reporting units. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. The Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Company’s fair value as implied by the market value of its equity. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company’s equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as the Company's profitability. The Company continues to monitor these potential impacts and economic, industry and market trends, and the impact these may have on the reporting units.

Impairment of long lived assets – The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at the store level for retail pharmacy operations. Long-lived assets related to the Company’s retail pharmacy operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, and right of use assets. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using the income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.

The determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.

Cost of sales and inventory

Retail, Pharmacy and Wholesale
Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts, vendor allowances and supplier rebates. Cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts.

The Company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis. Inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, and distribution costs of products, and are reduced by vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense. The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. The Company’s International segment inventory is accounted for using average cost and the first-in-first-out (“FIFO”) method.

Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors’ products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Allowances received for promoting vendors’ products, if received for a specific, incremental, identifiable cost, are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of Selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier’s products purchased by the Company.

Healthcare services
For operations and activities related to the provision of healthcare, cost of services includes activities that are directly related to the provision of care, including medical claims expense, cost of care, clinic operating and support costs, and allocated depreciation and amortization.

Medical claims expense represents medical claims expenses related to fee-for-service and value-based arrangements and primarily includes costs for third-party healthcare service providers, including contracted providers, that provide medical care to patients. Medical claims expense and the liability for unpaid claims include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services that have been rendered by third parties for which the Company is contractually obligated to pay, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) utilizing actuarial models when a sufficient amount of medical claims history is available from the third-party healthcare service providers. In developing its unpaid claims liability estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated.

Cost of care represents the cost of employed providers and certain affiliated providers, including base compensation, quality incentive bonuses, provider benefits and share-based compensation. Clinic operating and support costs include costs incurred to operate clinics, including clinical care support staff, patient support staff, population health management employees, rent, utilities and supplies.

Equity method investments – The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company’s ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions.

The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified.

Pension and post-retirement benefits – The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a post-retirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and post-retirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.

The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The post-retirement healthcare plan is not funded.

Contingencies – The Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company’s assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in a future fiscal period. Management’s assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management’s assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.

Income taxes –The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the U.S. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill.

16 Adjustments to post-tax earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post-tax earnings from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. In fiscal 2021, due to partial sales of ownership interests in Option Care Health, our then equity method investee HC Group Holdings lost the ability to control Option Care Health and, therefore, deconsolidated Option Care Health in its financial statements. As a result of this deconsolidation, HC Group Holdings recognized a gain of $1.2 billion and the Company recorded its share of equity earnings in HC Group Holdings of $576 million.
17 Due to the anti-dilutive effect resulting from the reported net loss, the impact of potentially dilutive securities on the per share amounts has been omitted from the calculation of weighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted net loss per common share in fiscal 2023.
18 Includes impact of potentially dilutive securities in the calculation of weighted-average common shares, diluted for adjusted diluted net earnings per common share calculation purposes in fiscal 2023.
19 The Company reconciles Adjusted EBITDA for the U.S. Healthcare segment to Operating loss as the closest GAAP measure for the segment profitability. The Company does not measure Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. for its segments.
20 Includes GAAP stock-based compensation expense excluding expenses related to acquisition-related amortization and acquisition-related costs.

The Company considers certain metrics presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as comparable sales (in constant currency), comparable pharmacy sales (in constant currency), comparable retail sales (in constant currency), comparable number of prescriptions and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

2Comparable sales in constant currency are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. Comparable sales in constant currency exclude wholesale sales in Germany. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency refer to total sales, pharmacy sales and retail sales, respectively. The method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.

NM - Not meaningful. Percentage increases above 200% or when one period includes income and other period includes loss are considered not meaningful.

Sales fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Sales for fiscal 2023 increased 1.7 percent to $22.2 billion. The adverse impact of currency translation on sales was 5.1 percentage points. Sales increased 6.8 percent on a constant currency basis, with Boots UK sales growing 9.0 percent, and Germany wholesale business growing 4.7 percent.

Pharmacy sales decreased 1.7 percent in fiscal 2023 and represented 16.5 percent of the segment’s sales. The adverse impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales was 4.5 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 4.7 percent compared to the year ago period, driven by improved National Health Services (“NHS”) pharmacy funding in the UK and prescription drug inflation in Mexico and Chile, partly offset by lower demand for COVID-19 services.

Retail sales increased 5.8 percent for fiscal 2023 and represented 33.0 percent of the segment’s sales. The adverse impact of currency translation on retail sales was 6.5 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency increased 12.1 percent driven by higher retail sales in the UK, including market share gains, and the impact of the ongoing recovery in store footfall, especially in flagship, destination stores and travel locations, compared to pre-COVID-19 levels.

Pharmaceutical wholesale sales represented 50.5 percent of the segment’s sales. The increase in sales represents market growth in Germany.

Operating income fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Gross profit increased 1.9 percent in fiscal 2023. Gross profit was adversely impacted by 5.4 percentage points or $251 million as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was primarily due to higher retail sales in the UK, solid execution in our Germany wholesale business and the favorable gross margin impact of NHS pharmacy funding in the UK. This was partially offset by lower demand for pharmacy services in the UK.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2023 decreased 12.9 percent from the year ago period to $4.3 billion, including a favorable currency impact of 4.6 percentage points, or $229 million, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease was primarily driven by higher Boots UK intangible asset impairment charges in the year ago period, real estate gains and effective cost management in Germany, and lower acquisition related costs, compared to the year ago period. This was partially offset by increased expenses, driven by higher inflation, increased in-store and marketing activity in the current period, and the lapping of temporary COVID-19 related benefits and sale-leaseback gains in the UK, in the year ago period.

Operating income for fiscal 2023 was $379 million, compared to an operating loss of $346 million in fiscal 2022. Operating income was adversely impacted by 6.4 percentage points or $22 million, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in operating income was driven by higher Boots UK intangible assets impairment charges in the year ago period, execution in Germany, including real estate gains, and strong performance in UK retail sales. This was partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses, driven by higher inflation, increased in-store and marketing activity in the current period and sale-leaseback gains in the UK in the year ago period.

Adjusted operating income fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Adjusted operating income for fiscal 2023 increased $209 million to $935 million. Adjusted operating income was adversely impacted by 3.7 percentage points, or $27 million, as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted operating income was driven by strong growth in UK retail sales and execution in Germany, including real estate gains, and the favorable gross margin impact of NHS pharmacy funding, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and lower demand for COVID-19 related services in the UK.

Sales fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Sales for fiscal 2023 were $6.6 billion, an increase of $4.8 billion compared to the year ago period primarily due to the acquisition of Summit and CareCentrix, which were not included in the year ago period. This is reflective of VillageMD sales of $4.6 billion inclusive of Summit, which closed January 3, 2023, Shields sales of $468 million, and CareCentrix sales of $1.5 billion. Sales for fiscal 2022 were $1.8 billion. This included VillageMD sales of $1.5 billion reflecting ownership since the acquisition date of November 24, 2021 and Shields sales of $286 million reflecting ownership since the acquisition date of October 29, 2021.

Operating loss fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Gross profit for fiscal 2023 was $252 million compared to a loss of $22 million in the fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of CareCentrix which was not included in the year ago period and a positive Shields contribution, partially offset by VillageMD expansion.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.0 billion for fiscal 2023 compared to $806 million in fiscal 2022. The increase was driven by the acquisitions of CareCentrix and Summit, which were not included in the year ago period, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and VillageMD clinic expansion.

Operating loss for fiscal 2023 was $1.7 billion compared to a loss of $829 million in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses for VillageMD and the acquisition of Summit.

Adjusted operating loss for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Adjusted operating loss was $566 million for fiscal 2023, compared to a loss of $370 million in fiscal 2022. The current period represents a full year of VillageMD, Shields, and CareCentrix results compared to a partial period of VillageMD and Shields in the year ago period. The increase in loss is mainly driven by VillageMD clinic expansion and lower CityMD visit volume due to a weaker respiratory season. This was partly offset by positive contributions from Shields and CareCentrix, and cost management at Walgreens Health.

Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP measure) for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022
Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $376 million for fiscal 2023, compared to a loss of $312 million in fiscal 2022. The lower adjusted EBITDA in the current period is mainly driven by VillageMD clinic expansion and the acquisition of Summit which was not in the year ago period. This was partly offset by positive contributions from Shields and CareCentrix, and cost management at Walgreens Health.

See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the SEC rules, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures herein, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. See notes to the “ Net (loss) earnings to Adjusted net earnings & Diluted net (loss) earnings per share to Adjusted diluted net earnings per share” and “Operating loss to Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. Healthcare segment” reconciliation tables for definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and related adjustments presented below.

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein.

The Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in “constant currency”, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the U.S. reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and such presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

 1 Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements relate to significant charges associated with certain legal proceedings, including legal defense costs. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In fiscal 2023, the Company recorded charges related to the opioid litigation settlement frameworks and certain other legal matters. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded charges related to a settlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Company’s pharmacies in the State of Florida.
 2 Transformational Cost Management Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity.
 3 Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. The stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities.
 4 Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in operating income within the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance, stock compensation and employee transaction success bonuses. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company’s current operating performance.
 5 Impairment of intangible assets do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. In fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a $431 million impairment of pharmacy license intangible assets in Boots UK of which $132 million was attributed to additional store closures recognized as part of the Transformational Cost Management Program.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The information set forth in Note 11. Commitments and contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and post-retirement benefits, contingencies and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:

------------------------- --
WBA Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 58

Table of Contents
Business combinations – The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.

For intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.

Judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life.

Leases - The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. Lease commencement is the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company']:
