ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

--------
OVERVIEW

VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF” or the "Company”) is a global leader in the design, procurement, marketing and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear and accessories. VF’s diverse portfolio meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on four drivers — find and amplify consumer tailwinds, build brands on multiple growth horizons, leverage platforms for speed to scale and efficiency, and resource for portfolio agility and performance.
VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, apparel,

backpack, luggage and accessories categories. Our products are marketed to consumers through our wholesale channel, primarily in specialty stores, national chains, mass merchants, department stores, independently-operated partnership stores and with strategic digital partners. Our products are also marketed to consumers through our own direct-to-consumer operations, which include VF-operated stores, concession retail stores, brand e-commerce sites and other digital platforms.
VF is organized by groupings of brands and businesses represented by its reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. The three reportable segments are Outdoor, Active and Work.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

VF operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year. All references to the years ended March 2023 ("Fiscal 2023"), March 2022 ("Fiscal 2022") and March 2021 ("Fiscal 2021") relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended April 1, 2023 and April 2, 2022, and the 53-week fiscal year ended April 3, 2021, respectively.
The following discussion and analysis focuses on our financial results for the years ended March 2023 and 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between these years. A discussion of our results of operations for the year ended March 2022 compared to the year ended March 2021 is included in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 2, 2022, filed with the SEC on May 26, 2022, and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. All percentages shown in the tables below and the discussion that follows have been calculated using unrounded numbers.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Executive Leadership Transition
On December 2, 2022, the Board of Directors appointed Benno Dorer, a member of the Board, as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective immediately. In addition, Richard Carucci, a member of the Board, was appointed as Interim Chair of the Board on the same date. Mr. Dorer and Mr. Carucci succeed Steve Rendle, who, by mutual agreement with the Board, retired as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chair of the Board on the same date. The Company's search for a permanent successor to the President and Chief Executive Officer role is ongoing.
Dividend Update
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share that was paid during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, which represented a 41% reduction when compared to the dividend of $0.51 per share paid in the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. The decrease in the dividend was an action taken to strengthen the Company's financial position, accelerate the return to target leverage ratios and provide additional financial flexibility to navigate the current macroeconomic challenges and maintain investments to advance its greatest value creation opportunities. On May 16, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share that is payable during the first quarter of Fiscal 2024. Subject to approval by its Board of Directors, VF intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends.
Macroeconomic Environment
The macroeconomic environment continues to dynamically evolve. Global trends, including inflationary pressures, are weakening consumer sentiment, negatively impacting consumer spending behavior and creating variable traffic patterns across channels. These conditions have led to elevated inventories in certain markets and an increased promotional environment. Additionally, the strong U.S. dollar has resulted in unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes, which have significantly impacted the results of our international businesses. The Company is also operating in a higher interest rate environment, resulting in increased borrowing costs. There is ongoing uncertainty around the global economy and macroeconomic environment, which we expect to continue and may cause disruption and near-term challenges for our business.

Russia-Ukraine Conflict
In response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, all VF-operated retail locations within Russia are permanently closed. Limited wholesale shipments to both Russia and Ukraine have resumed. Revenues in Russia and Ukraine represented less than 1% of VF's total Fiscal 2023 revenue. While we are not able to determine the ultimate length and severity of the conflict, we currently do not expect significant disruption to our business.
Impact of COVID-19 and Supply Chain Update
The coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic has significantly impacted global economic conditions, as well as VF's business operations and financial performance, which continued into Fiscal 2023.
VF-operated retail stores across the globe were impacted due to COVID-19, including temporary closures for varying periods. In Fiscal 2023, the impacts were most notable in the Asia-Pacific region, including Mainland China. VF is continuing to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak globally and will comply with guidance from government entities and public health authorities to prioritize the health and well-being of its employees, customers, trade partners and consumers. As COVID-19 uncertainty continues, retail store closures may recur.
COVID-19 also impacted some of VF's suppliers, including raw material suppliers, third-party manufacturers, logistics providers and other vendors. The resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns in key sourcing countries resulted in additional manufacturing capacity constraints and logistical challenges during Fiscal 2023. VF worked with its suppliers to minimize disruption and employed expedited freight as needed. Although the situation has improved over time, lead times across the supply chain coupled with higher volatility on the distribution and logistics network, particularly in the Americas, and event-driven spikes in demand, led to inconsistent on-time delivery performance and higher cancellations with our wholesale partners and inefficiencies in support of our direct-to-consumer business during certain timeframes in Fiscal 2023.
VF's distribution centers are operational in accordance with local government guidelines.
The COVID-19 pandemic is dynamic in nature and may result in ongoing disruption to our business.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Statements of Operations

The following table presents a summary of the changes in net revenues for the year ended March 2023 compared to the year ended March 2022:

-------------------------- ---------------- --------
(In millions) Year Ended March
Net revenues — 2022 $ 11,841.8
Organic 331.6

Impact of foreign currency (560.9)
Net revenues — 2023 $ 11,612.5

Year Ended March 2023 Compared to Year Ended March 2022

VF reported a 2% decrease in revenues in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022. The revenue decrease was primarily driven by declines in the Active segment and a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency in the year ended March 2023. Revenues in the Active segment during Fiscal 2023 were impacted by weakness in the Americas region, primarily driven by declines in the Vans® brand. Revenues in the Active segment during the year ended March 2023 were also impacted by declines in the Asia-

Pacific region, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19 resurgence that caused disruption and consumption pressure in the region, particularly in Mainland China. The revenue decrease in Fiscal 2023 was also due to declines in the Work segment. The decrease in Fiscal 2023 was partially offset by global growth in the Outdoor segment driven by increases in The North Face® brand across all regions and broad-based operational strength in the Europe region.
Additional details on revenues are provided in the section titled “Information by Reportable Segment”.

Table of Contents

Year Ended March 2023 Compared to Year Ended March 2022
Gross margin decreased 200 basis points to 52.5% in Fiscal 2023 compared to 54.5% in Fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin in Fiscal 2023 was driven by increased discounts and other promotional activity, and higher material and labor costs, partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 270 basis points in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $210.7 million in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022, including the impact of a $150.0 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the Supreme acquisition, which reduced selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended March 2022. The increase was also due to higher corporate restructuring charges and investments in information technology.
VF recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $394.1 million and $340.9 million, respectively, in the year ended March 2023 related to the Supreme reporting unit. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, due to continued increases in the federal funds rate and strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, VF determined that a triggering event had occurred requiring a quantitative analysis of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. As a result of the impairment testing performed, VF recorded impairment charges of $229.0 million and $192.9 million to the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, respectively. The impairment primarily related to an increase in the market-based discount rates used in the valuations and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on financial projections. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, in connection with its annual impairment testing, VF performed a quantitative analysis of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. As a result of the impairment testing performed, VF recorded additional impairment charges of $165.1 million and $148.0 million to the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, respectively. The impairment related to lower financial projections and increased risk of achieving management's forecasts.
In Fiscal 2023, operating margin decreased to 2.8% from 13.8% in Fiscal 2022, primarily due to the items described above.
Net interest expense increased $33.2 million to $164.6 million in Fiscal 2023. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to higher short-term commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the delayed draw Term Loan Agreement (the

"DDTL Agreement") and an increase in borrowing rates. The increase was partially offset by repayment of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal of the 2.050% Senior Notes due April 2022. Total outstanding interest-bearing debt averaged $6.2 billion and $5.6 billion for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, respectively, with short-term borrowings representing 16.8% and 1.1% of average debt outstanding for the respective years. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was 2.6% in Fiscal 2023 and 2.1% in Fiscal 2022.
Loss on debt extinguishment of $3.6 million was recorded in Fiscal 2022 as a result of the early redemption of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of VF's outstanding 2.050% Senior Notes due April 2022.
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of components of net periodic pension cost (excluding the service cost component), certain foreign currency and hedging gains and losses and other non-operating gains and losses. Other income (expense) netted to $(119.8) million and $26.2 million in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, respectively. Other income (expense), net in Fiscal 2023 included a $91.8 million pension settlement charge, which resulted from the purchase of a group annuity contract and transfer of a portion of the assets and liabilities associated with the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan to an insurance company and $23.0 million of foreign currency and hedging losses. Other income (expense), net in Fiscal 2022 included $21.6 million of net periodic pension income driven by the expected return on plan assets and a $6.8 million gain related to certain insurance recoveries.
The effective income tax rate was (174.0)% in Fiscal 2023 compared to 20.2% in Fiscal 2022. The Fiscal 2023 effective income tax rate included a net discrete tax benefit of $96.8 million, which primarily related to the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") examinations for tax year 2017 and short-tax year 2018 resulting in a $94.9 million favorable adjustment to VF's transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. Tax Act"). The $96.8 million net discrete tax benefit in Fiscal 2023 decreased the effective income tax rate by 223.5% compared to an unfavorable 6.9% impact of discrete items for Fiscal 2022. Excluding discrete items, the effective tax rate during Fiscal 2023 increased by approximately 36.2% primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of earnings and goodwill impairment in Fiscal 2023.
As a result of the above, income from continuing operations in Fiscal 2023 was $118.6 million ($0.31 per diluted share), compared to $1.2 billion ($3.10 per diluted share) in Fiscal 2022.

Reconciliation of Segment Profit to Consolidated Income Before Income Taxes

There are four types of costs necessary to reconcile total segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes. These costs are (i) impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which is excluded from segment profit because these costs are not part of the ongoing operations of the respective businesses, (ii) corporate and other expenses, which are excluded from segment profit to the extent they are not allocated to the segments, (iii) interest expense, net, and (iv) loss on debt

extinguishment, which are excluded from segment profit because substantially all financing costs are managed at the corporate office and are not under the control of segment management. Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, net interest expense and loss on debt extinguishment are discussed in the “Consolidated Statements of Operations” section, and corporate and other expenses are discussed below.

-------------------------------------------- ---------------- ----- ---- ----- - -
 Year Ended March

(In millions) 2023 2022
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets $ 735.0 $ —
Corporate and other expenses 617.8 309.8
Interest expense, net 164.6 131.5
Loss on debt extinguishment — 3.6

Corporate and other expenses are those that have not been allocated to the segments for internal management reporting, including (i) information systems and shared service costs, (ii) corporate headquarters costs, and (iii) certain other income and expenses.
Information Systems and Shared Services
These costs include management information systems and the centralized finance, supply chain and human resources functions that support worldwide operations. The costs also include software system implementations and upgrades and other strategic projects. Operating costs of information systems and shared services are charged to the segments based on utilization of those services. Costs to develop new software and related applications are generally not allocated to the segments.
Corporate Headquarters’ Costs
Headquarters’ costs include compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, legal and professional fees, and general and administrative expenses that have not been allocated to the segments.

Other
This category includes (i) costs of corporate programs or corporate-managed decisions that are not allocated to the segments, (ii) costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of VF’s trademarks, and (iii) miscellaneous consolidated activities, the most significant of which is related to VF’s centrally-managed U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
Corporate and other expenses increased $308.0 million in Fiscal 2023 when compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in corporate restructuring charges of $61.0 million, an increase in information technology costs of $38.8 million and a $91.8 million pension settlement charge recorded in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. Additionally, the increase in the year ended March 2023 when compared to the 2022 period was driven by a $150.0 million decrease in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the Supreme acquisition, which reduced expenses in the year ended March 2022. The increase in Fiscal 2023 was partially offset by lower employee compensation expenses compared to Fiscal 2022.

International Operations

International revenues decreased 2% in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022. Foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 10% on international revenues in Fiscal 2023.
Revenues in the Europe region were flat in Fiscal 2023, driven by a 12% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. In the Asia-Pacific region, revenues decreased 7% in Fiscal 2023, including

an 8% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. Revenues in Greater China decreased 14% in Fiscal 2023, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19 resurgence in Mainland China and included a 7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency.
International revenues were 48% of total VF revenues in both Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022.

-----------------------------
Direct-to-Consumer Operations

Direct-to-consumer revenues decreased 3% in Fiscal 2023 over Fiscal 2022, driven by a 4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency.
VF's e-commerce business declined 6% in Fiscal 2023, including a 5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. The decrease was primarily driven by declines in the Active segment e-commerce business, partially offset by growth in the Outdoor segment.

Revenues from VF-operated retail stores decreased 2% in Fiscal 2023, including a 3% unfavorable impact from foreign currency. VF opened 63 stores in Fiscal 2023, bringing the total number of VF-owned retail stores to 1,265 at March 2023, which also reflects 120 store closures during the period. There were 1,322 VF-owned retail stores at March 2022. Direct-to-consumer revenues were 45% of total VF revenues in Fiscal 2023 compared to 46% in Fiscal 2022.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

--------------
Balance Sheets

The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances for continuing operations at March 2023 compared to March 2022:
•Increase in accounts receivable — primarily due to the timing of collections.
•Increase in inventories — driven by increased in-transit inventory of $253.7 million resulting from the modification of terms with the majority of our suppliers to take ownership of inventory near point of shipment rather than destination, with the remaining increase resulting primarily from the impact of COVID-19 related challenges in the supply chain where prolonged manufacturing and logistics lead times forced earlier buy commitments, and softening consumer demand.
•Decrease in intangible assets — primarily due to $340.9 million of impairment charges related to the Supreme® indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset recorded in Fiscal 2023.
•Decrease in goodwill — primarily due to $394.1 million of impairment charges related to the Supreme reporting unit recorded in Fiscal 2023.
•Increase in other assets — primarily due to the $875.7 million payment related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed in The Timberland Company court case, which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case.

•Decrease in short-term borrowings — primarily due to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings.
•Increase in the current portion of long-term debt — due to the reclassification of €850.0 million ($923.4 million) of long-term notes due in September 2023, partially offset by the repayment of $500.0 million of long-term notes in April 2022.
•Increase in accounts payable — primarily due to the modification of terms with the majority of our suppliers to take ownership of inventory near point of shipment rather than destination and timing of payments.
•Decrease in accrued liabilities — primarily due to lower accrued income taxes, lower accrued compensation and the payout of the contingent consideration liability associated with the Supreme acquisition.
•Increase in long-term debt — due to the issuance of €500.0 million euro-denominated 4.125% fixed-rate notes maturing in March 2026 and €500.0 million euro-denominated 4.250% fixed-rate notes maturing in March 2029, and borrowings of $1.0 billion under the DDTL Agreement in Fiscal 2023, partially offset by the reclassification of €850.0 million ($923.4 million) of long-term notes due in September 2023.
•Decrease in other liabilities — primarily due to a $94.9 million favorable adjustment to VF's transition tax liability under the U.S. Tax Act pursuant to IRS examinations, lower pension liabilities and lower deferred compensation.

Liquidity and Cash Flows

We consider the following to be measures of our liquidity and capital resources:

------------------------- ---------- ----------
(Dollars in millions) March 2023 March 2022
Working capital $1,606.9 $1,272.7
Current ratio 1.5 to 1 1.4 to 1
Net debt to total capital 71.6% 61.0%

The increase in working capital and the current ratio at March 2023 compared to March 2022 was primarily due to a net increase in current assets driven by higher inventories. The overall increase was partially offset by a net increase in current liabilities driven by a higher current portion of long-term debt and higher accounts payable, which were partially offset by lower short-term borrowings and lower accrued liabilities for the periods compared as discussed in the "Balance Sheets" section above.
For the ratio of net debt to total capital, net debt is defined as short-term and long-term borrowings, in addition to operating lease liabilities, net of unrestricted cash. Total capital is defined as net debt plus stockholders’ equity. The increase in the net debt to total capital ratio at March 2023 compared to March 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in net debt at March 2023 and a decrease in stockholders' equity. The increase in net debt was primarily attributed to the issuance of €1.0 billion euro-denominated fixed rate notes and $1.0 billion of borrowings

under the DDTL Agreement in Fiscal 2023, as discussed in the "Balance Sheet" section above. The increase in net debt at March 2023 compared to March 2022 was partially offset by the repayment of $500.0 million of long-term notes in April 2022. The decrease in stockholders' equity at March 2023 compared to March 2022 was primarily driven by payments of dividends, partially offset by net income in the period.
VF’s primary source of liquidity is its expected annual cash flow from operating activities. Cash from operations is typically lower in the first half of the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak sales periods in the second half of the calendar year. Cash provided by operating activities in the second half of the calendar year is substantially higher as inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Additionally, direct-to-consumer sales are highest in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. VF's additional sources of liquidity include available borrowing capacity against its Global Credit Facility, available cash balances and international lines of credit.

Table of Contents
In summary, our cash flows from continuing operations were as follows:

-------------------------------------------- ---------------- ------- ---- --------- - -----
 Year Ended March

(In millions) 2023 2022
Cash provided (used) by operating activities $ (655.8) $ 858.2
Cash provided (used) by investing activities (188.1) 904.3
Cash provided (used) by financing activities 463.9 (1,268.8)

Cash Provided (Used) by Operating Activities

Cash flows related to operating activities are dependent on net income, adjustments to net income and changes in working capital. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022 was primarily due to an increase in net cash used by working capital and lower earnings for the periods compared. The increase in cash used by working capital was primarily driven by higher inventory balances and the $875.7 million payment related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed in The Timberland Company court case.
Cash Provided (Used) by Investing Activities
The decrease in cash provided by investing activities in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022 was primarily due to $616.9 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Occupational Workwear business and $598.8 million of proceeds from the sale of short-term investments in Fiscal 2022. Capital expenditures decreased $79.5 million and software purchases increased $12.5 million in Fiscal 2023 compared to the Fiscal 2022 period. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily driven by higher spending in the prior year related to a new distribution center in the Americas region. Fiscal 2023 also includes $99.5 million of proceeds from sale of assets, primarily related to certain office real estate and related assets.
Cash Provided (Used) by Financing Activities
The increase in cash provided by financing activities in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022 was primarily due to the issuance of €1.0 billion euro-denominated fixed rate notes and borrowings of $1.0 billion under the DDTL Agreement in Fiscal 2023. The increase was also due to a $350.0 million decrease in share repurchases and a $70.4 million decrease in dividends paid for the periods compared, partially offset by a net decrease in short-term borrowings of $648.4 million for the periods compared and the $57.0 million payment of Supreme contingent consideration in Fiscal 2023.
Share Repurchases
VF did not purchase shares of its Common Stock in the open market during Fiscal 2023. During Fiscal 2022, VF purchased 4.8 million shares of its Common Stock in open market transactions at a total cost of $350.0 million (average price per share of $72.84) under the share repurchase program authorized by VF's Board of Directors.
As of the end of Fiscal 2023, VF had $2.5 billion remaining for future repurchases under its share repurchase authorization. VF's capital deployment priorities in the near-to-medium term will be focused on optimizing and driving the performance of the current portfolio, reducing leverage and returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends.

Revolving Credit Facility and Short-term Borrowings
VF relies on its ability to generate cash flows to finance its ongoing operations. In addition, VF has significant liquidity from its available cash balances and credit facilities. VF maintains a $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the "Global Credit Facility") that expires in November 2026. VF may request an unlimited number of one year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the Global Credit Facility to exceed five years, subject to stated terms and conditions. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in U.S. dollars or any alternative currency (including euros and any other currency that is freely convertible into U.S. dollars, approved at the request of the Company by the lenders) and has a $75.0 million letter of credit sublimit. In addition, the Global Credit Facility supports VF’s U.S. commercial paper program for short-term, seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Outstanding short-term balances may vary from period to period depending on the level of corporate requirements.
VF has restrictive covenants on its Global Credit Facility, including a consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated net capitalization financial ratio covenant, as defined in the agreement as amended in February 2023, starting at 70% with future step downs. The calculation of consolidated net indebtedness is net of unrestricted cash and the calculation of consolidated net capitalization permits certain addbacks, including non-cash impairment charges, as defined in the amended agreement. The covenant calculation also excludes consolidated operating lease liabilities. As of March 2023, VF was in compliance with all covenants.
VF has a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to $2.25 billion to the extent that it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. As of March 2023, there were no commercial paper borrowings. Standby letters of credit issued as of March 2023 were $7.7 million, leaving approximately $2.2 billion available for borrowing against the Global Credit Facility at March 2023. Additionally, VF had approximately $814.9 million of cash and equivalents at March 2023.
VF has $84.6 million of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either VF or the banks. Total outstanding balances under these arrangements were $11.5 million at March 2023. Borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 39.1% at March 2023.
Senior Notes Issuance
In March 2023, VF issued €500.0 million of 4.125% euro-denominated fixed-rate notes maturing in March 2026 and €500.0 million of 4.250% euro-denominated fixed-rate notes maturing in March 2029. The 2029 notes were issued as a green bond, and thus an amount equal to the net proceeds has been

dedicated to projects that focus on VF's key environmental sustainability initiatives.
Maturity
On April 25, 2022, VF repaid the remaining $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2.050% Senior Notes due April 2022, in accordance with the terms of the notes.
Term Debt Facility
In August 2022, the Company entered into a DDTL Agreement. Under the DDTL Agreement, the lenders agreed to provide up to three separate delayed draw term loans (each, a “Delayed Draw”) to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.0 billion (which may be increased to $1.1 billion subject to the terms and conditions of the DDTL Agreement). The DDTL Agreement has a stated termination date of December 14, 2024. Subject to the terms and conditions of the DDTL Agreement, the Company may request extensions of the termination date.
During the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, VF completed two draws under the DDTL Agreement totaling $1.0 billion, all of which will mature on December 14, 2024. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings at March 2023 was 5.73%.
Supply Chain Financing Program
During the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, VF reinstated its voluntary supply chain finance ("SCF") program. The SCF program enables a significant portion of our suppliers of inventory to leverage VF's credit rating to receive payment from participating financial institutions prior to the payment date specified in the terms between VF and the supplier. The SCF program is administered through third-party platforms that allow participating suppliers to track payments from VF and elect which VF receivables, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. The transactions are at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and financial institutions, and VF is not a party to the agreements and has no economic interest in the supplier's decision to sell a receivable. The terms between VF and the supplier, including the amount due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by a supplier's participation in the SCF program. Amounts due to suppliers who voluntarily participate in the SCF program are included in the accounts payable line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheets and VF payments made under the SCF program are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in VF's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. VF has been informed by the participating financial institutions that amounts payable to them for suppliers who voluntarily participated in the SCF program and included in the accounts payable line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheet was $161.4 million at March 2023. The amounts settled through the SCF program were $989.8 million during the year ended March 2023.
In the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, VF extended its payment terms with eligible suppliers under the SCF program. The extended payment terms had a positive impact on Fiscal 2023 cash flows from operating activities of approximately $95.0 million and VF also expects a positive impact in Fiscal 2024; however, the change is not expected to have a material impact on VF's long-term overall liquidity or capital resources.

Rating Agencies
VF’s credit agency ratings allow for access to additional liquidity at competitive rates. At the end of March 2023, VF’s long-term debt ratings were ‘BBB+’ by Standard & Poor’s ("S&P") Global Ratings and ‘Baa2’ by Moody’s Investors Service ("Moody's"), and commercial paper ratings by those rating agencies were ‘A-2’ and ‘P-2’, respectively. VF's credit rating outlook at the end of March 2023 was 'negative' by S&P and 'stable' by Moody's.
None of VF’s long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control the notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase the notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if required by the respective holders of the notes. The change of control provision applies to all notes, except for the 2033 notes.
Dividends
Cash dividends totaled $1.81 per share in Fiscal 2023 compared to $1.98 in Fiscal 2022. The dividend payout ratio was 592.8% of diluted earnings per share in Fiscal 2023 compared to 56.0% in Fiscal 2022. The Company has declared a dividend of $0.30 per share that is payable in the first quarter of Fiscal 2024. Subject to approval by its Board of Directors, VF intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends.
Other Matters
As previously reported, VF petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (the “Court”) to resolve an IRS dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with VF’s acquisition of The Timberland Company in September 2011. While the IRS argues that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011, VF has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years. Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue. On January 31, 2022, the Court issued its opinion in favor of the IRS and on July 14, 2022 issued its final decision. VF believes the opinion of the Court was in error based on the technical merits and filed a notice of appeal on October 7, 2022. On October 19, 2022, VF paid $875.7 million related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed, which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case and will accrue interest income. VF continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and VF is vigorously defending its position. However, should the Court opinion ultimately be upheld on appeal, this income tax receivable will not be collected by VF. If the Court opinion is upheld, VF should be entitled to a refund of taxes paid on the periodic inclusions that VF has reported. However, any such refund could be substantially reduced by potential indirect tax effects resulting from application of the Court opinion. Deferred tax liabilities, representing VF’s future tax on annual inclusions, would also be released. The net impact to tax expense is estimated to be up to $730.0 million, plus the reversal of any interest income accrued on the payment, which was approximately $12.0 million at March 2023.

Contractual Obligations
Following is a summary of VF’s material contractual obligations and commercial commitments at the end of March 2023 that will require the use of funds:

-------------------------------- ----- ------ ---------------------------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ---- ----- ---- ---------- ----- --- - --- --- - ----- - -----
 Payment Due or Forecasted by Fiscal Year

 $ 11,661 $ 3,705 $ 1,551 $ 1,655 $ 295 $ 1,260 $ 3,195

Note: Amounts may not sum due to rounding.
(1)Long-term debt consists of required undiscounted principal payments on long-term debt and finance lease obligations.
(2)Operating leases represent required undiscounted lease payments during the noncancelable lease term. Variable payments for occupancy-related costs, real estate taxes, insurance and contingent rent are not included above. In addition, $73.7 million of leases (on an undiscounted basis) that have not yet commenced with terms of 2 to 12 years beginning in Fiscal 2024 are not included above.
(3)Interest payment obligations represent required interest payments on long-term debt. Amounts exclude amortization of debt issuance costs, debt discounts and acquisition costs that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements.
(4)Inventory obligations represent binding commitments to purchase finished goods and raw materials that are payable upon VF taking ownership of the inventory. This obligation excludes the amount included in accounts payable at March 2023 related to inventory purchases.

VF had other financial commitments at the end of Fiscal 2023 that are not included in the above table but may require the use of funds under certain circumstances:
•$110.9 million of surety bonds, custom bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees are not included in the table above because they represent contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other programs and would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its other obligations.
•Purchase orders for goods or services in the ordinary course of business are not included in the above table because they represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding commitments.
Management believes that VF’s cash and equivalents balances and expected funds to be provided by operating activities, as well as its Global Credit Facility, additional borrowing capacity and

access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of its current and long-term obligations when due, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures and pay quarterly dividends, and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. There continues to be uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the challenging macroeconomic environment and COVID-19 pandemic. However, management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity and flexibility to continue to operate during and after the disruptions caused by the challenging macroeconomic environment and COVID-19 pandemic, and meet its current and long-term obligations as they become due.
VF does not participate in transactions with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company.

---------------
Risk Management

VF is exposed to risks in the ordinary course of business. Management regularly assesses and manages exposures to these risks through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, by (i) taking advantage of natural hedges within VF, (ii) purchasing insurance from commercial carriers, or (iii) using derivative financial instruments. Some potential risks are discussed below:
Insured risks
VF is self-insured for a significant portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle and general liability exposures. VF purchases insurance from highly-rated commercial carriers to cover other risks, including directors and officers, cyber, property, stock throughput, employment practices, wage and hour and umbrella, and to establish stop-loss limits on self-insurance arrangements.

Cash and equivalents risks
VF had $814.9 million of cash and equivalents at the end of Fiscal 2023. Management continually monitors the credit ratings of the financial institutions with whom VF conducts business and geopolitical risks that may impact countries where VF has cash balances. Management also monitors the credit quality of cash equivalents.
Defined benefit pension plan risks
At the end of Fiscal 2023, VF’s defined benefit pension plans were overfunded by a net total of $90.4 million. The overfunded status includes a $71.8 million liability related to our U.S. unfunded supplemental defined benefit plan, $19.0 million of net liabilities related to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, and a $181.2 million net asset related to our U.S. qualified defined

VF Corporation Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K 35

Table of Contents

benefit plan. VF will continue to evaluate the funded status and future funding requirements of these plans, which depends in part on the future performance of the plans’ investment portfolios. Management believes that VF has sufficient liquidity to make any required contributions to the pension plans in future years.
VF’s reported earnings are subject to risks due to the volatility of its pension cost (income), which has ranged in recent years from cost of $101.9 million in the year ended March 2023 to income of $7.3 million in the year ended March 2022. These fluctuations are primarily due to differences in the amount of settlement charges recorded in the respective periods. The changes are also impacted by varying amounts of actuarial gains and losses that are deferred and amortized to future years’ pension cost (income). The assumptions that impact actuarial gains and losses include the rate of return on investments held by the pension plans, the discount rate used to value participant liabilities and demographic characteristics of the participants.
VF has taken a series of steps to manage the risk and volatility in the pension plans and their impact on the financial statements, including the following:
•The U.S. qualified and supplemental defined benefit plans were closed to new entrants at the end of 2004 and all future benefit accruals were frozen as of December 31, 2018.
•During the year ended March 2020, VF offered former employees in the U.S. qualified plan a lump-sum option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits. The U.S. qualified plan participants were reduced by 10% as a result of this offer. No additional funding of the pension plan was required as all distributions were paid out of existing plan assets, and the plan's funded status remained materially unchanged.
•During the year ended March 2023, VF entered into an agreement with The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential”) to purchase an irrevocable group annuity contract relating to approximately $330 million of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan obligations. The transaction closed on June 30, 2022 and was funded entirely by existing assets of the plan. Under the group annuity contract, Prudential assumed responsibility for benefit payments and annuity administration for approximately 17,700 retirees and beneficiaries.
The investment strategy of the U.S. qualified plan continues to define dynamic asset allocation targets that are dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded status, capital market expectations, and risk tolerance. Management will continue to evaluate actions that may help to reduce VF’s risks related to its defined benefit plans.
Interest rate risks
VF limits the risk of interest rate fluctuations by managing the mix of fixed and variable interest rate debt. In addition, VF may use derivative financial instruments to manage risk. Since most of VF’s long-term debt has fixed interest rates, the exposure primarily relates to changes in interest rates on variable rate short-term borrowings (which averaged approximately $1.0 billion at a 3.6% rate during Fiscal 2023). Additionally, VF entered into a DDTL Agreement during Fiscal 2023, which has a variable interest rate. VF entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of the cash flow risk

associated with the DDTL Agreement. Any change in interest rates would also affect interest income earned on VF’s cash equivalents. Based on the average amount of variable rate borrowings and cash equivalents during Fiscal 2023, the effect of a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would be a decrease in reported net income of approximately $8.9 million and a hypothetical 1% decrease in interest rates would be an increase in reported net income of approximately $8.9 million. The calculation does not take into account the impact of our interest rate swap.
Foreign currency exchange rate risks
VF is a global enterprise subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately 48% of VF’s revenues in the year ended March 2023 were generated in international markets. Most of VF’s foreign businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In periods where the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the euro or other foreign currencies where VF has operations, there is a negative impact on VF’s operating results upon translation of those foreign operating results into the U.S. dollar. As discussed later in this section, management hedges VF’s investments in certain foreign operations and foreign currency transactions.
The reported values of assets and liabilities in these foreign businesses are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For net advances to and investments in VF’s foreign businesses that are considered to be long-term, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on those long-term advances is deferred as a component of accumulated OCI in stockholders’ equity. The U.S. dollar value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with changes in the underlying functional currencies. In March 2023, VF issued €1.0 billion of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes, in February 2020, VF issued €1.0 billion of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes, and in September 2016, VF issued €850.0 million of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes. These notes have been designated as net investment hedges of VF’s investment in certain foreign operations. Because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument, foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated OCI as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments. Any amounts deferred in accumulated OCI will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.
VF monitors net foreign currency market exposures and enters into derivative foreign currency contracts to hedge the effects of exchange rate fluctuations for a significant portion of forecasted foreign currency cash flows or specific foreign currency transactions (relating to cross-currency inventory purchases, product sales, operating costs and intercompany royalty payments). VF’s practice is to buy or sell foreign currency exchange contracts that cover up to 80% of foreign currency exposures for periods of up to 24 months. Currently, VF uses only foreign exchange forward contracts but may use options or collars in the future. This use of financial instruments allows management to reduce the overall exposure to risks from exchange rate fluctuations on VF’s cash flows and earnings, since gains and losses on these contracts will offset a portion of losses and gains on the transactions being hedged.
For cash flow hedging contracts outstanding at the end of Fiscal 2023, a hypothetical 10% decrease and 10% increase in foreign

36 VF Corporation Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K

Table of Contents

currency exchange rates compared to rates at the end of Fiscal 2023, would result in an increase in the unrealized net gain of approximately $39.7 million and a decrease in the unrealized net gain of approximately $32.3 million, respectively. However, any change in the fair value of the hedging contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged exposure impacted by the currency rate changes.
Counterparty risks
VF is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative hedging instruments. To manage this risk, we have established counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative transactions with financial institutions that have ‘A minus/A3’ investment grade credit ratings or better. VF continually monitors the credit rating of, and limits the amount hedged with, each counterparty. Additionally, management utilizes a portfolio of financial institutions to minimize exposure to potential counterparty defaults and adjusts positions as necessary. VF also monitors counterparty risk for derivative contracts within the defined benefit pension plans.

Commodity price risks
VF is exposed to market risks for the pricing of cotton, leather, rubber, wool and other materials, primarily due to the impact on the cost of sourced finished goods from independent contractors. To manage risks of commodity price changes, management negotiates prices of finished goods in advance when possible. VF has not historically managed commodity price exposures by using derivative instruments.
Deferred compensation and related investment security risks
VF has nonqualified deferred compensation plans in which liabilities to the plans’ participants are based on the market values of the participants’ selection of a hypothetical portfolio of investment funds. VF invests in a portfolio of securities and variable life insurance contracts that substantially mirror the participants’ investment selections. The increases and decreases in deferred compensation liabilities are substantially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the market value of VF’s investments, resulting in an insignificant net exposure to operating results and financial position.

------------------------------------------
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

VF has chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report VF’s operating results and financial position in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. VF applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
The application of these accounting policies requires that VF make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Because VF’s business cycle

is relatively short (i.e., from the date inventory is purchased until that inventory is sold and payment is collected), actual results related to most estimates are known within a few months after any balance sheet date. In addition, VF may retain outside specialists to assist in valuations of business acquisitions and impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known.
VF believes the following accounting policies involve the most significant management estimates, assumptions and judgments used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements or are the most sensitive to change from outside factors. The application of these critical accounting policies and estimates is discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

---------------------
Business Combinations

VF accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, the consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition. All assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. VF allocates the purchase price of an acquired business to the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration, if any, is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date.
The application of the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and determination of fair value requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions related to estimated future revenues, growth rates, cash flows, discount rates and royalty rates, among other items. VF generally evaluates fair value at acquisition using three valuation techniques - the replacement cost, market and income methods

- and weights the valuation methods based on what is most appropriate in the circumstances. The process of assigning fair values, particularly to acquired intangible assets, is highly subjective. VF also utilizes third-party valuation specialists to assist management in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Management estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be exposed to potential impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, as discussed in the "Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill" section below.
During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.

During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, VF completed the acquisition of Supreme Holdings, Inc. ("Supreme") for $2.4 billion. Management allocated the purchase price of the acquired Supreme business to the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition, which resulted in excess purchase price of $1.25 billion that was recorded as goodwill. The acquired assets included the estimated fair value of $1.20 billion for the Supreme® trademark, which is an identifiable intangible asset management believes to have an indefinite life. The estimated fair value of the Supreme® trademark was determined using the relief-from-royalty method of the income valuation approach, which required the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including future revenues, growth rates, royalty rate, tax rates and discount rate associated with the acquired intangible asset.

Management's estimates and assumptions utilized internal forecasts of Supreme's future business performance and relevant market information. Management also utilized a third-party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Supreme® trademark.
Management believes the assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value of the Supreme® trademark were reasonable, but inherently uncertain and unpredictable. As a result, actual results have differed from estimates. Refer to the "Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill" section below for additional discussion regarding impairment considerations during Fiscal 2023 related to the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill

Definite-Lived Assets
VF’s depreciation policies for property, plant and equipment reflect judgments on the estimated economic lives and residual values, if any. VF’s amortization policies for definite-lived intangible assets reflect judgments on the estimated amounts and duration of future cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. In evaluating the amortizable life for customer relationship intangible assets, management considers historical attrition patterns for various groups of customers. In determining the lease term used to amortize operating lease right-of-use assets, VF considers initial terms and any renewal or termination options that may exist. When deemed reasonably certain, the renewal and termination options are included in the determination of lease term.
VF’s policy is to review property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. VF tests for potential impairment at the asset or asset group level, which is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. VF measures recoverability of the carrying value of an asset or asset group by comparison to the estimated pre-tax undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the forecasted pre-tax undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to be adequate to recover the asset’s carrying value, a fair value analysis is performed, and an impairment charge is recorded if there is an excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.
When testing property, plant and equipment for potential impairment, VF uses the income-based discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or asset group. The estimated pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group exceed its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value, the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated based on the after-tax discounted cash flows using an appropriate weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value.

When testing customer relationship intangible assets for potential impairment, management considers historical customer attrition rates and projected revenues and profitability related to customers that existed at acquisition. Management uses the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific application of the discounted cash flow method, to value customer relationship assets. The estimated pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset exceed its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value, the estimated fair value of the asset is calculated based on the present value of the after-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationship asset after deducting contributory asset charges, and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value.
When testing operating lease right-of-use assets for potential impairment, VF uses the income-based discounted cash flow method using the estimated cash flows of the respective asset or asset group. The estimated pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group through the end of its useful life are compared to its carrying value. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset exceed its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the pre-tax undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying value, the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group is calculated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use, and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and its carrying value. The impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro-rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Fair value for acquired intangible assets is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows. Indefinite-lived trademark or trade name intangible assets (collectively referred to herein as “trademarks”) represent individually acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in multiple countries. Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and is assigned at the reporting unit level.

Table of Contents

VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. As part of its annual impairment testing, VF may elect to assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If management’s assessment of these qualitative factors indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset or reporting unit is more than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the intangible asset or reporting unit is quantitatively tested for impairment.
An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively tested for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. Fair value of an indefinite-lived trademark is based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. Under this method, forecasted revenues for products sold with the trademark are assigned a royalty rate that would be charged to license the trademark (in lieu of ownership), and the estimated fair value is calculated as the present value of those forecasted royalties avoided by owning the trademark. The discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s WACC that considers market participant assumptions and is adjusted, as appropriate, to factor in the risk of the intangible asset. The royalty rate is selected based on consideration of (i) royalty rates included in active license agreements, if applicable, (ii) royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel and footwear industry, and (iii) the current performance of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment charge. If the estimated fair value of the trademark is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference.
Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. Reporting units are businesses with discrete financial information that is available and reviewed by management.
For goodwill impairment testing, VF estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. The income-based approach is based on the reporting unit’s forecasted future cash flows that are discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s WACC, as discussed above. For the market-based approach, management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods. The guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies. The market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies. Under the similar transactions method, valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenue/EBITDA data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit. Management typically assigns more weight to the income-based valuation method. Management also evaluates the fair value estimates of reporting units in the context of VF's total enterprise market value.
Based on the range of estimated fair values developed from the income and market-based methods, VF determines the estimated fair value for the reporting unit. If the estimated fair

value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not impaired and no further review is required. However, if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, VF calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and the estimated fair value.
The income-based fair value methodology requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding economic conditions in the markets in which VF operates and conditions in the capital markets, many of which are outside of management’s control. At the reporting unit level, fair value estimation requires management’s assumptions and judgments regarding the effects of overall economic conditions on the specific reporting unit, along with assessment of the reporting unit’s strategies and forecasts of future cash flows. Forecasts of individual reporting unit cash flows involve management’s estimates and assumptions regarding:
•Annual cash flows, on a debt-free basis, arising from future revenues and profitability, changes in working capital, capital spending and income taxes for a forecast period.
•A terminal growth rate for years beyond the forecast period. The terminal growth rate is selected based on consideration of growth rates used in the forecast period, historical performance of the reporting unit and economic conditions.
•A discount rate that reflects the risks inherent in realizing the forecasted cash flows. A discount rate considers the risk-free rate of return on long-term treasury securities, the risk premium associated with investing in equity securities of comparable companies, the beta obtained from comparable companies and the cost of debt for investment grade issuers. In addition, the discount rate may consider any company-specific risk (at the reporting unit level) in achieving the prospective financial information.
Under the market-based fair value methodology, judgment is required in evaluating market multiples and recent transactions. Management believes that the assumptions used for its impairment tests are representative of those that would be used by market participants performing similar valuations of VF’s reporting units.
Fiscal 2023 Impairment Testing
During the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, management determined that continued increases in the federal funds rate and strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, was a triggering event that required impairment testing of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. See additional discussion of the testing in the "Supreme Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis" section below.
Management performed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023. VF elected to bypass the qualitative analysis for the Supreme, Timberland and Icebreaker reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets. See additional discussion in the "Supreme Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis", "Timberland Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis" and "Icebreaker Reporting Unit and

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis" sections below. Management performed a qualitative analysis for all other reporting units and trademark intangible assets, as discussed below in the “Other Reporting Units - Qualitative Impairment Analysis” section. The carrying values of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets subject to qualitative assessment at the testing date of January 1, 2023, were $663.7 million and $638.6 million, respectively.
Supreme Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis
Supreme was acquired by VF in Fiscal 2021. Supreme is a global streetwear leader that sells apparel, accessories and footwear under its namesake brand, Supreme®. Products are sold globally through VF-operated stores and websites. The Supreme reporting unit is included in the Active reportable segment.
Interim Impairment Testing
During the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, due to continued increases in the federal funds rate and strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. The carrying values of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the October 1, 2022 testing date were $1.21 billion and $1.19 billion, respectively. As a result of the impairment testing performed, VF recorded impairment charges of $229.0 million and $192.9 million related to the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended March 2023.
The fair values of the Supreme reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were estimated using valuation techniques consistent with those discussed in the "Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill" section above, and utilized significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The impairment related to an increase in the market-based discount rates used in the valuations and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on financial projections.
Management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the Supreme reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset valuations considered recent and historical performance, strategic initiatives and industry trends. Assumptions used in the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business.
Key assumptions developed by management and used in the interim quantitative analysis of the Supreme reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset included:
•Financial projections and future cash flows reflecting results lower than prior forecasts primarily driven by the negative impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes. The projections assumed revenue growth and profitability improvement throughout the forecast period reflecting the long-term strategy for the business which was largely unchanged from the business combination valuation, and terminal growth rates based on the expected long-term growth rate of the business;
•Tax rates based on the statutory rates for the countries in which the brand operates and the related intellectual property is domiciled;

•Royalty rates based on market data as well as active license agreements with similar VF brands;
•Market-based discount rates reflecting increases in the federal funds rate; and,
•Market approach reflecting lower recent historical financial measures for Supreme and valuation multiples.
Annual Impairment Testing
In conjunction with VF's annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. The decision to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment analysis was based on the recent impairment results from the interim quantitative analysis, weakness in recent Supreme financial performance including the results from the latest season and the overall significance of the related assets.
As a result of the quantitative impairment analysis, VF recorded additional impairment charges of $165.1 million and $148.0 million to the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended March 2023. The remaining carrying values of the Supreme reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, after the impairment charges, were $825.9 million and $852.0 million, respectively.
The fair values of the Supreme reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were estimated using valuation techniques consistent with those discussed in the "Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill" section above, and utilized significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The impairment related to lower financial projections and increased risk of achieving management's forecasts.
Management's revenue and profitability forecasts used in the Supreme reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset valuations considered historical performance, strategic initiatives and industry trends. Assumptions used in the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business.
Key assumptions developed by management and used in the quantitative analysis of the Supreme reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset included:
•Financial projections and future cash flows, including a base year reflecting actual results lower than forecasts used in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, primarily driven by weakness in the North America region, and a longer recovery timeline, revenue growth and profitability improvement throughout the forecast period that reflects the long-term strategy for the business, including geographic expansion, and terminal growth rates based on the expected long-term growth rate of the business;
•Tax rates based on the statutory rates for the countries in which the brand operates and the related intellectual property is domiciled;
•Royalty rates based on market data as well as active license agreements with similar VF brands;

40 VF Corporation Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K

Table of Contents

•Market-based discount rates, including consideration of additional risk of achievement of the financial projections based on recent financial performance; and,
•Market approach reflecting lower recent historical financial measures for Supreme.
The annual and interim Supreme valuation models used by management assume revenue growth and profitability improvement, and execution of Supreme's long-term growth strategy, including expansion into new markets. If the brand is unable to achieve the financial projections, additional impairment of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset could occur in the future.
Timberland Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis
In conjunction with VF's annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of both the Timberland reporting unit goodwill, which includes the Timberland® brand, and the Timberland indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset, which includes both the Timberland® and Timberland PRO® brands. The decision to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment analysis was based on management's overall assessment of current events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, brand-specific performance and the overall significance of the related assets. Based on the analysis, management concluded the Timberland reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were not impaired. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 12%. The estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. The carrying values of the Timberland reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the January 1, 2023 testing date were $407.0 million and $999.5 million, respectively.
The Timberland® brand, acquired in 2011, offers outdoor, adventure-inspired lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories that combine performance benefits and versatile styling for men, women and children. Products are sold globally through chain, department and specialty stores, independent distributors and licensees, independently-operated partnership stores, concession retail stores, VF-operated stores and websites and on websites with strategic digital partners. The Timberland reporting unit is included in the Outdoor reportable segment.
The fair values of the Timberland reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were estimated using valuation techniques consistent with those discussed in the "Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill" section above, and utilized significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the Timberland reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset valuations considered recent and historical performance, strategic initiatives and industry trends. Assumptions used in the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business.

Key assumptions developed by management and used in the quantitative analysis of the Timberland reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset included:
•Financial projections and future cash flows, including a base year that considered recent actual results lower than previous internal forecasts, revenue growth and profitability improvement throughout the forecast period that reflects the long-term strategy for the business, and terminal growth rates based on the expected long-term growth rate of the business;
•Tax rates based on the statutory rates for the countries in which the brand operates and the related intellectual property is domiciled;
•Royalty rates based on market data as well as active license agreements for the brand and similar VF brands; and
•Market-based discount rates.
The Timberland valuation model used by management in the impairment testing assumes revenue growth and profitability improvement and execution of its long-term growth strategy. If the brand is unable to achieve the financial projections, including recovery from the current macroeconomic environment, an impairment of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset could occur in the future.
Management performed a sensitivity analysis on the impairment model used to test the Timberland reporting unit goodwill. In doing so, management determined that individual changes of a 200 basis point decrease in the compound annual growth rate for EBITDA, or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate, used in the discounted cash flow model did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value.
Icebreaker Reporting Unit and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Analysis
In conjunction with VF's annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the Icebreaker reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. The decision to bypass the optional qualitative impairment assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative impairment analysis was based on management's overall assessment of current events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations and brand-specific performance. Based on the analysis, management concluded the Icebreaker reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were not impaired. For goodwill, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 8%. The estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by a significant amount. The carrying values of the Icebreaker reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset at the January 1, 2023 testing date were $80.7 million and $60.5 million, respectively.
The Icebreaker® brand, acquired in Fiscal 2019, specializes in high-performance apparel based on natural fibers, including merino wool and plant-based fibers. The Icebreaker® brand is included in the Outdoor reportable segment.
The fair values of the Icebreaker reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were estimated using valuation

techniques consistent with those discussed in the "Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Goodwill" section above, and utilized significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).
Management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the Icebreaker reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset valuations considered recent and historical performance, strategic initiatives and industry trends. Assumptions used in the valuations were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of the business.
Key assumptions developed by management and used in the quantitative analysis of the Icebreaker reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset included:
•Financial projections and future cash flows, including a base year that considered recent actual results lower than previous internal forecasts, revenue growth and profitability improvement throughout the forecast period that reflects the long-term strategy for the business, and terminal growth rates based on the expected long-term growth rate of the business;
•Tax rates based on the statutory rates for the countries in which the brand operates and the related intellectual property is domiciled;
•Royalty rates based on market data as well as active license agreements for similar VF brands; and
•Market-based discount rates.
The Icebreaker valuation model used by management in the impairment testing assumes revenue growth and profitability improvement and execution of its long-term growth strategy. If the brand is unable to achieve the financial projections, including recovery from the current macroeconomic environment, an impairment of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset could occur in the future.
Management performed a sensitivity analysis on the impairment model used to test the Icebreaker reporting unit goodwill. In doing so, management determined that individual changes of a 100 basis point decrease in the compound annual growth rate for EBITDA, or a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate, used in the discounted cash flow model did not cause the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to decline below its carrying value.
Other Reporting Units - Qualitative Impairment Analysis
For all other reporting units, VF elected to perform a qualitative assessment during the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived

intangible asset impairment testing to determine whether it was more likely than not that the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets in those reporting units were impaired. In this qualitative assessment, VF considered relevant events and circumstances for each reporting unit, including (i) current year results and performance versus management's annual and strategic plans, (ii) financial outlook based on the latest strategic plan, (iii) changes in the reporting unit carrying value since prior year and the amounts relative to the size of the respective business, (iv) industry and market conditions in which the reporting unit operates, (v) macroeconomic conditions, including discount rate and foreign exchange rate changes, and (vi) changes in products or services offered by the reporting unit. If applicable, performance in recent years was compared to forecasts included in prior valuations. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, VF concluded it was more likely than not the carrying values of the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets were less than their fair values, and that further quantitative testing was not necessary.
Management’s Use of Estimates and Assumptions
Management made its estimates based on information available as of the date of our assessments, using assumptions we believe market participants would use in performing an independent valuation of the businesses. Although management believes the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment testing are reasonable and appropriate, it is possible that VF's assumptions and conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets in any reporting unit could change in future periods. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions, particularly our long-term financial projections, used in our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future, if, for example, (i) the businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in Fiscal 2024 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates and foreign currency exchange rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including loss of major customers or channels, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA.
A future impairment charge of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets could have a material effect on VF’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

------------
Income Taxes

As a global company, VF is subject to income taxes and files income tax returns in over 100 U.S. and foreign jurisdictions each year. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or changes in interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations or rulings by courts or government authorities leading to exposure to additional tax liabilities. In particular, tax authorities and the courts have increased their focus on income earned in no- or low-tax jurisdictions or income that is not taxed in any jurisdiction. Tax authorities have also become skeptical of

special tax rulings provided to companies offering lower taxes than may be applicable in other countries. VF makes an ongoing assessment to identify any significant exposure related to increases in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which VF operates.
Furthermore, VF was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under Belgium's excess profit tax regime. During 2015, the European Union Commission (“EU”) investigated and announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered the tax benefits to be collected from affected companies, including VF. Requests for annulment were filed by

42 VF Corporation Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K

Table of Contents

Belgium and VF Europe BVBA individually. During 2017 and 2018, VF Europe BVBA was assessed and paid €35.0 million tax and interest, which was recorded as an income tax receivable and is included in the other current assets line item in VF's Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on the expected success of the requests for annulment. During 2019, the General Court annulled the EU decision and the EU subsequently appealed the General Court’s annulment. In September 2021, the General Court's judgment was set aside by the Court of Justice of the EU and the case was sent back to the General Court to determine whether the excess profit tax regime amounted to illegal State aid. The case remains open and unresolved. If this matter is adversely resolved, these amounts will not be collected by VF.
The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and significant management judgment. VF’s income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. VF has reviewed all issues raised upon examination, as well as any exposure for issues that may be raised in future examinations. VF has evaluated these potential issues under the “more-likely-than-not” standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense could be materially affected to the extent VF prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances has been established, or to the extent VF is required to pay amounts greater than the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Under the more-likely-than-not standard, VF does not currently anticipate any material impact on earnings from the ultimate resolution of income tax uncertainties. There are no accruals for general or unknown tax expenses.
As previously reported, VF petitioned the U.S. Tax Court (the “Court”) to resolve an IRS dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with VF’s acquisition of The Timberland Company in September 2011. While the IRS argues

that all such income should have been immediately included in 2011, VF has reported periodic income inclusions in subsequent tax years. Both parties moved for summary judgment on the issue. On January 31, 2022, the Court issued its opinion in favor of the IRS and on July 14, 2022 issued its final decision. VF believes the opinion of the Court was in error based on the technical merits and filed a notice of appeal on October 7, 2022. On October 19, 2022, VF paid $875.7 million related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed, which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case and will accrue interest income. VF continues to believe its timing and treatment of the income inclusion is appropriate and VF is vigorously defending its position. However, should the Court opinion ultimately be upheld on appeal, this income tax receivable will not be collected by VF. If the Court opinion is upheld, VF should be entitled to a refund of taxes paid on the periodic inclusions that VF has reported. However, any such refund could be substantially reduced by potential indirect tax effects resulting from application of the Court opinion. Deferred tax liabilities, representing VF’s future tax on annual inclusions, would also be released. The net impact to tax expense is estimated to be up to $730.0 million, plus the reversal of any interest income accrued on the payment, which was approximately $12.0 million at March 2023.
As of March 2023, VF had $497.8 million of gross deferred income tax assets related to operating loss, credit and capital loss carryforwards, and $424.0 million of valuation allowances against those assets. Realization of deferred tax assets related to operating loss, credit and capital loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions, the amount and timing of which are uncertain, and on possible changes in tax laws. If management believes that VF will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income or capital gains to offset losses or credits during the carryforward periods, VF records valuation allowances to reduce those deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be ultimately realized. If in a future period management determines that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized differs from the net recorded amount, VF would record an adjustment to income tax expense in that future period.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

NOTE 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for Aldrich and Murray and environmental and product liability matters. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. Asbestos-Related Matters Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies of the Company have been named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims were filed against predecessors of Aldrich and Murray and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by predecessors of Aldrich or Murray, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of the Company's existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. On June 18, 2020, Aldrich and Murray filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants and to Aldrich and Murray. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to th...

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

--------------
Balance Sheets

The following discussion refers to significant changes in balances for continuing operations at March 2023 compared to March 2022:
•Increase in accounts receivable — primarily due to the timing of collections.
•Increase in inventories — driven by increased in-transit inventory of $253.7 million resulting from the modification of terms with the majority of our suppliers to take ownership of inventory near point of shipment rather than destination, with the remaining increase resulting primarily from the impact of COVID-19 related challenges in the supply chain where prolonged manufacturing and logistics lead times forced earlier buy commitments, and softening consumer demand.
•Decrease in intangible assets — primarily due to $340.9 million of impairment charges related to the Supreme® indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset recorded in Fiscal 2023.
•Decrease in goodwill — primarily due to $394.1 million of impairment charges related to the Supreme reporting unit recorded in Fiscal 2023.
•Increase in other assets — primarily due to the $875.7 million payment related to the 2011 taxes and interest being disputed in The Timberland Company court case, which was recorded as an income tax receivable based on the technical merits of our position with regards to the case.

•Decrease in short-term borrowings — primarily due to a decrease in commercial paper borrowings.
•Increase in the current portion of long-term debt — due to the reclassification of €850.0 million ($923.4 million) of long-term notes due in September 2023, partially offset by the repayment of $500.0 million of long-term notes in April 2022.
•Increase in accounts payable — primarily due to the modification of terms with the majority of our suppliers to take ownership of inventory near point of shipment rather than destination and timing of payments.
•Decrease in accrued liabilities — primarily due to lower accrued income taxes, lower accrued compensation and the payout of the contingent consideration liability associated with the Supreme acquisition.
•Increase in long-term debt — due to the issuance of €500.0 million euro-denominated 4.125% fixed-rate notes maturing in March 2026 and €500.0 million euro-denominated 4.250% fixed-rate notes maturing in March 2029, and borrowings of $1.0 billion under the DDTL Agreement in Fiscal 2023, partially offset by the reclassification of €850.0 million ($923.4 million) of long-term notes due in September 2023.
•Decrease in other liabilities — primarily due to a $94.9 million favorable adjustment to VF']:
