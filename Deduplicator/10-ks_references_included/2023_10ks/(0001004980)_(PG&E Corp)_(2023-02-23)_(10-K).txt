ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

This is a combined report of PG&E Corporation and the Utility and includes separate Consolidated Financial Statements for each of these two entities. This combined MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.

59

Key Factors Affecting Financial Results

PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that their financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the following factors:

•The Uncertainties in Connection with Wildfires, Wildfire Mitigation, and Associated Cost Recovery. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows may be materially affected by the costs and effectiveness of the Utility’s wildfire mitigation initiatives; the extent of damages from wildfires that do occur; the financial impacts of wildfires; and PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s ability to mitigate those financial impacts with insurance, the Wildfire Fund, and regulatory recovery.

In response to the wildfire threat facing California, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have taken aggressive steps to mitigate the threat of catastrophic wildfires. The Utility’s wildfire mitigation initiatives include EPSS, PSPS, vegetation management, asset inspections, and system hardening. In particular, in 2022 the Utility expanded the EPSS program to all high fire risk areas. The Utility is also focused on undergrounding more lines each year while using economies of scale to make undergrounding more cost efficient. These initiatives significantly reduced the number of CPUC-reportable ignitions and the number of acres burned. The success of the Utility’s wildfire mitigation efforts depends on many factors, including whether the Utility is able to retain or contract for the workforce necessary to execute its wildfire mitigation actions.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenditures in connection with these initiatives. For more information on incurred expenditures, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The extent to which the Utility will be able to recover these expenditures and other potential costs through rates is uncertain. If additional requirements are imposed that go beyond current expectations, such requirements could have a substantial impact on the costs of the Utility’s wildfire mitigation initiatives.

The Utility is subject to a number of legal and regulatory requirements related to its wildfire mitigation efforts, which require periodic inspections of electric assets and ongoing reporting related to this work. Although the Utility believes that it has complied substantially with these requirements, it is undertaking a review and has identified instances of noncompliance. The Utility intends to update the CPUC and OEIS as its review progresses. The Utility could face fines, penalties, enforcement action, or other adverse legal or regulatory consequences for the late inspections or other noncompliance related to wildfire mitigation efforts. See “Self-Reports to the CPUC” in “Regulatory Matters” below.

Despite these extensive measures, the potential that the Utility’s equipment will be involved in the ignition of future wildfires, including catastrophic wildfires, is significant. This risk may be attributable to, and exacerbated by, a variety of factors, including climate (in particular extended periods of seasonal dryness coupled with periods of high wind velocities and other storms), infrastructure, and vegetation conditions. Once an ignition has occurred, the Utility is unable to control the extent of damages, which is primarily determined by environmental conditions (including weather and vegetation conditions), third-party suppression efforts, and the location of the wildfire.

The financial impact of past wildfires is significant. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had recorded aggregate liabilities of $1.025 billion, $400 million, $1.175 billion, and $100 million for claims in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire, respectively, and in each case before available insurance, and, in the case of the 2021 Dixie fire and the 2022 Mosquito fire, other probable cost recoveries. These liability amounts correspond to the lower end of the range of reasonably estimable probable losses but do not include all categories of potential damages and losses.

On September 24, 2021, the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office charged the Utility with 31 counts in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire, of which the court has dismissed 20 counts. If the Utility were to be convicted of any of the remaining charges, the Utility could be subject to material fines, penalties, and restitution, as well as non-monetary remedies such as oversight requirements. Accordingly, depending on which charges the Utility were to be convicted of, its total losses associated with the 2020 Zogg fire could materially exceed the $400 million of aggregate liability that PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility may be able to mitigate the financial impact of future wildfires in excess of insurance coverage through the Wildfire Fund, or cost recovery through rates. Each of these mitigations involves uncertainties, and liabilities could exceed available recoveries. See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

60

Recorded liabilities in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire and the 2021 Dixie fire have already exceeded potential amounts recoverable under applicable insurance policies. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility has recorded insurance receivables of $430 million for the 2019 Kincade fire, $370 million for the 2020 Zogg fire, $530 million for the 2021 Dixie fire, and $45 million for the 2022 Mosquito fire. Additionally, the Utility does not expect that any of its liability insurance would cover restitution payments, if such payments were ordered by the court presiding over the criminal proceeding in connection with the 2020 Zogg fire.

If the eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires were to exceed $1.0 billion in any Wildfire Fund coverage year (“Coverage Year”), the Utility may be eligible to make a claim against the Wildfire Fund under AB 1054 for such excess amount. The Wildfire Fund is available to the Utility to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from wildfires, provided that the Utility satisfies the conditions to the Utility’s ongoing participation in the Wildfire Fund set forth in AB 1054 and that the Wildfire Fund has sufficient remaining funds. However, the impact of AB 1054 on PG&E Corporation and the Utility is subject to numerous uncertainties, including the Utility’s ability to demonstrate to the CPUC that wildfire-related costs paid from the Wildfire Fund were just and reasonable and therefore not subject to reimbursement, and whether the benefits of participating in the Wildfire Fund ultimately outweigh its substantial costs. Finally, recoveries for the 2019 Kincade fire would be subject to a 40% limitation on the allowed amount of claims arising before emergence from bankruptcy. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility has recorded a Wildfire Fund receivable of $175 million for the 2021 Dixie fire. See “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

The Utility will be permitted to recover its wildfire-related claims and legal fees through rates only if the CPUC or the FERC, as applicable, determines that the Utility has met the prudency standard. The revised prudency standard under AB 1054 has not been interpreted or applied by the CPUC, and it is possible that the CPUC could interpret the standard or apply it to the relevant facts differently from how the Utility has interpreted and applied the standard, in which case the Utility may not be able to recover all or a portion of expenses that it has recorded as receivables. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility has recorded receivables for regulatory recovery of $503 million for the 2021 Dixie fire and $60 million for the 2022 Mosquito fire. See “2021 Dixie Fire,” and “2022 Mosquito Fire” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for more information.

•The Timing and Outcome of Ratemaking and Other Proceedings. Regulatory ratemaking proceedings are a key aspect of the Utility’s business. The Utility’s revenue requirements consist primarily of a base amount set to enable the Utility to recover its reasonable operating expenses (e.g., maintenance, administrative and general expenses) and capital costs (e.g., depreciation and financing expenses). In addition, the CPUC authorizes the Utility to collect revenues to recover costs that the Utility is allowed to pass through to customers (referred to as “Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings” below), including its costs to procure electricity and natural gas for customers and to administer public purpose and customer programs. Although the Utility generally seeks to recover its recorded costs on a timely basis, in recent years, the amount of the costs recorded in memorandum and balancing accounts has increased. The Utility has also applied to transfer its non-nuclear generation assets to Pacific Generation and potentially sell a minority interest in Pacific Generation. The outcome of regulatory proceedings can be affected by many factors, including intervening parties’ testimonies, potential rate impacts, the regulatory and political environments, and other factors. See Notes 4 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters” below.

•The Outcome of Other Enforcement, Litigation, and Regulatory Matters, and Other Government Proposals. The Utility is subject to enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters, including those described above, the Safety Culture OII, EOEP proceedings, and actions in connection with the Utility’s WMP, and safety and other self-reports. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. In addition, the Utility’s business profile and financial results could be impacted by the outcome of recent calls for municipalization of part or all of the Utility’s businesses, actions by municipalities and other public entities to acquire the electric assets of the Utility within their respective jurisdictions and calls for state intervention, including the possibility of a state takeover of the Utility. See “Jurisdictions may attempt to acquire the Utility’s assets through eminent domain” in Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information. These matters could result in penalties, additional regulatory requirements, or changes to the Utility’s operations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility seek to limit these matters by implementing a robust compliance program and by delivering excellent customer experiences.

61

•PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Ability to Control Operating Costs. Under cost-of-service ratemaking, a utility’s earnings depend on its ability to manage costs within the amounts authorized for recovery in its ratemaking proceedings. The Utility has set a goal to increase its capital investments to meet safety and climate goals, while also reducing non-fuel Operating and maintenance costs by two percent per year. The Utility’s ability to meet this goal depends on whether the Utility can improve the planning and execution of its work by continuing to implement the Lean operating system.

For more information about the risks that could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, or that could cause future results to differ from historical results, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.  In addition, this annual report contains forward-looking statements that are necessarily subject to various risks and uncertainties.  These statements reflect management’s judgment and opinions that are based on current estimates, expectations, and projections about future events and assumptions regarding these events and management’s knowledge of facts as of the date of this report.  See “Forward-Looking Statements” above for a list of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility are unable to predict all the factors that may affect future results and do not undertake an obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise.

Tax Matters

PG&E Corporation had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $26.6 billion and California net operating loss carryforward of approximately $25.2 billion as of December 31, 2022.

Under Section 382 of the IRC, if a corporation (or a consolidated group) undergoes an “ownership change,” net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain shareholders (generally five percent shareholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such shareholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Amended Articles limit Transfers (as defined in the Amended Articles) that increase a person’s or entity’s (including certain groups of persons) ownership of PG&E Corporation’s equity securities to 4.75% or more prior to the Restriction Release Date (as defined in the Amended Articles) without approval by the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation (the “Ownership Restrictions”). As discussed below under “Update on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles,” due to the election to treat the Fire Victim Trust as a grantor trust for income tax purposes, the calculation of Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) will effectively be based on a reduced number of shares outstanding, namely the total number of outstanding equity securities less the number of equity securities held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo. As of the date of this report, it is more likely than not that PG&E Corporation has not undergone an ownership change, and consequently, its net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes are not limited by Section 382 of the IRC.

Furthermore, the activities of the Fire Victim Trust are treated as activities of the Utility for tax purposes. Accordingly, PG&E Corporation will recognize income tax benefits and the corresponding DTA as the Fire Victim Trust sells shares of PG&E Corporation common stock, and the amounts of such benefits and assets will be impacted by the price at which the Fire Victim Trust sells the shares, rather than the price at the time such shares were transferred to the Fire Victim Trust. At various dates throughout 2022, the Fire Victim Trust exchanged Plan Shares for an equal number of New Shares in the manner contemplated by the Share Exchange and Tax Matters Agreement; in each case, the Fire Victim Trust thereafter reported that it sold the applicable New Shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation common stock in the aggregate amount of 230,000,000 shares resulted in an aggregate tax benefit of $870 million recorded in PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

62

Update on Ownership Restrictions in PG&E Corporation’s Amended Articles

As a result of the grantor trust election, shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust are treated as held by the Utility and, in turn, attributed to PG&E Corporation for income tax purposes. Consequently, any shares of PG&E Corporation common stock owned by the Fire Victim Trust, along with any shares owned by the Utility directly, are effectively excluded from the total number of outstanding equity securities when calculating a person’s Percentage Stock Ownership (as defined in the Amended Articles) for purposes of the 4.75% ownership limitation in the Amended Articles. Shares owned by ShareCo are also effectively excluded because ShareCo is a disregarded entity for income tax purposes. For example, although PG&E Corporation had 2,466,208,388 shares outstanding as of February 16, 2023, only 1,800,721,208 shares (the number of outstanding shares of common stock less the number of shares held by the Fire Victim Trust, the Utility, and ShareCo) count as outstanding for purposes of the ownership restrictions in the Amended Articles. As such, based on the total number of outstanding equity securities and taking into account the shares of PG&E Corporation common stock known to have been sold by the Fire Victim Trust as of February 16, 2023, a person’s effective Percentage Stock Ownership limitation for purposes of the Amended Articles as of February 16, 2023 was 3.46% of outstanding shares. As of February 16, 2023, to the knowledge of PG&E Corporation, the Fire Victim Trust had sold 290,000,000 shares of PG&E Corporation common stock in the aggregate.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion presents PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s operating results for 2022 and 2021.  See “Key Factors Affecting Financial Results” above for further discussion about factors that could affect future results of operations.

See “Results of Operations” in Item 7 of the 2021 Form 10-K for discussion of results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020.

PG&E Corporation

The consolidated results of operations consist primarily of results related to the Utility, which are discussed in the “Utility” section below.  The following table provides a summary of net income (loss) available for common shareholders:

------------------ ----- ----- ---- ----- - -----
(in millions) 2022 2021
Consolidated Total $ 1,800 $ (102)
PG&E Corporation (412) (226)
Utility 2,212 124

PG&E Corporation’s net loss primarily consists of income taxes and interest expense on long-term debt. The increase in PG&E Corporation’s net loss for 2022, as compared to 2021, is primarily due to increased interest rates on long-term debt.

Utility

The table below shows certain items from the Utility’s Consolidated Statements of Income for 2022 and 2021.  The table separately identifies the revenues and costs that impacted earnings from those that did not impact earnings.  In general, expenses the Utility is authorized to pass through directly to customers (such as costs to purchase electricity and natural gas, as well as costs to fund public purpose programs) and the corresponding amount of revenues collected to recover those pass-through costs do not impact earnings.

63

Revenues that impact earnings are primarily those that have been authorized by the CPUC and the FERC to recover the Utility’s costs to own and operate its assets and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return on rate base.  Expenses that impact earnings are primarily those that the Utility incurs to own and operate its assets.

Utility Revenues and Costs that Impacted Earnings

The following discussion presents the Utility’s operating results for 2022 and 2021, focusing on revenues and expenses that impacted earnings for these periods.

Operating Revenues

The Utility’s electric and natural gas operating revenues that impacted earnings increased by $1.0 billion, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the recognition of approximately $310 million in revenues related to the settlement agreement for the 2018 CEMA application (see “2018 CEMA Application” below), the recognition of approximately $180 million in revenues related to the final decision approving $356.3 million in revenue requirements for capital expenditures incurred in the period from 2011 through 2014 for its GT&S system (see “2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case” below), increased base revenues authorized in the 2020 GRC, and additional revenues as authorized through the FERC formula rate. In addition, the Utility recognized approximately $113 million in nuclear decommissioning revenues in 2022 with no comparable revenues in 2021. This is consistent with the 2018 NDCTP final decision that authorized no decommissioning revenues for 2021 and $113 million in revenues in 2022. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $180 million of previously deferred revenues recognized in conjunction with interim rate relief collected in 2021 associated with the 2020 WMCE application (see “2020 WMCE Application” below).

64

Operating and Maintenance

The Utility’s operating and maintenance expenses that impacted earnings decreased by $83 million, or 1%, in 2022 compared to 2021, as a result of operating cost efficiencies and decreases in the recognition of previously deferred costs including $90 million related to residential uncollectibles and approximately $180 million recognized in conjunction with interim rate relief associated with the 2020 WMCE application (see “2020 WMCE Application” below). In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Utility recorded a $124 million charge related to the September 21, 2021 joint motion for approval of settlement agreement associated with the 2020 WMCE filing, with no comparable charge in the same period in 2022. These decreases were partially offset by the recognition of approximately $310 million of previously deferred expenses, which were authorized by the settlement agreement for the 2018 CEMA application (see “2018 CEMA Application” below) in the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.

SB 901 Securitization Charges, Net

SB 901 securitization charges, net, that impacted earnings increased by $608 million, or 100%, in 2022 compared to 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Utility recorded $608 million in net SB 901 securitization charges, for inception of the regulatory asset and liability pursuant to the CHT decision, as well as tax benefits realized within income tax expense in the current year related to the Fire Victim Trust’s sale of PG&E Corporation common stock, with no comparable charges in 2021. For more information, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.

Wildfire-Related Claims, Net of Recoveries

Costs related to wildfires that impacted earnings decreased by $21 million, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of $225 million related to the 2019 Kincade fire, $100 million related to the 2022 Mosquito fire, $25 million related to the 2021 Dixie fire, and $25 million related to the 2020 Zogg fire in the year ended December 31, 2022. These charges were partially offset by $95 million of probable recoveries through insurance and the WEMA related to the 2022 Mosquito fire and $25 million in probable recoveries through the Wildfire Fund related to the 2021 Dixie fire. The Utility recognized pre-tax charges of $1.15 billion related to the 2021 Dixie fire, $175 million related to the 2019 Kincade fire, and $100 million related to the 2020 Zogg fire in the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by $1.06 billion of probable recoveries through insurance, the WEMA, and the Wildfire Fund related to the 2021 Dixie fire and $100 million of probable insurance recoveries related to the 2020 Zogg fire in the year ended December 31, 2021. See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below.

In addition to the probable wildfire-related recoveries noted above, the Utility has recorded $125 million of probable recoveries through FERC TO formula rates, which are recorded as a reduction to regulatory liabilities and are not captured in wildfire-related claims.

See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Wildfire Fund Expense

Wildfire Fund expense that impacted earnings decreased by $40 million, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to accelerated amortization of the Wildfire Fund asset recorded in 2021 as a result of the Wildfire Fund receivable accrued in relation to the 2021 Dixie fire, with no material amounts recorded in 2022.

See Notes 3 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Depreciation, Amortization, and Decommissioning

The Utility’s depreciation, amortization, and decommissioning expenses increased by $453 million, or 13%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to an increase in net capital additions and an increase in decommissioning expense beginning in January 2022 primarily as a result of the final 2018 NDCTP decision.

Interest Income

The Utility’s interest income that impacted earnings increased by $140 million, or 636%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher interest rates earned on regulatory balancing accounts.

65

Interest Expense

Interest expense that impacted earnings increased by $285 million, or 21%, in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the issuance of additional long-term debt and an increase in interest rates on variable-rate debt.

Other Income, Net

Changes to Other income, net that impact earnings are primarily driven by fluctuations in the balance of construction work in progress that impact the equity component of AFUDC, and gains and losses on equity securities held by the customer credit trust.

Income Tax Provision (Benefit)

Income tax benefit increased by $2.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a write-off of a DTA associated with the grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust in the year ended December 31, 2021 and a benefit recognized related to the sale of shares in the Fire Victim Trust in the year ended December 31, 2022.

The following table reconciles the income tax expense at the federal statutory rate to the income tax provision:

------------------------------------------------------------- ------- - ---- ------ -
 2022 2021
Federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %
Increase (decrease) in income tax rate resulting from:
State income tax (net of federal benefit) (1) (26.9) % 24.1 %
Effect of regulatory treatment of fixed asset differences (2) (49.2) % (51.6) %
Tax credits (1.3) % (1.2) %
Fire Victim Trust (3) (64.0) % 91.9 %
Other, net 2.2 % 2.6 %
Effective tax rate (118.2) % 86.8 %

(1) Includes the effect of state flow-through ratemaking treatment and the effect of the grantor trust election.
(2) Includes the effect of federal flow-through ratemaking treatment for certain property-related costs. For these temporary tax differences, the Utility recognizes the deferred tax impact in the current period and record offsetting regulatory assets and liabilities. Therefore, the Utility’s effective tax rate is impacted as these differences arise and reverse. The Utility recognizes such differences as regulatory assets or liabilities as it is probable that these amounts will be recovered from or returned to customers in future rates. The amounts also reflect the impact of the amortization of excess deferred tax benefits to be refunded to customers as a result of the Tax Act.
(3) Includes the tax benefit of the sale of shares by the Fire Victim Trust in 2022 and the tax effect of the grantor trust election for the Fire Victim Trust in 2021. See “Tax Matters” above and Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Utility Revenues and Costs that did not Impact Earnings

Fluctuations in revenues that did not impact earnings are primarily driven by procurement costs. See below for more information.

66

Cost of Electricity

The Utility’s cost of electricity includes the cost of power purchased from third parties (including renewable energy resources), fuel and associated transmission costs used in its own generation facilities, fuel and associated transmission costs supplied to other facilities under power purchase agreements, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities. Cost of electricity also includes net sales (Utility owned generation and third parties) in the CAISO electricity markets. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Utility’s total purchased power is driven by customer demand, net CAISO electricity market activities (purchases or sales), the availability of the Utility’s own generation facilities (including Diablo Canyon and its hydroelectric plants), and the cost-effectiveness of each source of electricity. The cost of electricity decreased in 2022 as compared to 2021. This was primarily due to decreased customer demand and higher energy sales to the CAISO, partially offset by higher fuel prices.

-------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- --- - -----
(in millions) 2022 2021
Cost of purchased power, net $ 2,283 $ 2,883
Fuel used in own generation facilities 473 349
Total cost of electricity $ 2,756 $ 3,232

Cost of Natural Gas

The Utility’s cost of natural gas includes the costs of procurement, storage and transportation of natural gas, costs to comply with California’s cap-and-trade program, and realized gains and losses on price risk management activities. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The cost of natural gas increased in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to increased customer demand and higher market prices. This was driven primarily by below-normal winter temperatures and prolonged drought conditions, resulting in lower California and Pacific Northwest hydro-electric generation output and higher demand from natural-gas fired generation. Lower natural gas storage levels and regional pipeline constraints also contributed to higher natural gas prices.

--------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- --- - -----
(in millions) 2022 2021
Cost of natural gas sold $ 1,957 $ 1,010
Transportation cost of natural gas sold 143 139
Total cost of natural gas $ 2,100 $ 1,149

Operating and Maintenance Expenses

The Utility’s operating expenses that did not impact earnings include certain costs that the Utility is authorized to recover as incurred.  If the Utility were to spend more than authorized amounts, these expenses could have an impact on earnings.

Other Income, Net

The Utility’s other income, net that did not impact earnings includes pension and other post-retirement benefit costs that fluctuate primarily from market and interest rate changes.

Nuclear Operations

Capacity factors, which are significantly affected by the number and duration of refueling and non-refueling outages, reflect the availability of Diablo Canyon’s generation to the California electricity market. Management analyzes capacity factors by comparing Diablo Canyon’s actual generation to forecasted annual capacity factors, which reflect planned refueling outages, curtailments for condenser cleaning, allowances for minor curtailments resulting from equipment issues, and curtailments for major ocean storms.

Apart from cost-of-service ratemaking and beginning on September 2, 2022, the Utility is entitled to receive a monthly performance-based disbursement. For more information, see “Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations” below.

67

The Utility manages its scheduled refueling outages with the objective of minimizing their duration and maintaining high nuclear generating capacity factors, resulting in a stable generation base for the Utility’s wholesale and retail power marketing activities. During scheduled refueling outages, the Utility performs maintenance and equipment upgrades to minimize the occurrence of unplanned outages and to maintain safe, reliable operations. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Diablo Canyon achieved an average capacity factor of 90% and 84%, respectively. As previously disclosed, Diablo Canyon Unit 2 experienced five outages between July 2020 and April 2021, each due or related to excessive vibrations within the main generator.

In addition to the maintenance and equipment upgrades performed by the Utility during scheduled refueling outages, the Utility has extensive operating and security procedures in place to assure the safe operation of Diablo Canyon. The Utility also has extensive safety systems in place designed to protect the plant, personnel, and surrounding area in the unlikely event of an accident or other incident.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

Overview

PG&E Corporation and the Utility expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund their present and future commitments.

The Utility’s ability to fund operations, finance capital expenditures, make scheduled principal and interest payments, and make distributions to PG&E Corporation depends on the levels of its operating cash flows and access to the capital and credit markets. The CPUC authorizes the Utility’s capital structure, the aggregate amount of long-term and short-term debt that the Utility may issue, and the revenue requirements the Utility is able to collect to recover its cost of capital. The Utility generally utilizes retained earnings, equity contributions from PG&E Corporation and long-term debt issuances to maintain its CPUC-authorized long-term capital structure consisting of 52% equity and 48% debt and preferred stock and relies on short-term debt, including its revolving credit facilities, to fund temporary financing needs. On May 28, 2020, the CPUC approved a final decision in the Chapter 11 Proceedings OII, which, among other things, grants the Utility a temporary, five-year waiver from compliance with its authorized capital structure for the financing in place upon the Utility’s emergence from Chapter 11.

PG&E Corporation’s ability to fund operations, make scheduled principal and interest payments, and fund equity contributions to the Utility depends on the level of cash on hand, cash received from the Utility, and PG&E Corporation’s access to the capital and credit markets.

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s credit ratings may be affected by the ultimate outcome of pending enforcement and litigation matters. Credit rating downgrades may impact the cost and availability of short-term borrowings, including credit facilities, and long-term debt costs. In addition, some of the Utility’s commodity contracts contain collateral posting provisions tied to the Utility’s credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies. The collateral posting provisions for some of the Utility’s power and natural gas commodity, and transportation and service agreements state that if the Utility’s credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, the Utility would be required to post additional cash immediately to fully collateralize some or all of its net liability positions.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have various contractual commitments which impact cash requirements. These commitments are discussed in “Purchase Commitments” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Arrearages Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic

PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows have been and could continue to be significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of variant strains of the virus (including Delta and Omicron), and the resulting economic conditions and government orders have had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Utility’s customers and, as a result, these circumstances have impacted and will continue to impact the Utility for an indeterminate period of time. In particular, the Utility continues to experience increased arrearages. The principal areas of near-term impact include liquidity, financial results and business operations, stemming primarily from the ongoing economic hardship of the Utility’s customers, an annual cap set by the CPUC on the number of service disconnections for residential customers, and the CPUC’s “Emergency Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer COVID-19 Protections.” The Utility resumed non-residential and residential service disconnections as of October 13, 2022. The Utility’s accounts receivable balances over 30 days outstanding as of December 31, 2022, were approximately $1.1 billion, or $890 million higher as compared to the balance as of December 31, 2019. The Utility is unable to estimate the portion of the increase directly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had access to approximately $2.9 billion of total liquidity comprised of approximately $609 million of Utility cash, $125 million of PG&E Corporation cash and $2.2 billion of availability under PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s revolving credit facilities. The 2022 cost of capital application was filed off-cycle based on the extraordinary event of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government response. See “Cost of Capital Proceedings” below for more information.

The Utility established the CPPMA for tracking costs related to the CPUC’s emergency authorization and order for the period the CPPMA was in effect. As of December 31, 2022, the CPPMA totaled $26 million and is reflected in Long-term regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition to the $26 million recorded to the CPPMA, the Utility recorded approximately $126 million of under-collections from residential customers from March 4, 2020 to December 31, 2022 to the RUBA, which has been approved by the CPUC and is reflected in Regulatory balancing accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 205, which included authorization for additional incremental CAPP funding of $958 million for California IOUs. The Utility received approximately $200 million in November 2022 to reduce the amounts owed by customer accounts in arrears. The amount of funding was determined by the California Department of Community Services and Development, which is the agency responsible for administering the CAPP.

Because electric rates have been set using a sales forecast that has been adjusted for impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not expect significant variances between the forecast of electric usage and actual electric usage due to COVID-19 in 2023. Consequently, PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to result in undercollections.

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact PG&E Corporation and the Utility financially, and PG&E Corporation and the Utility will continue to monitor the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility maintain separate bank accounts and primarily invest their cash in money market funds. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Utility holds restricted cash that primarily consists of AB 1054 and SB 901 fixed recovery charge collections that are to be used to service the associated bonds.

Financial Resources

Equity Financings

On April 30, 2021, PG&E Corporation entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with the Agents, the Forward Sellers and the Forward Purchasers (each as defined in “At the Market Equity Distribution Program” in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), establishing an at the market equity distribution program, pursuant to which PG&E Corporation, through the Agents, may offer and sell from time to time shares of PG&E Corporation’s common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $400 million. The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that, in addition to the issuance and sale of shares of common stock by PG&E Corporation to or through the Agents, PG&E Corporation may enter into Forward Sale Agreements (as defined in “At the Market Equity Distribution Program” in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8) with the Forward Purchasers. On October 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation suspended the At the Market Equity Distribution Program until further notice. As of the suspension date for this program, PG&E Corporation had not sold any shares pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility plan to meet their capital requirements for 2023 through internally generated funds and the issuance of long-term debt, short-term debt, and the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation. (See “Application with Pacific Generation LLC for Approval to Transfer Non-Nuclear Generation Assets” below.) PG&E Corporation does not plan to issue any equity securities in 2023 or 2024. Factors that could affect PG&E Corporation’s planned equity issuances include liquidity and cash flow needs, capital expenditures, interest rates, the timing and outcome of ratemaking proceedings, and the timing and terms of other financings, including the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation.

For more information, see “AB 1054” in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility had $500 million and $1.5 billion available under their respective $500 million and $4.4 billion revolving credit facilities. The Utility also has access to the Receivables Securitization Program, under which the Utility may borrow the lesser of the facility limit and the facility availability. The facility limit fluctuates between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion depending on the periods set forth in the amendment. Further, the facility availability may vary based on the amount of accounts receivable that the Utility owns that are eligible for sale to the SPV and the portion of those accounts receivable that are sold to the SPV that are eligible for advances by the lenders under the Receivables Securitization Program from time to time.

Utility

On March 31, 2022, the Utility prepaid in full the remaining portion of the 18-month tranche loans pursuant to the 2020 Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement, in a principal amount equal to $298 million. As a result of such prepayment, the 2020 Utility Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated and is no longer outstanding.

For more information, see “Credit Facilities” in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Intercompany Note Payable

On August 11, 2021, PG&E Corporation borrowed $145 million from the Utility under an interest bearing 364-day intercompany note due August 10, 2022. On June 17, 2022, this loan was repaid in full.

Dividends

On December 20, 2017, the Boards of Directors of PG&E Corporation and the Utility suspended quarterly cash dividends on both PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s common stock, beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as the Utility’s preferred stock, beginning the three-month period ending January 31, 2018.

On February 8, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility authorized the payment of all cumulative and unpaid dividends on the Utility’s preferred stock as of January 31, 2022 totaling $59.1 million, which was paid on May 13, 2022, to holders of record on April 29, 2022. In addition to the dividends paid in arrears, the Utility paid approximately $11 million of dividends on redeemable preferred stock during the year ended December 31, 2022. On December 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared dividends on its outstanding series of preferred stock totaling $3.5 million, which was paid on February 15, 2023, to holders of record on January 31, 2023.

On June 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility also reinstated the dividend on the Utility’s common stock and declared a common stock dividend of $425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on June 17, 2022.

On December 15, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Utility declared a common stock dividend of $425 million that was paid to PG&E Corporation on December 20, 2022. No dividend is payable until declared by the Board of Directors of the Utility.

72

Subject to the dividend restrictions described in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, any decision to declare and pay dividends on PG&E Corporation’s common stock in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions of PG&E Corporation, and other factors that the Board of Directors of PG&E Corporation may deem relevant. Pursuant to the Confirmation Order, PG&E Corporation may not pay dividends on shares of its common stock until it recognizes $6.2 billion in Non-GAAP Core Earnings following the Emergence Date. “Non-GAAP Core Earnings” means GAAP earnings adjusted for certain non-core items as described in the Plan. PG&E Corporation is unable to predict when it will commence the payment of dividends on its common stock.

Utility Cash Flows

PG&E Corporation’s consolidated cash flows consist primarily of cash flows related to the Utility. The following discussion presents the Utility’s cash flows for 2022 and 2021.

See “Liquidity and Financial Resources” in Item 7 of the 2021 Form 10-K for discussion of the Utility’s cash flows for 2021 compared to 2020.

The Utility’s cash flows were as follows:

--------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ------- - -----
 Year Ended December 31,
(in millions) 2022 2021
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 3,831 $ 2,448
Net cash used in investing activities (10,069) (7,050)
Net cash provided by financing activities 6,879 4,379
Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 641 $ (223)

Operating Activities

The Utility’s cash flows from operating activities primarily consist of receipts from customers less payments of operating expenses, other than expenses such as depreciation that do not require the use of cash.  During 2022, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.4 billion compared to the same period in 2021.  This increase was partially due to an increase in base revenues authorized in the 2020 GRC and additional revenues as authorized through the FERC formula rate and a decrease in operating and maintenance expense as a result of operating cost efficiencies. In addition, during 2022, the Utility made a payment to the Fire Victim Trust of $592 million as compared to a payment of $758 million in the same period in 2021.

Future cash flow from operating activities will be affected by various factors, including:

•the timing and amount of costs in connection with the 2019 Kincade fire, the 2020 Zogg fire, the 2021 Dixie fire, and the 2022 Mosquito fire and the timing and amount of any potential related insurance, Wildfire Fund, and regulatory recoveries;

•the timing and amounts of costs, including fines and penalties, that may be incurred in connection with current and future enforcement, litigation, and regulatory matters (see “Wildfire-Related Securities Class Action” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and “Regulatory Matters” below for more information);

•the severity, extent and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Utility’s service area, the ability of the Utility to collect on its customer receivables, the ability of the Utility’s customers to pay their utility bills in full and in a timely manner, the ability of the Utility to offset these effects, including with spending reductions, and the ability of the Utility to recover through rates any losses incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the availability or cost of financing;

•the timing and amounts of available funds to pay eligible claims for liabilities arising from future wildfires;

•the timing and amount of substantially increasing costs in connection with the 2020-2022 WMP and the costs previously incurred in connection with the 2019 WMP that are not currently being recovered through rates (see “Regulatory Matters” below for more information);

73

•the timing and amounts of available funds collected for self-insurance (see “2023 General Rate Case” in the Regulatory Matters section of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis for more information);

•the timing of the gain to be returned to customers from the sale of the SFGO and transmission tower wireless licenses and the amounts incurred related to the move to and the leasing of the Lakeside Building; and

•the timing and outcomes of the Utility’s pending and future ratemaking and regulatory proceedings, including the extent to which PG&E Corporation and the Utility are able to recover their costs through regulated rates as recorded in memorandum accounts or balancing accounts, or as otherwise requested.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on their financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources, other than those discussed under “Purchase Commitments” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $3.0 billion during 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was primarily driven by a $1.9 billion increase in capital expenditures, including additional system hardening and emergency response work performed in 2022. Additionally, the Utility purchased $1.0 billion of investments as part of the creation of the customer credit trust, with no similar purchases in 2021.

The Utility’s investing activities primarily consist of the construction of new and replacement facilities necessary to provide safe and reliable electricity and natural gas services to its customers. Cash used in investing activities also includes the proceeds from sales of nuclear decommissioning trust and customer credit trust investments which are partially offset by the amount of cash used to purchase new nuclear decommissioning trust and customer credit trust investments. The funds in the decommissioning trusts, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively for decommissioning and dismantling the Utility’s nuclear generation facilities. Pursuant to SB 901, the funds in the customer credit trust, along with accumulated earnings, are used exclusively to fund a monthly credit to customers that is anticipated to equal the fixed recovery charges such that the SB 901 securitization is designed to be rate neutral to customers.

Future cash flows used in investing activities are largely dependent on the timing and amount of capital expenditures.  The Utility estimates that it will incur between $7.9 billion and $11.2 billion in 2023. Additionally, future cash flows used in investing activities will be impacted by the timing and amount related to the intended purchase of the Lakeside Building, and the timing and amount of contributions to the customer credit trust, including shareholder tax benefits, and $1.0 billion of cash to be contributed in 2024.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $2.5 billion during 2022 as compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of $7.5 billion of SB 901 recovery bonds and a decrease of $850 million in net repayments of short-term debt. These increases were partially offset by a $5.9 billion increase in amounts paid to satisfy long-term debt outstanding in 2022 compared to the same period in 2021.

Cash provided by or used in financing activities is driven by the Utility’s financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by or used in operating activities, the level of cash provided by or used in investing activities, the conditions in the capital markets, and the maturity date or prepayment date of existing debt instruments.  Additionally, the Utility’s future cash flows from financing activities will be affected by the timing and outcome of future AB 1054 securitization transactions, the timing and outcome of the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation to one or more investors to be identified, dividend payments, and equity contributions from PG&E Corporation.

LITIGATION MATTERS

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have significant contingencies arising from their operations, including contingencies related to the enforcement and litigation matters described in Note 2, Note 15, and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 that are incorporated by reference herein. The outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material effect on PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

74

•In August 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the securitization of up to approximately $1.4 billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditures, and in November 2022, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $983 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Senior Secured Recovery Bonds. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

•In March 2022, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement for the Utility’s 2018 CEMA application approving a total revenue requirement of $683 million plus interest for its expenses and capital costs, which is approximately 90% of the Utility’s total cost recovery request.

•In February 2022, a CPUC decision finding $7.5 billion of stress test costs eligible for securitization pursuant to SB 901 and a financing order authorizing the issuance of up to $7.5 billion of recovery bonds became final and non-appealable. PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds in May and $3.9 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds in July. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

•In February 2022, the Utility served supplemental testimony for its 2023 GRC to reflect the Utility’s integrated wildfire mitigation strategy, including the Utility’s proposals for the initial phase of undergrounding 10,000 miles of electric distribution powerlines. In September 2022, the Utility submitted testimony updating the revenue requirement to reflect updates for escalation rates and federal tax law and guidance. As amended and updated, the Utility’s application requests revenue requirements of $15.82 billion and a weighted-average GRC rate base of $50.41 billion for its 2023 test year. In January 2023, the Utility filed a motion for approval of a settlement agreement for all amounts at issue in the second track of the proceeding, for $183 million in expense and $127 million of capital expenditures. Also in January 2023, the CPUC approved a settlement pursuant to which the Utility’s wildfire liability insurance will be entirely based on self-insurance beginning in 2023.

Cost Recovery Proceedings

Periodically, costs arise that could not have been anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC proceedings or that have been deliberately excluded from such requests. These costs may result from catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a memorandum account and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudently incurred. The CPUC may also authorize balancing accounts with limitations or caps to cost recovery. These accounts, which include the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTBA among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, other wildfire prevention-related costs, certain third-party wildfire claims, and insurance costs. While the Utility generally expects such costs to be recoverable, there can be no assurance that the CPUC will authorize the Utility to recover the full amount of its costs.

In recent years, the amount of the costs recorded in these accounts has increased. Because rate recovery may require CPUC authorization for these accounts, there can be a delay between when the Utility incurs costs and when it may recover those costs. As of December 31, 2022, the Utility had recorded an aggregate amount of approximately $6.2 billion in costs for the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, MGMA, and RTBA. Of these costs, approximately $856 million was authorized for recovery and accounted for as current, and $5.3 billion was accounted for as long term as of December 31, 2022. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

If the amount of the costs recorded in these accounts continues to increase or the delay between incurring and recovering costs lengthens, PG&E Corporation and the Utility may incur additional financing costs. If the Utility does not recover the full amount of its recorded costs, the difference between the recorded and recovered amounts would be written off as a non-cash disallowance. Such disallowances could materially affect PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.

Except as otherwise noted, the Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the following applications. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected if the Utility is unable to timely recover costs included in these applications.

For more information, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, “Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Cost Recovery Applications,” and “Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Application” below.

The Utility’s cost recovery proceedings for the costs described above that are pending, have pending appeals, or were completed during the year ended December 31, 2022 are summarized in the following table:

---------- -------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proceeding Request Status
2020 WMCE Revenue requirement of approximately $1.28 billion Settlement agreement to recover $1.04 billion of revenue requirement approved February 2023.
2021 WMCE Revenue requirement of approximately $1.47 billion Partial settlement agreement to recover $721 million of revenue requirement filed January 2022. Settlement excludes VMBA’s $591 million revenue requirement.
2022 WMCE Revenue requirement of approximately $1.36 billion Filed December 15, 2022.
2018 CEMA Revenue requirement of $763 million Settlement agreement to recover $683 million plus interest approved March 2022.

Wildfire Mitigation and Catastrophic Events Cost Recovery Applications

2020 WMCE Application

On September 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events (the “2020 WMCE application”). The recorded expenditures, which excluded amounts disallowed as a result of the CPUC’s decision in the OII into the multiple wildfires that began on October 8, 2017 and spread through Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma, Butte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Lake, Nevada and Yuba Counties, as well as in the area surrounding Yuba City (the “2017 Northern California wildfires”), and the 2018 Camp fire, consisted of $1.18 billion in expense and $801 million in capital expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.28 billion.

The costs addressed in the 2020 WMCE application cover activities mainly during the years 2017 to 2019 and were incremental to those previously authorized in the Utility’s 2017 GRC and other proceedings. The majority of costs addressed in this application reflected work necessary to mitigate wildfire risk and to respond to catastrophic events occurring during the years 2017 to 2019. The Utility’s requested revenue included amounts for the FHPMA of $293 million, the FRMMA and the WMPMA of $740 million, and the CEMA of $251 million.

On September 21, 2021, the Utility and certain parties filed a motion with the CPUC seeking approval of a settlement agreement that would resolve all of the issues raised by the settling parties in the 2020 WMCE application. The settlement agreement proposes that the Utility recover a revenue requirement of $1.04 billion. The settlement agreement authorizes the Utility to recover a revenue requirement of $591 million over a 24-month amortization period beginning March 2023, which is in addition to the interim rate relief of $447 million that was approved by an earlier CPUC decision. On February 2, 2023, the CPUC approved a final decision adopting the settlement agreement without modifications.

2021 WMCE Application

On September 16, 2021, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately $1.6 billion of recorded expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.47 billion (the “2021 WMCE application”). The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred primarily in 2020.

The recorded expenditures consist of $1.4 billion in expenses and $197 million in capital expenditures. The costs addressed in the 2021 WMCE application are incremental to those previously authorized in the Utility’s 2017 GRC, 2020 GRC, and other proceedings. The majority of the Utility’s proposed revenue requirement would be collected over a two-year period beginning in January 2023.

The Utility’s requested revenue requirement includes amounts recorded to the VMBA of $592 million, the CEMA of $535 million, the WMBA of $149 million, and other memorandum accounts. On November 18, 2021, the Utility filed updates to the application, increasing total costs by $19.4 million. On December 30, 2021, the Utility filed supplemental testimony reducing the cost recovery request of the COVID-19 CEMA costs by $12.2 million. The $12.2 million reduction was a result of costs, such as employee business travel expenses and in-person training costs, that the Utility was able to avoid due to the pandemic.

On January 18, 2023, the Utility, TURN, and Cal Advocates filed a joint motion for approval of a settlement agreement, pursuant to which the Utility would receive a revenue requirement of $720.7 million. The settlement agreement does not address $591.9 million recorded to the VMBA, for which cost recovery will be determined separately by the CPUC.

2022 WMCE Application

On December 15, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting cost recovery of approximately $1.36 billion of recorded expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $1.29 billion (the “2022 WMCE application”). The costs addressed in this application reflect costs related to wildfire mitigation and certain catastrophic events, as well as implementation of various customer-focused initiatives. These costs were incurred primarily in 2021.

77

The recorded expenditures consist of $1.2 billion in expenses and $136 million in capital expenditures. The costs addressed in the 2022 WMCE application are incremental to those previously authorized in the Utility’s 2020 GRC and other proceedings. In connection with the 2022 WMCE application, the Utility also requested interim rate relief of $1.1 billion to be recovered over 12 months beginning June 1, 2023. The remaining $224 million would be recovered after the CPUC issues a final decision.

The Utility has proposed a schedule that would call for a final decision by the CPUC in December 2023.

Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account Application

The CPUC allows utilities to recover the reasonable, incremental costs of responding to catastrophic events that have been declared a disaster or state of emergency by competent federal or state authorities. The Utility has historically sought such costs through standalone CEMA applications. More recently, the Utility has sought to recover CEMA-eligible costs through its WMCE applications.

In addition to the Utility’s responsibilities in responding to catastrophic events, in 2014, the CPUC directed the Utility to perform additional fire prevention and vegetation management work in response to the severe drought in California. Through 2019, the costs associated with this work were tracked in the CEMA. In the 2020 GRC decision, the CPUC required the Utility to track these costs in the VMBA for the period beginning January 1, 2020.

2018 CEMA Application

On March 30, 2018, the Utility submitted to the CPUC its 2018 CEMA application requesting cost recovery of $183 million in connection with seven catastrophic events that included fire and storm declared emergencies from mid-2016 through early 2017, as well as $405 million related to work performed in 2016 and 2017 to cut back or remove dead or dying trees that were exposed to years of drought conditions and bark beetle infestation. The Utility filed three revisions to this application, resulting in a total cost recovery request of $763 million.

On April 25, 2019, the CPUC approved the Utility’s request for interim rate relief, allowing for recovery of $373 million of costs as requested by the Utility at that time. The interim rate relief was implemented, commencing on October 1, 2019.

On March 17, 2022, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement authorizing the Utility to collect a total of $683 million plus interest for the 2018 CEMA application. As noted above, $373 million of the total amount had already been collected in interim rates. The interim rates became final and are no longer subject to refund. The remainder of the authorized revenue requirement will be amortized over a 12-month period, which began on June 1, 2022.

Forward-Looking Rate Cases

The Utility routinely participates in forward-looking rate case applications before the CPUC and the FERC. Those applications include GRCs, where the revenue required for general operations (“base revenue”) of the Utility is assessed and reset. In addition, the Utility is periodically involved in “cost of capital” proceedings to adjust its regulated return on rate base. The Utility’s future earnings will depend on the revenue requirements authorized in such rate cases.

Decisions in GRC proceedings have historically been expected prior to the commencement of the period to which the rates would apply. In recent years, decisions in GRC proceedings have been delayed. Delayed decisions may cause the Utility to develop its budgets based on approved revenue requirements and possible outcomes, rather than authorized amounts. When decisions are delayed, the CPUC typically provides rate relief to the Utility effective as of the commencement of the rate case period (not effective as of the date of the delayed decision). Nonetheless, the Utility’s spending during the period of the delay may exceed the authorized amount, without an ability for the Utility to seek cost recovery of such excess. If the Utility’s spending during the period of the delay is less than the authorized amount, the Utility could be exposed to operational and financial risk associated with the lower level of work achieved compared to that funded by the CPUC.

Except as otherwise noted, the Utility is unable to predict the timing and outcome of the following applications. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows could be materially affected depending on the outcomes of these applications.

78

The Utility’s forward-looking rate cases that are pending, have pending appeals, or were completed during the year ended December 31, 2022 are summarized in the following table:

-------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rate Case Request Status
2023 GRC Revenue requirement of $15.82 billion for 2023 A decision is scheduled for the third quarter of 2023.
2022 Cost of Capital Leave cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for 2022 Final decision issued November 2022, leaving the cost of capital components at pre-2022 levels for 2022. Intervenors filed application for rehearing in December 2022.
2023 Cost of Capital Increase ROE to 11% and cost of debt to 4.31% Final decision issued December 2022, adopting a 10% ROE. Intervenor filed application for rehearing in January 2023.
2015 GT&S Revenue requirement of $416 million related to 2011-2014 capital expenditures subject to audit Final decision issued July 2022 approving settlement to recover $356 million of revenue requirements.

2023 General Rate Case

On June 30, 2021, the Utility filed its 2023 GRC application with the CPUC (“the Original Application”). The 2023 GRC combined what had historically been separated into the GRC and GT&S rate cases. In a GRC, the CPUC approves annual revenue requirements for the first year (a “test year”) of the GRC period and typically authorizes the Utility to receive annual increases in revenue requirements for the subsequent years of the GRC period (known as “attrition years”). In the 2023 GRC, the CPUC will determine the annual amount of base revenues that the Utility will be authorized to collect from customers from 2023 through 2026 to recover its anticipated costs for gas distribution, gas transmission and storage, electric distribution, and electric generation and to provide the Utility an opportunity to earn its authorized rate of return. The Utility’s revenue requirements for other portions of its operations, such as electric transmission, and electricity, natural gas and power purchases, are authorized in other regulatory proceedings overseen by the CPUC or the FERC. In the Original Application, the Utility proposed a series of safety, resiliency, and clean energy investments to further reduce wildfire risk and deliver safe, reliable, and clean energy service.

Between August 2021 and January 2022, the Utility served various updates to its 2023 GRC testimony. On February 25, 2022 and February 28, 2022, the Utility served supplemental testimony for its 2023 GRC to reflect the Utility’s integrated wildfire mitigation strategy, including the Utility’s proposals for the initial phase of undergrounding 10,000 miles of electric distribution powerlines in high fire risk areas throughout the Utility’s service area, the EPSS program, and its EVM program. On March 10, 2022, the Utility filed an amended application that revised and superseded the revenue requirement request in the Original Application. On September 6, 2022, the Utility submitted testimony updating the revenue requirement request in its 2023 GRC proceeding. The testimony reflected updates for escalation rates and federal tax law and guidance since the filing of the Original Application. On December 9, 2022, the Utility submitted a post-hearing reply brief. In the reply brief, the Utility updated the revenue requirement request due to the wildfire insurance settlement dated October 7, 2022 discussed below, stipulations with the parties regarding several disputed issues, and a reduction to the Utility’s forecast for wildfire system hardening mileage targets over the 2023 to 2026 rate case period.

As amended and updated, the Utility’s application requests revenue requirements of $15.82 billion and a weighted-average GRC rate base of $50.41 billion for its 2023 test year. The tables below compare the requested revenue requirements and rate base for the GRC period from 2023 through 2026 to those adopted for 2022 in the 2020 GRC and 2019 GT&S proceedings:

---------------------------------------- ---------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- ---- ----- ----- ----- - -----
(in billions) 2022(as adopted) 2023 2024 2025 2026
Requested revenue requirement $ 12.21 $ 15.82 $ 16.74 $ 17.18 $ 17.43
Requested weighted-average GRC rate base 39.21 50.41 55.39 59.56 63.68

Over the GRC period of 2023 through 2026, the Utility plans to make average annual capital investments of approximately $9.69 billion in gas distribution, transmission and storage, electric distribution, and electric generation infrastructure, and to improve safety, reliability, and customer service.

79

On July 22, 2022, the Utility submitted a request for the second track of this proceeding, requesting cost recovery of recorded expenditures related primarily to the safety and reliability of the Utility’s gas transmission and storage system incurred from January 2015 to December 2021. The recorded expenditures consist of $206 million in expenses and $129 million in capital expenditures, resulting in a proposed revenue requirement of approximately $241 million, most of which is proposed to be collected over a two-year period beginning August 1, 2023. On January 6, 2023, the Utility and the Public Advocates Office of the CPUC filed a motion for approval of a settlement agreement for all amounts at issue in the second track of the proceeding. In the motion, the parties requested that the CPUC approve $183 million in expense and $127 million of capital expenditures for recovery through rates.

On January 12, 2023, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement among the Utility and two parties to the proceeding pursuant to which the Utility’s wildfire liability insurance will be entirely based on self-insurance beginning in 2023. The self-insurance will be funded through CPUC-jurisdictional rates at $400 million for test year 2023 and subsequent years until $1.0 billion of unimpaired self-insurance is reached. If losses are incurred, the settlement agreement contains an adjustment mechanism designed to adjust customer funded self-insurance based on the amount of wildfire related liabilities incurred in the previous year. For 2024, 2025, and 2026, if the estimated claims for wildfire events from the immediately preceding year exceed the amount collected for self-insurance in that same year, the self-insurance amount to be collected in rates during the following year would increase by 50% of the difference between the self-insurance amount collected and estimated claims for events in the immediately preceding year. As a result, the Utility could collect the self-insurance amounts over a longer period than it makes wildfire-related payments. The settlement agreement includes a five percent deductible, capped at a maximum of $50 million, on claims that are incurred each year. The settlement agreement prohibits the Utility from purchasing additional wildfire liability insurance from the commercial insurance market.

The Utility does not seek recovery of compensation of PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s officers within the scope of 17 Code of Federal Regulations 240.3b-7.

The CPUC’s schedule indicated a final decision on the first two tracks of this proceeding would be issued in the third quarter of 2023.

Cost of Capital Proceedings

2020 and 2022 Cost of Capital Applications

On December 19, 2019, the CPUC approved a final decision in the 2020 cost of capital application (the “2020 cost of capital application”), maintaining the Utility’s ROE at the 2019 level of 10.25% for the three-year period beginning January 1, 2020. The decision maintained the common equity component of the Utility’s capital structure (i.e., the relative weightings of common equity, preferred equity, and debt for ratemaking) at 52% and reduced its preferred stock component from 1% to 0.5%. The decision also approved the cost of debt requested by the Utility.

On August 23, 2021, the Utility filed an off-cycle 2022 cost of capital application with the CPUC. The Utility also concurrently filed a motion requesting that the revenue requirement for the 2022 cost of capital be recorded in memorandum accounts to be trued-up following a final decision in this proceeding. On October 28, 2021, the CPUC ruled that the Utility was required to comply with the cost of capital mechanism for 2022.

On November 3, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision, finding that an extraordinary event occurred, and that the cost of capital adjustment mechanism should not be implemented for 2022. The final decision retains the cost of capital for 2022 previously authorized in the 2020 cost of capital proceeding, as adjusted, and closes this proceeding. On December 5, 2022, intervenors filed an application for rehearing. On December 20, 2022, the Utility filed a response to the application for rehearing.

For more information regarding this proceeding, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

2023 Cost of Capital Application

On April 20, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC requesting that the CPUC authorize the Utility’s cost of capital for its electric generation, electric distribution, natural gas distribution, and natural gas transmission and storage rate base beginning on January 1, 2023 (the “2023 cost of capital application”).

80

In its 2023 cost of capital application, the Utility requested that the CPUC approve the Utility’s proposed ratemaking capital structure (i.e., the relative weightings of common equity, preferred equity, and debt for ratemaking), ROE, cost of preferred stock, and cost of debt.

On December 19, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision adopting a new cost of capital. On January 10, 2023, the CPUC issued a decision correcting certain typographical errors in the final decision.

The following table compares the currently authorized capital structure and rates of return with those adopted in the final decision for 2023, as corrected.

-------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------- - ----------------------------- ----- ------------- ---- ---- - ----------------- ----- ------------- - ----- ---- - ---- -
 2022 authorized by the 2022 Cost of Capital Application 2023 Cost of Capital decision
 Cost Capital structure Weighted cost Cost Capital structure Weighted cost
Common equity 10.25 % 52.00 % 5.33 % 10.00 % 52.00 % 5.20 %
Preferred stock 5.52 % 0.50 % 0.03 % 5.52 % 0.50 % 0.03 %
Long-term debt 4.17 % 47.50 % 1.98 % 4.31 % 47.50 % 2.05 %
Weighted average cost of capital 100.00 % 7.34 % 100.00 % 7.28 %

For 2023, the Utility expects that the newly-adopted cost of capital will result in revenue requirement decreases of approximately $23 million for electric generation and distribution and $10 million for gas distribution operations, assuming 2022 authorized rate base amounts from the 2020 GRC decision. The revenues for the gas transmission and storage operations will decrease by approximately $7 million, assuming 2022 authorized rate base amounts from the 2019 GT&S decision. Actual revenue requirement changes resulting from the Utility’s requested ROE for the period beyond 2022 may differ from the amounts reflected above, pending the outcome of the 2023 GRC.

The 2023 cost of capital application also requested that the CPUC approve an upward adjustment above the three-month commercial paper rate for interest on the Utility’s balancing and memorandum accounts to reflect the Utility’s actual cost of short-term debt. The Utility requested that the adjustment be set on an annual basis effective January 1 of each year based on the average difference between the three-month commercial paper rate and the Utility’s actual cost of short-term debt over the preceding twelve-month period from November through October. The Utility included an illustrative calculation using the period March 2021 to February 2022 with an adjustment to increase the rate by 153 basis points, which would result in an estimated $69 million increase in recovery of short-term financing costs associated with its recent balancing and memorandum account balances. The actual revenue requirement impact of the short-term debt proposal would differ depending on the final adjustment set each year and the recorded balances in the balancing and memorandum accounts. The decision deferred consideration of the proposal to a second phase of the proceeding.

The cost of capital that is approved in this proceeding is expected to be effective until December 31, 2025, unless the cost of capital adjustment mechanism is triggered. (For more information on the cost of capital adjustment mechanism, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.)

On January 18, 2023, an intervenor filed an application for rehearing of the final decision. On February 2, 2023, the Utility filed a response to the application for rehearing.

2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case

On June 23, 2016, the CPUC approved a final phase one decision in the Utility’s 2015 GT&S rate case. The phase one decision excluded from rate base $696 million of 2011 to 2014 capital spending in excess of the amount adopted in the prior GT&S rate case. The decision permanently disallowed $120 million of that amount and ordered that the remaining $576 million be subject to an audit overseen by the CPUC staff, with the possibility that the Utility may seek recovery in a future proceeding. The audit report was released June 2, 2020 and did not recommend any additional disallowances. The 2015 GT&S decision authorized the Utility to seek recovery, through a separate application, of those costs not recommended for disallowance by the audit.

81

On July 31, 2020, the Utility filed an application seeking recovery of $416 million in 2015 to 2022 revenue associated with $512 million of recorded capital expenditures. On July 7, 2021, the Utility filed a joint motion to adopt a settlement agreement reached with the active parties in the proceeding. On July 14, 2022, the CPUC approved a final decision approving the settlement agreement, which resolved all issues in this proceeding and authorized a $356 million revenue requirement for the period of 2015 through 2022. Of this amount, $313 million of revenues for the period 2015 through 2021 will be amortized in rates over 60 months and $43 million associated with 2022 will be amortized in rates over 12 months beginning August 1, 2022. Going forward, the as-yet undepreciated capital plant associated with this application was included in test year 2023 rate base in the Utility’s consolidated 2023 GRC.

Transmission Owner Rate Cases

Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016 (the “TO16” and “TO17” rate cases, respectively)

On January 8, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion granting an appeal of the FERC’s decisions in the TO16 and TO17 rate cases that had granted the Utility a 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for its continued participation in the CAISO. If the FERC concluded on remand that the Utility should no longer be authorized to receive the 50-basis point ROE incentive adder, the Utility would incur a refund obligation of $1 million and $8.5 million for TO16 and TO17, respectively. Those rate case decisions were remanded to the FERC for further proceedings consistent with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ opinion.

On July 18, 2019, the FERC issued its order on remand reaffirming its prior grant of the Utility’s request for the 50-basis point ROE adder.

On March 17, 2020, the FERC issued its order denying requests for rehearing that were previously filed by several parties. On May 11, 2020, the CPUC and a number of other parties filed a petition for review of the FERC’s orders in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

On March 17, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FERC’s order granting the Utility the 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for CAISO participation. The order would extinguish the Utility’s refund obligations that might have been required under the TO16 and TO17 rate cases had the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals not found in the FERC’s favor. On May 2, 2022, the CPUC filed a petition for panel rehearing of the order. On May 25, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision denying the request for rehearing and the request for a rehearing en banc.

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2017 (the “TO18” rate case)

On July 29, 2016, the Utility filed its TO18 rate case with the FERC requesting a 2017 retail electric transmission revenue requirement of $1.72 billion, a $387 million increase over the 2016 revenue requirement of $1.33 billion.  The forecasted network transmission rate base for 2017 was $6.7 billion.  The Utility sought a ROE of 10.9%, which included an incentive component of 50-basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO.

On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order that, among other things, rejected the Utility’s direct assignment of common plant to FERC and required the allocation of all common plant between CPUC and FERC jurisdiction be based on operating and maintenance labor ratios. The order reopened the record for the limited purpose of allowing the participants to the proceeding an opportunity to present written evidence concerning the FERC’s revised ROE methodology adopted in FERC Opinion No. 569-A, issued on May 21, 2020.

On December 17, 2020 and June 17, 2021, the FERC issued orders denying requests for rehearing submitted by the Utility and intervenors. In 2021, the Utility filed four appeals. The appeals related to two issues: (1) impact of the Tax Act on TO18 rates in January and February 2018 and (2) aspects of the rehearing order other than the Tax Act. The appeals have been consolidated and are being held in abeyance until the FERC addresses the ROE issue on rehearing.

As a result of an order denying rehearing on the common plant allocation, the Utility increased its regulatory liabilities for amounts previously collected during the TO18, TO19, and TO20 rate case periods from 2017 through 2022 by approximately $416 million. A portion of these common plant costs are expected to be recovered at the CPUC in a separate application and as a result, as of December 31, 2022, the Utility had recorded approximately $258 million to Regulatory assets.

82

On March 17, 2022, the FERC issued a further order in the TO18 rate case proceeding finding that 9.26% is the just and reasonable base ROE for the Utility. With the incentive component of 50-basis points for the Utility’s continuing participation in the CAISO, the resulting ROE would be 9.76%. As a result, the Utility increased its regulatory liability for the potential refund for TO18 by $30 million in 2022. On April 18, 2022, the Utility sought rehearing of the FERC’s determination of the base ROE finding. On May 16, 2022 and May 31, 2022, the Utility filed a compliance filing and a refund report describing the adjustments made to the transmission revenue requirement, adjusted rates, and the calculation and mechanism of the refunds. On May 19, 2022, the FERC denied all parties’ rehearing requests. The Utility has filed an appeal in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, as have the other parties that sought rehearing. The appeal is being held in abeyance until the FERC issues a substantive order on rehearing on the ROE issue.

Aside from the ultimate outcome of the ROE rehearing request and the common plant allocation, the FERC’s orders in the TO18 proceeding are not expected to result in a material impact on the Utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Some of the issues that will be decided in a final and unappealable TO18 decision, including the common plant allocation, will also be incorporated into the Utility’s TO19 and TO20 rate cases. The ROE rehearing request will not impact the TO20 rate case. See “Transmission Owner Rate Case Revenue Subject to Refund” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2018 (the “TO19” rate case)

On July 27, 2017, the Utility filed its TO19 rate case with the FERC. On December 20, 2018, the FERC issued an order approving an all-party settlement filed by the Utility. As part of the settlement, the TO19 revenue requirement will be set at 98.85% of the revenue requirement for TO18 that will be determined upon the issuance of a final, non-appealable TO18 decision. On March 17, 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FERC’s order granting the Utility the 50-basis point ROE incentive adder for CAISO participation and eliminating the refund obligation, and so the Utility was not obligated to make a refund to customers based on this matter. See “Transmission Owner Rate Cases for 2015 and 2016” above for a discussion of the incentive adder. As a result of the potential reduction to the TO18 revenue requirement, the Utility increased its regulatory liability for the potential refund for TO19 by $32 million in the first quarter of 2022. On April 18, 2022, the Utility sought rehearing of the FERC’s determination of the base ROE finding.

Transmission Owner Rate Case for 2019 (the “TO20” rate case)

On October 1, 2018, the Utility filed its TO20 rate case with the FERC requesting approval of a formula rate for the costs associated with the Utility’s electric transmission facilities. On November 30, 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting the Utility’s October 2018 filing, subject to hearings and refund, and established May 1, 2019 as the effective date for rate changes. The FERC also ordered that the hearings be held in abeyance pending settlement discussions among the parties.

On March 31, 2020, the Utility filed a partial settlement with the FERC, which the FERC approved on August 17, 2020. On October 15, 2020, the Utility filed a settlement with the FERC resolving all of the remaining issues in the formula rate proceedings, including the Utility’s ROE, capital structure, depreciation rates, as well as certain other aspects of the Utility’s formula rate. Specifically, the settlement established an all-in ROE of 10.45%; a fixed capital structure of 49.75% common stock, 49.75% debt, and 0.5% preferred stock; and fixed depreciation rates for various categories of transmission facilities (represented by individual FERC accounts). The term of the settlement continues until December 31, 2023 and the Utility will be required to file a replacement rate filing by October 18, 2023 to be effective on January 1, 2024.

On December 30, 2020, the FERC approved the settlement without modification.

Some of the issues that will be decided in a final and unappealable TO18 decision, including the common plant allocation, will also be incorporated into the Utility’s TO20 rate case.

Under its formula rate, the Utility submits an annual update to the FERC each December for rates to go into effect on January 1 of the following year. Parties have protested the Utility’s annual updates, and these protests are pending before the FERC.

Other Regulatory Proceedings

Enhanced Oversight and Enforcement Process

In the OII to Consider PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Plan of Reorganization final decision, the CPUC adopted an EOEP designed to provide a roadmap for how the CPUC will monitor the Utility’s operational performance on an ongoing basis. The EOEP contains six steps that are triggered by specific events and includes enhanced reporting requirements and additional monitoring and oversight. These trigger events include failure to obtain an approved WMP, failure to comply with regulatory reporting requirements in the WMP, insufficient progress toward approved safety or risk-driven investments and failure to comply with or demonstrate sufficient progress toward certain metrics. The EOEP also contains provisions for the Utility to cure and permanently exit the EOEP if it can satisfy specific criteria. If the Utility is placed into the EOEP, actions taken would occur in coordination with the CPUC’s existing formal and informal reporting requirements and procedures. The EOEP does not replace or limit the CPUC’s regulatory authority, including the authority to issue Orders to Show Cause and OIIs and to impose fines and penalties. The EOEP requires the Utility to report the occurrence of a triggering event to the CPUC’s executive director no later than five business days after the date on which any member of senior management of the Utility becomes aware of the occurrence of a triggering event.

The Utility is unable to predict whether fines or penalties may be imposed, or other regulatory actions may be taken.

Vegetation Management

The CPUC placed the Utility into step 1 of the EOEP on April 15, 2021 and imposed additional reporting requirements on the Utility. The CPUC’s resolution states that a step 1 triggering event had occurred because the Utility had “made insufficient progress toward approved safety or risk-driven investments related to its electric business.” The resolution found that, based on the CPUC’s evaluation of the Utility’s EVM work in 2020, the Utility was “not sufficiently prioritizing its Enhanced Vegetation Management (“EVM”) based on risk” and was “not making risk-driven investments.” The resolution also found that “less than five percent of the EVM work” the Utility completed in 2020 “was on the 20 highest risk power lines according to its own risk rankings.”

As required by the CPUC’s resolution, the Utility submitted a corrective action plan to the CPUC’s Executive Director on May 6, 2021, which was designed to correct or prevent recurrence of the step 1 triggering event, or otherwise mitigate any ongoing safety risk or impact, as soon as practicable, among other things. The corrective action plan addressed the EVM situation that occurred in 2020 and provided a risk-informed EVM work plan for 2021. The Utility was required to update the information contained in the corrective action plan every 90 days, which it did.

On December 1, 2022, the CPUC issued a resolution authorizing the Utility’s exit from the EOEP.

Application for Post-Emergence SB 901 Securitization Transaction

SB 901, signed into law on September 21, 2018, requires the CPUC to establish a CHT, directing the CPUC to limit certain disallowances in the aggregate so that they do not exceed the maximum amount that the Utility can pay without harming customers or materially impacting its ability to provide adequate and safe service. SB 901 also authorizes the CPUC to issue a financing order that permits recovery, through the issuance of recovery bonds (also referred to as “securitization”), of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the CHT.

Pursuant to SB 901 and the CPUC’s methodology adopted in the CHT OIR, on April 30, 2020, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a post-emergence transaction to recover $7.5 billion of 2017 wildfire claims costs through securitization that is designed to be rate neutral to customers through the creation of a corresponding customer credit trust, with the proceeds used to pay or reimburse the Utility for the payment of wildfire claims costs associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires. Among other uses, as a result of the proposed transaction, the Utility would retire $6.0 billion of Utility debt. Specifically, the application requested administration of the stress test methodology approved in the CHT OIR and a determination that $7.5 billion in 2017 catastrophic wildfire costs and expenses are stress test costs and eligible for securitization. In this context, a “securitization” refers to a financing transaction where a special purpose financing vehicle issues new debt that is secured by the proceeds of a new recovery charge to Utility customers. The application also proposed a customer credit designed to equal the bond charges over the life of the bonds, which would insulate customers from the charge on customer bills associated with the bonds.

84

On April 23, 2021, the CPUC issued a decision finding that $7.5 billion of the Utility’s 2017 catastrophic wildfire costs and expenses are stress test costs that may be financed through the issuance of recovery bonds pursuant to Public Utilities Code sections 850 et seq. and approving a structure for the transaction. As requested, the decision authorized the Utility to establish a customer credit trust funded by PG&E Corporation’s shareholders, that will provide a monthly credit to customers that is anticipated to equal the securitized charges such that the securitization is designed to be rate neutral to customers. Subject to retention of the CPUC’s existing jurisdiction, the decision adopted a transaction structure comprised of four elements: (1) an initial shareholder contribution of $2.0 billion, $1.0 billion of which was contributed in 2022 and $1.0 billion to be contributed in 2024; (2) up to $7.59 billion of additional contributions funded by certain shareholder tax benefits; (3) a single CPUC review of the balance of the customer credit trust in 2040, with a single contingent supplemental shareholder contribution, if needed, up to $775 million in 2040; and (4) sharing with customers 25% of any surplus of shareholder assets in the customer credit trust at the end of the life of the trust.

In addition, on January 6, 2021, the Utility filed an additional application requesting that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing the issuance of one or more series of recovery bonds in connection with the post-emergence transaction to finance, using securitization, the $7.5 billion of claims associated with the 2017 Northern California wildfires, which the CPUC subsequently granted on May 11, 2021.

On February 28, 2022, the decision finding $7.5 billion of stress test costs eligible for securitization and the financing order authorizing the issuance of up to $7.5 billion of recovery bonds became final and non-appealable. The financing order authorized the issuance of bonds through the end of 2022. PG&E Wildfire Recovery Funding LLC issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Recovery Bonds on May 10, 2022 and $3.9 billion aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-B Recovery Bonds on July 20, 2022. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Application for Second AB 1054 Securitization Transaction

AB 1054 provides that the first $5.0 billion expended in the aggregate by California’s three large electric IOUs on fire risk mitigation capital expenditures included in their respective approved WMPs will be excluded from their respective equity rate bases. The $5.0 billion of capital expenditures has been allocated among the large electric IOUs in accordance with their Wildfire Fund allocation metrics. The Utility’s allocation is $3.21 billion. AB 1054 contemplates that such capital expenditures may be financed using a structure that securitizes a dedicated customer charge. Pursuant to an earlier financing order issued by the CPUC authorizing the Utility’s initial application for AB 1054 securitization transaction, on November 12, 2021, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $860 million of senior secured recovery bonds. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

On March 11, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC seeking authorization for a second transaction to securitize up to $1.7 billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditure amounts that have been or would be incurred by the Utility from 2019 through 2022. The $1.7 billion reflected $212 million recorded and $1.16 billion forecasted capital expenditure amounts that were approved by the CPUC in the 2020 GRC and up to $350 million capital expenditure amounts pending in the 2020 WMCE proceeding. On May 4, 2022, the $350 million of capital expenditure amounts were removed because the CPUC extended the schedule in the 2020 WMCE proceeding such that a final decision approving such capital expenditure amounts in that proceeding was no longer expected prior to the issuance of a financing order authorizing the second AB 1054 securitization transaction.  The final amount to be securitized would be based on actual recorded capital expenditures incurred by the Utility prior to the securitization transaction.

The application requested that the CPUC issue a financing order authorizing one or more series of recovery bonds, determine that the issuance of the bonds and collection through fixed recovery charges is just and reasonable, consistent with the public interest, would reduce rates on a present-value basis compared to traditional utility financing mechanisms, and authorize the Utility to collect a non-bypassable charge sufficient to pay debt service on the recovery bonds.  The application also requested that the CPUC exclude the securitized debt from the Utility’s ratemaking capital structure and adjust the Utility’s 2020 GRC revenue requirements following the issuance of the recovery bonds.

On August 5, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision approving the securitization of up to approximately $1.4 billion of fire risk mitigation capital expenditures, which was the amount requested in the application less the $350 million then pending in the 2020 WMCE proceeding.

On November 30, 2022, PG&E Recovery Funding LLC issued approximately $983 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2022-A Senior Secured Recovery Bonds.

85

2020-2022 Wildfire Mitigation Plan

The Utility’s 2022 WMP was submitted on February 25, 2022. The 2022 WMP addressed the Utility’s wildfire safety programs and initiatives focused on reducing the potential for catastrophic wildfires related to electrical equipment, reducing the potential for fires to spread, and reducing the impact of PSPS events. On November 10, 2022, OEIS approved the Utility’s 2022 WMP. On December 15, 2022, the CPUC ratified OEIS’s approval.

On December 5, 2022, OEIS issued its draft Annual Report on Compliance (“ARC”) for the Utility’s 2020 WMP. In the draft ARC, OEIS found that the Utility undertook significant efforts to reduce its wildfire risk and, in many instances, achieved its stated objectives and targets but found that the Utility failed to meet targets highly correlated with risk, failed to achieve critical stated objectives, and failed to sufficiently address risk on its system. Consequently, OEIS found the Utility did not substantially comply with the WMP during the 2020 compliance period. The Utility submitted comments on the draft ARC in December 2022. If the OEIS final ARC report maintains the finding that the Utility failed to substantially comply with its 2020 WMP, the Utility may seek judicial review. If the ARC finds that the Utility did not substantially comply with the WMP during the 2020 compliance period, the CPUC is required to issue penalties for the finding of noncompliance. PG&E Corporation and the Utility cannot reasonably estimate at this time whether they will incur a loss in connection with the ARC or the amount of any such loss, as OEIS has not issued the final ARC and because any penalty issued by CPUC depends upon a number of factors.

Electric Integrated Resource Planning and Related Procurement

On November 13, 2019, the CPUC issued a decision that takes a number of steps to address the potential for system RA shortages beginning in 2021. The decision required incremental procurement of system-level qualifying RA capacity of 3,300 MWs by all LSEs operating within the CAISO’s balancing area for the period from 2021 to 2023, of which the Utility is responsible for 716.9 MWs for its bundled customer portion. The decision required that at least 50% of LSEs resource responsibilities come online by August 1, 2021, at least 75% by August 1, 2022, and the remaining by August 1, 2023. Additionally, the decision directed the IOUs to act as the backstop procurement agent for CCAs and energy service providers that choose not to voluntarily self-procure or that fail to meet their procurement responsibilities after electing to self-provide their assigned MWs of system RA capacity under the decision.

On June 30, 2021, the CPUC issued a mid-term reliability decision to address incremental electric system reliability needs between 2024 and 2026 due to, in part, the pending retirement of once-through-cooling natural gas plants in Southern California and the possible retirement of Diablo Canyon by requiring at least 11,500 MW of additional net qualifying capacity to be procured by LSEs. See “Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations” below. The decision set procurement requirements of 2,000 MW by 2023, an additional 6,000 MW by 2024, an additional 1,500 MW by 2025, and an additional 2,000 MW by 2026. The decision set the Utility’s share of the procurement at 2,302 MW of incremental net qualifying capacity.

On April 21, 2022, the CPUC approved a group of nine long-term RA agreements to meet a portion of the Utility’s procurement requirements under the CPUC’s mid-term reliability decision. The agreements are each for a term of 15 years and collectively expected to supply 1,598.7 MW of lithium-ion energy storage capacity with some projects expected to be operational in 2023 and others in 2024.

OIR to Revisit Net Energy Metering Tariffs

On August 17, 2020, the CPUC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to develop a successor to the existing NEM tariffs. The successor tariff is being developed pursuant to the requirements of AB 327. Under AB 327, the successor to the existing NEM tariffs should provide customer-generators with credit or compensation for electricity generated by their renewable facilities based on the value of that generation to all customers and allow customer-sited renewable generation to grow sustainably among different types of customers.

86

On November 10, 2022, the CPUC withdrew a previously-issued PD and issued a new PD. On December 19, 2022, the CPUC issued a final decision. The final decision will reduce the NEM subsidy by, in large part, reducing the bill credits for exported energy to avoided cost levels for new customers interconnecting under the successor tariff established by the final decision. For new non-CARE customers interconnecting under the successor tariff, the subsidy is reduced by about 60% for standalone solar and about 45% for solar-paired storage. The decision will also reduce the subsidy for new commercial customers interconnecting under the successor tariff by about 35%. The decision declined to adopt a charge to recover grid and infrastructure costs for new or existing customers and, instead, defers to the ongoing Demand Flexibility OIR, which is considering income-based fixed charges for all customers. The decision does, however, clarify that charges adopted in the Demand Flexibility OIR will apply to NEM and successor tariff customers. The final decision does not reform the legacy period for existing NEM customers.

On January 18, 2023, intervenors filed an application for rehearing. On February 2, 2023, the Utility filed a response to the application for rehearing.

Application with Pacific Generation LLC for Approval to Transfer Non-Nuclear Generation Assets

On September 28, 2022, the Utility filed an application with the CPUC regarding the separation of the Utility’s non-nuclear generation assets into a newly formed, stand-alone Utility subsidiary, Pacific Generation. The application, which was filed jointly with Pacific Generation, seeks to establish Pacific Generation as a separate, rate-regulated utility subject to regulation by the CPUC and contemplates the potential sale of a minority interest in Pacific Generation to one or more investors to be identified. The application proposes that the negotiated transaction documents would be submitted to the CPUC via an advice letter.

On December 13, 2022, the Utility filed applications with a similar request with the FERC and also filed a related application with the FERC requesting the transfer of certain hydro licenses to Pacific Generation.

On January 20, 2023, the CPUC issued a scoping memo pursuant to which a PD would be issued by November 2023.

Self-Reports to the CPUC

The Utility self-reports potential violations of certain requirements to the CPUC. The Utility could face penalties, enforcement actions, or other adverse legal or regulatory consequences for these potential violations, including under the EOEP. The Utility is unable to predict the likelihood and the amount of potential fines or penalties, if any, related to these matters.

Electric Asset Inspections

The Utility has notified the CPUC of various errors relating to inspections and maintenance of its electric assets or implementation of WMP initiatives. These notices include missed inspections or the inability to locate records evidencing performance of inspections required under CPUC GOs 95 and 165 and errors regarding reporting meeting targets set by the Utility’s 2020 WMP. In these notices, the Utility describes the failures and corrective actions the Utility is taking to remediate these issues and to prevent recurrence. Among other corrective measures, the Utility has developed short-term and longer-term systemic corrective actions to address these errors, including performing enhanced inspections for poles with outdated or incomplete GO 165 inspection records and strengthening the Utility’s asset registry, as well as corrective actions regarding reporting on the progress toward WMP targets.

On October 26, 2022, the Utility notified the CPUC that the Utility’s procedure for wood pole replacements did not comply with CPUC requirements for replacement of poles under certain conditions and, accordingly, in some instances, the Utility failed to replace wood poles with safety factors below the required minimum. Among other short- and longer-term corrective measures, the Utility is replacing identified poles on a risk prioritized basis and revising its wood pole replacement procedures in alignment with CPUC requirements. On December 22, 2022, the Utility submitted an update to the CPUC explaining the Utility had identified a population of wood poles that had not received intrusive inspections in accordance with GO 165’s deadlines due to legacy issues, which should no longer be an issue due to changes in Utility procedures. In addition to its plan to complete the intrusive tests by September 30, 2023, the Utility is performing an end-to-end assessment of the wood pole test and treat program to proactively identify and address potential issues.

The Utility continues to evaluate whether there are additional failures to comply with GO 95 and 165, beyond those identified in submitted self-reports. The Utility intends to update the CPUC upon completion of its reviews and to address any issues it identifies.

87

Order Instituting an Investigation into PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s Safety Culture

On August 27, 2015, the CPUC began a formal investigation into whether the organizational culture and governance of PG&E Corporation and the Utility prioritize safety and adequately direct resources to promote accountability and achieve safety goals and standards (the “Safety Culture OII”). The CPUC directed the SED to evaluate the Utility’s and PG&E Corporation’s organizational culture, governance, policies, practices, and accountability metrics in relation to the Utility’s record of operations, including its record of safety incidents.

On June 18, 2019, the CPUC issued a ruling requesting comments from parties on four proposals that it stated may improve the safety culture of PG&E Corporation and the Utility. The four proposals are: separating the Utility into gas and electric utilities (including, as one possibility, sale of the gas assets to a third party); establishing periodic review of the Utility’s certificate of convenience and necessity; modifying or eliminating PG&E Corporation’s holding company structure; and linking the Utility’s rate of return or ROE to safety performance metrics.

On September 4, 2020, the administrative law judge issued a ruling updating case status, which states that the proceeding will remain open as a vehicle to monitor the progress of the Utility in improving its safety culture and to address any relevant issues that arise, with the CPUC’s consultant continuing in a monitoring role. The ruling states that additional issues may be raised in the proceedings by parties or the CPUC.

Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations

On September 2, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 846, which supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030, with the potential for an earlier retirement date. Under the legislation, the Utility would continue to operate Diablo Canyon on behalf of all CPUC-jurisdictional LSEs, and all customers of those LSEs would be responsible for the cost of extended operations. Additionally, the State of California has authorized a loan of up to $1.4 billion pursuant to SB 846 to the Utility from the DWR to support the extension of plant operations, which is in addition to the amount discussed in “Assembly Bill 180”, below. SB 846 further directs the Utility to take steps to secure funds from the DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program, and any other potentially available federal funding, to repay the loan. The loan may be forgiven under certain circumstances. On October 18, 2022, the Utility executed the loan agreement with the DWR.

On September 2, 2022, the Utility applied for federal funding through the DOE’s Civil Nuclear Credit Program. On November 17, 2022, the DOE conditionally selected the Utility to receive funding of up to $1.1 billion as part of the program. Final terms are subject to negotiation and finalization by the DOE. SB 846 provides that within 180 days of the filing of the DOE application, the CEC, in consultation with the CAISO and the CPUC, shall make a determination in a public process of whether the state’s electricity forecasts for the calendar years from 2024 through 2030 show potential for reliability deficiencies if Diablo Canyon operations are not extended beyond 2025 and whether extending operations of Diablo Canyon until 2030 is prudent to ensure reliability in light of any potential for supply deficiency. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Utility adjusted the ARO to reflect extended operations of Diablo Canyon through 2030. However, the Utility’s ARO could be materially impacted if the Utility does not receive the required federal and state licenses, permits, and approvals.

During the period prior to extended operations, the bill authorizes a monthly performance-based disbursement equal to $7 for each MWh generated by Diablo Canyon. The performance-based disbursement will be paid from the loan proceeds authorized by SB 846 and is contingent upon the Utility’s ongoing pursuit of extension of the operating period and continued safe and reliable Diablo Canyon operations. The performance-based disbursement cannot be realized as shareholder profits or paid out as dividends.

During the period of extended operations and in lieu of the traditional rate-based return on investment, the bill provides for a fixed payment of $50 million, in 2022 dollars, for each of Diablo Canyon’s Unit 1 and Unit 2 for each year of extended operations to be recovered from customers of all CPUC-jurisdictional LSEs, which is potentially subject to adjustment downward in the event of extended unplanned outages. In addition, the bill authorizes a volumetric payment totaling $13, in 2022 dollars, for each MWh generated by Diablo Canyon during the period of extended operations, with the first half recovered from all CPUC-jurisdictional LSEs and the second half from customers in the Utility’s service area. The amount of the fixed and volumetric payments will be adjusted annually by the CPUC using CPUC-approved escalation methodologies and adjustment factors. The volumetric payment cannot be realized as shareholder profits or paid out as dividends, to the extent it is not needed for Diablo Canyon. The legislation includes language that limits use of the volumetric payment to investments in the system and for customers that address critical state priorities.

88

The CPUC has initiated a rulemaking proceeding in January 2023 to develop a new mechanism to recover costs from customers of all CPUC-jurisdictional LSEs for the continued operation of Diablo Canyon and to address other issues associated with continued operation, including cost responsibility if Diablo Canyon is unable to operate. The legislation also established a $300 million Liquidated Damages Balancing Account (“LDBA”) to be funded over time by all CPUC-jurisdictional customers. The LDBA provides a source for paying for replacement power costs, if incurred, due to unplanned outages at Diablo Canyon as a result of the Utility’s failure to meet the CPUC’s reasonable-manager standard.

The key remaining steps to continued operations include NRC license renewal and approval from California state agencies. If either is not received, the Utility would retire Unit 1 in 2024 and Unit 2 in 2025 as previously approved by the CPUC. On October 31, 2022, the Utility requested that the NRC resume its review of a license renewal application the Utility voluntarily withdrew and terminated in 2018 or else grant an exemption to permit operations to continue at Diablo Canyon after the expiration of each of its current operating licenses and until the NRC completes its review of the license renewal application. On January 24, 2023, the NRC staff declined to resume its review of the previously-withdrawn application and directed the Utility to submit a new application for license renewal, which the Utility expects to do by the end of 2023. The NRC staff has stated that it will provide a response to the Utility’s request for an exemption in March 2023. Consistent with SB 846, the CPUC, the CEC, California State Lands Commission, California Coastal Commission, and other state agencies will need to determine that extended operations represent an appropriate path to meet California’s reliability, affordability, and environmental goals.

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES

Assembly Bill 180

On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 180, which authorized the DWR to use up to $75 million to support contracts with the owners of electric generating facilities pending retirement, such as Diablo Canyon, to fund, reimburse or compensate the owner for any costs, expenses or financial commitments incurred to retain the future availability of such generating facilities pending further legislation.

Assembly Bill 205

On June 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed AB 205, which included authorization for additional incremental CAPP funding of $958 million for California IOUs. The Utility received approximately $200 million in November 2022 to reduce the amounts owed by customer accounts in arrears. The amount of funding was determined by the California Department of Community Services and Development, which is the agency responsible for administering the CAPP.

Senate Bill 846

On September 2, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 846, which supports the extension of operations at Diablo Canyon through no later than 2030, with the potential for an earlier retirement date. For more information, see “Extension of Diablo Canyon Operations” above.

Senate Bill 884

On September 30, 2022, the Governor of California signed SB 884, which authorizes and expedites OEIS and CPUC review of a 10-year undergrounding plan. Under SB 884, large electrical corporations may submit 10-year plans for undergrounding distribution infrastructure in Tier 2 or 3 HFTDs or rebuild areas to OEIS. The plan must include an evaluation of project costs, projected economic benefits over the life of the assets, and any cost-containment assumptions, including the economies of scale necessary to reduce wildfire risk and mitigation costs and establish a sustainable supply chain. OEIS will have up to nine months to review and approve or deny the plan, and then the CPUC will have up to nine months to review and approve or deny the plan, including its costs.

Inflation Reduction Act

On August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed the Inflation Reduction Act. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) on the adjusted financial statement income (“AFSI”) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period, effective January 1, 2023. The law also extends and modifies existing tax credits and creates new tax credits for renewable and clean energy sources. Many aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act, including the CAMT, remain uncertain and the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service have been granted broad authority to enact regulations implementing its provisions. Depending on the guidance issued, PG&E Corporation and the Utility’s federal income tax liability could increase substantially. PG&E Corporation and the Utility continue to evaluate the impact of the law and its potential implications.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Utility’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and permits relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of the Utility’s personnel and the public.  These laws and requirements relate to a broad range of the Utility’s activities, including the remediation of hazardous substances; the reporting and reduction of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions; the discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil; the reporting of safety and reliability measures for natural gas storage facilities; and the transportation, handling, storage, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Environmental Regulation” in Item 1. and “Environmental Remediation Contingencies” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

PG&E Corporation, mainly through its ownership of the Utility, and the Utility are exposed to risks associated with adverse changes in commodity prices, interest rates, and counterparty credit. The Utility actively manages market risk through risk management programs designed to support business objectives, discourage unauthorized risk-taking, reduce commodity cost volatility, and manage cash flows.  The Utility uses derivative instruments only for non-trading purposes (i.e., risk mitigation) and not for speculative purposes.

Commodity Price Risk

The Utility is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its electricity and natural gas procurement activities, including the procurement of natural gas and nuclear fuel necessary for electricity generation and natural gas procurement for core customers. The Utility’s risk management activities include the use of physical and financial instruments such as forward contracts, futures, swaps, options, and other instruments and agreements. As long as the Utility can conclude that it is probable that its reasonably incurred wholesale electricity procurement costs and natural gas costs are recoverable, fluctuations in electricity and natural gas prices do not affect earnings. Such fluctuations, however, may impact cash flows. The Utility’s natural gas transportation and storage costs for core customers are also fully recoverable through a ratemaking mechanism.

The Utility’s current authorized revenue requirement for natural gas transportation and storage service to non-core customers is not balancing account protected. The Utility recovers these costs in its GRC through fixed reservation charges and volumetric charges from long-term contracts, resulting in price and volumetric risk. The Utility uses value-at-risk to measure its shareholders’ exposure to these risks. The Utility’s value-at-risk was approximately $3 million and $5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of price risk management activities.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure interest rate risk by computing estimated changes in cash flows as a result of assumed changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, if interest rates changed by one percent for all PG&E Corporation and Utility variable rate long-term debt, short-term debt, and cash investments, the pre-tax impact on net income over the next 12 months would be $54 million and $76 million, respectively, based on net variable rate debt and other interest rate-sensitive instruments outstanding. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of interest rates.

90

Energy Procurement Credit Risk

The Utility conducts business with counterparties mainly in the energy industry to purchase electricity or gas and related services, including the CAISO market, other California IOUs, municipal utilities, energy trading companies, pipelines, financial institutions, electricity generation companies, and oil and natural gas production companies located in the United States and Canada. If a counterparty fails to perform on its contractual obligation to deliver electricity or gas and related services, then the Utility may find it necessary to procure electricity or gas at current market prices or seek alternate services, which may be higher than the contract prices.

The Utility manages credit risk associated with its counterparties by assigning credit limits based on evaluations of their financial conditions, net worth, credit ratings, and other credit criteria as deemed appropriate. Credit limits and credit quality are monitored periodically. The Utility executes many energy contracts under master commodity enabling agreements that may require security. Security may be in the form of cash or letters of credit. The Utility may accept other forms of performance assurance in the form of corporate guarantees of acceptable credit quality or other eligible securities (as deemed appropriate by the Utility). Security or performance assurance may be required from the Utility or counterparties when current net receivables or payables and exposure exceed contractually specified limits.

The following table summarizes the Utility’s energy procurement credit risk exposure to its counterparties:

----------------- -------------------------- --- ------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- - ---
 Exposure (1) (in millions) Number ofWholesaleCustomers orCounterparties>10% Net CreditExposure toWholesaleCustomers orCounterparties>10% (in millions)
December 31, 2022 $ 814 1 $ 162
December 31, 2021 $ 570 1 $ 63

(1) Exposure is the positive exposure maximum that equals mark-to-market value on physically and financially settled contracts, plus net receivables (payables) where netting is contractually allowed minus collateral posted by counterparties and held by the Utility plus collateral posted by the Utility and held by the counterparties. For purposes of this table, parental guarantees are not included as part of the calculation. Exposure amounts reported above do not include adjustments for time value or liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting policies described below are considered to be critical accounting estimates due, in part, to their complexity and because their application is relevant and material to the financial position and results of operations of PG&E Corporation and the Utility, and because these policies require the use of material judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. These accounting estimates and their key characteristics are outlined below.

Contributions to the Wildfire Fund

The Wildfire Fund is expected to be capitalized with (i) $10.5 billion of proceeds of bonds supported by a 15-year extension of the DWR charge to customers, (ii) $7.5 billion in initial contributions from California’s three large electric IOUs, and (iii) $300 million in annual contributions paid by California’s three large electric IOUs for a 10-year period. The contributions from the IOUs will be effectively borne by their respective shareholders, as they will not be permitted to recover these costs through rates. The costs of the initial and annual contributions are allocated among the IOUs pursuant to a “Wildfire Fund allocation metric” set forth in AB 1054 based on land area in the applicable IOU’s service area classified as HFTDs and adjusted to account for risk mitigation efforts. The Utility’s Wildfire Fund allocation metric is 64.2% (representing an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and annual contributions of approximately $193 million).

91

On the Emergence Date, PG&E Corporation and the Utility contributed, in accordance with AB 1054, an initial contribution of approximately $4.8 billion and first annual contribution of approximately $193 million to the Wildfire Fund to secure participation of the Utility therein. The other large electric IOUs made their initial contributions to the Wildfire Fund in September 2019. On December 30, 2021 and 2022, the Utility made its third and fourth annual contributions of $193 million each to the Wildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have six remaining annual contributions of $193 million (based on the current Wildfire Fund allocation metric). PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for contributions to the Wildfire Fund by capitalizing an asset, amortizing to periods ratably based on an estimated period of coverage, and incrementally adjusting for accelerated amortization as the level of coverage declines, as further described below.

As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $193 million in Other current liabilities, $935 million in Other non-current liabilities, $460 million in current assets - Wildfire Fund asset, and $4.8 billion in non-current assets - Wildfire Fund asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Utility recorded amortization and accretion expense of $477 million and $517 million, respectively. The amortization of the asset, accretion of the liability, and acceleration of the amortization of the asset is reflected in Wildfire Fund expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Expected contributions recorded in Wildfire Fund asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are discounted to the present value using the 10-year U.S. treasury rate at the date PG&E Corporation and the Utility satisfied all the eligibility requirements to participate in the Wildfire Fund. A useful life of 15 years is being used to amortize the Wildfire Fund asset.

AB 1054 did not specify a period of coverage; therefore, this accounting treatment is subject to significant accounting judgments and estimates. In estimating the period of coverage, PG&E Corporation and the Utility use a Monte Carlo simulation that began with 12 years of historical, publicly available fire-loss data from wildfires caused by electrical equipment, and subsequently plan to add an additional year of data each following year. The period of historic fire-loss data and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts by the California electric utility companies are significant assumptions used to estimate the useful life. These assumptions along with the other assumptions below create a high degree of uncertainty related to the estimated useful life of the Wildfire Fund. The simulation creates annual distributions of potential losses due to fires that could be attributed to the participating electric utilities. Initial use of five years of historical data, with average annual statewide claims or settlements of approximately $6.5 billion versus 12 years of historical data, with average annual statewide claims or settlements of approximately $2.9 billion, would have resulted in a six year amortization period. As of December 31, 2022, a 5% change to the assumption around current and future mitigation effort effectiveness would increase the amortization period by five years assuming greater effectiveness and would decrease the amortization period by four years assuming less effectiveness.

Other assumptions used to estimate the useful life include the estimated cost of wildfires caused by participating electric utilities, the amount at which wildfire claims would be settled, the likely adjudication of the CPUC in cases of electric utility-caused wildfires and determination of any amounts required to be reimbursed to the Wildfire Fund, the impacts of climate change, the level of future insurance coverage held by the electric utilities, the FERC-allocable portion of loss recovery, and the future transmission and distribution equity rate base growth of participating electric utilities. Significant changes in any of these estimates could materially impact the amortization period.

PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate all assumptions quarterly and upon claims being made from the Wildfire Fund for catastrophic wildfires, and the expected life of the Wildfire Fund will be adjusted as required. The Wildfire Fund is available to other participating utilities in California and the amount of claims that a participating utility incurs is not limited to their individual contribution amounts. PG&E Corporation and the Utility assess the Wildfire Fund asset for acceleration of the amortization of the asset in the event that a participating utility’s electrical equipment is found to be the substantial cause of a catastrophic wildfire. Timing of any such acceleration of the amortization of the asset could lag as the emergence of sufficient cause and claims information can take many quarters and could be limited to public disclosure of the participating electric utility, if ignition were to occur outside the Utility’s service area. There were fires in the Utility’s and other participating utilities’ services territories since July 12, 2019, including fires for which the cause is unknown, which may in the future be determined to be covered by the Wildfire Fund. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $175 million in Other noncurrent assets for Wildfire Fund receivables related to the 2021 Dixie fire. PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded $6 million and $43 million of accelerated amortization, reflected in Wildfire Fund expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

For more information, see “Contributions to the Wildfire Fund Established Pursuant to AB 1054” in Note 3 and “Wildfire Fund under AB 1054” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Loss Contingencies

As discussed below, PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recorded material accruals for various wildfire-related, enforcement and legal matters, and environmental remediation liabilities. PG&E Corporation and the Utility have also recorded insurance receivables for third-party claims.

Wildfire-Related Liabilities

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to potential liabilities related to wildfires.  PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a wildfire-related liability when they determine that a loss is probable and they can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The provision is based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.

Potential liabilities related to wildfires depend on various factors, including negotiations and settlements or the cause of each fire, contributing causes of the fires (including alternative potential origins, weather and climate related issues), the number, size and type of structures damaged or destroyed, the contents of such structures and other personal property damage, the number and types of trees damaged or destroyed, attorneys’ fees for claimants, the nature and extent of any personal injuries, including the loss of lives, the extent to which future claims arise, the amount of fire suppression and clean-up costs, other damages the Utility may be responsible for if found negligent, and the amount of any penalties or fines that may be imposed by governmental entities. There are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability, including the total scope and nature of claims that may be asserted against PG&E Corporation or the Utility. For example, the Utility’s wildfire-related accruals have changed in the past as new facts and information became available to the Utility, including the availability of new evidence and additional information about the scope and nature of damages.

The process for estimating wildfire-related liabilities requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors, including the factors identified above and estimates based on currently available information and prior experience with wildfires.  See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Enforcement and Litigation Matters

PG&E Corporation and the Utility are subject to various laws and regulations and, in the normal course of business, are named as parties in a number of claims and lawsuits. In addition, penalties may be incurred for failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a provision for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. PG&E Corporation and the Utility evaluate the range of reasonably estimated losses and record a provision based on the lower end of the range, unless an amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Loss contingencies are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, such as negotiations, discovery, settlements and payments, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. PG&E Corporation’s and the Utility’s provision for loss and expense excludes anticipated legal costs, which are expensed as incurred. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. See Note 15 and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Loss Recoveries

PG&E Corporation and the Utility have recovery mechanisms available for wildfire liabilities including from insurance, through rates, and from the Wildfire Fund. The Utility has liability insurance from various insurers, which provides coverage for third-party claims. PG&E Corporation and the Utility record a receivable for a recovery when it is deemed probable that recovery of a recorded loss will occur and they can reasonably estimate the amount or its range.  The assessment of whether recovery is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the recovery or a range of recoveries is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  Loss recoveries are reviewed quarterly, and estimates are adjusted to reflect the impact of all known information, including contractual liability insurance policy coverage, advice of legal counsel, past experience with similar events, conversations with the Wildfire Fund administrators, the CPUC and FERC, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. See “Loss Recoveries” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

93

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

The Utility is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal and California environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require the Utility to pay for environmental remediation at sites where it has been, or may be, a potentially responsible party. Such contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous substances at various potential sites, including former MGP sites, power plant sites, gas compressor stations, and sites used by the Utility for the storage, recycling, or disposal of potentially hazardous materials, even if the Utility did not deposit those substances on the site.

The Utility generally commences the environmental remediation assessment process upon notification from federal or state agencies, or other parties, of a potential site requiring remedial action. (In some instances, the Utility may initiate action to determine its remediation liability for sites that it no longer owns in cooperation with regulatory agencies. For example, the Utility has a program related to certain former MGP sites.) Based on such notification, the Utility completes an assessment of the potential site and evaluates whether it is probable that a remediation liability has been incurred. The Utility records an environmental remediation liability when site assessments indicate remediation is probable and it can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of possible losses. Given the complexities of the legal and regulatory environment and the inherent uncertainties involved in the early stages of a remediation project, the process for estimating remediation liabilities is subjective and requires significant judgment. Key factors evaluated in developing cost estimates include the extent and types of hazardous substances at a potential site, the range of technologies that can be used for remediation, the determination of the Utility’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

When possible, the Utility estimates costs using site-specific information, but also considers historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites depending on the level of information available. Estimated costs are composed of the direct costs of the remediation effort and the costs of compensation for employees who are expected to devote a significant amount of time directly to the remediation effort. These estimated costs include remedial site investigations, remediation actions, operations and maintenance activities, post remediation monitoring, and the costs of technologies that are expected to be approved to remediate the site. Remediation efforts for a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, thereby possibly affecting the cost of the remediation effort.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Utility’s accruals for undiscounted gross environmental liabilities were $1.3 billion each. The Utility’s undiscounted future costs could increase to as much as $2.3 billion if the extent of contamination or necessary remediation is greater than anticipated or if the other potentially responsible parties are not financially able to contribute to these costs and could increase further if the Utility chooses to remediate beyond regulatory requirements. Although the Utility has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, estimated costs may vary significantly from actual costs, and the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized.

Regulatory Accounting

As a regulated entity, the Utility records regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are deemed probable of recovery from, or refund to, customers. Despite the ongoing losses related to wildfires (see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), there is no actual or anticipated change in the cost-of-service regulation of the Utility’s operations. Therefore, the Utility continues to apply the accounting ASC 980, Regulated Operations. These amounts would otherwise be recorded to expense or income under GAAP. Refer to “Regulation and Regulated Operations” in Note 3 as well as Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. As of December 31, 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility reported regulatory assets (including current regulatory balancing accounts receivable) of $20.0 billion and regulatory liabilities (including current regulatory balancing accounts payable) of $20.4 billion.

Determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders, and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals. For some of the Utility’s regulatory assets, including utility retained generation, the Utility has determined that the costs are recoverable based on specific approval from the CPUC. The Utility also records a regulatory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery of incurred costs is probable, such as the regulatory assets for pension benefits; deferred income tax; price risk management; and unamortized loss, net of gain, on reacquired debt. If the Utility determined that it is no longer probable that regulatory assets would be recovered or reflected in future rates, or if the Utility ceased to be subject to rate regulation, the regulatory assets would be charged against income in the period in which that determination was made. If regulatory accounting did not apply, the Utility’s future financial results could become more volatile as compared to historical financial results due to the differences in the timing of expense or revenue recognition.

94

A portion of the Utility’s regulatory asset balances relate to items which could not be anticipated by the Utility during CPUC GRC rate requests resulting from catastrophic events, changes in regulation, or extraordinary changes in operating practices. The Utility may seek authority to track incremental costs in a memorandum account, and the CPUC may authorize recovery of costs tracked in memorandum accounts if the costs are deemed incremental and prudently incurred. These accounts, which include the CEMA, WEMA, FHPMA, FRMMA, WMPMA, VMBA, WMBA, and RTBA among others, allow the Utility to track the costs associated with work related to disaster and wildfire response, and other wildfire prevention-related costs. In addition, the CPPMA and RUBA accounts track costs incurred to implement the CPUC’s Emergency Authorization and Order Directing Utilities to Implement Emergency Customer Protections to Support California Customers During the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Utility generally believes such costs are recoverable, rate recovery requires CPUC authorization in separate proceedings or through a GRC. For more information, see “Regulatory Matters - Application for Recovery of Costs Recorded in the Wildfire Expense Memorandum Account” and “Regulatory Matters - Catastrophic Event Memorandum Accounts and Applications” above.

Additionally, SB 901 provides a mechanism for the CPUC to potentially allow recovery in future rates, through a securitization mechanism, of wildfire-related costs found to be just and reasonable by the CPUC and, only for the 2017 Northern California wildfires, any amounts in excess of the CHT. The Utility must evaluate the likelihood of recovery in future rates each period. In 2022, PG&E Corporation and the Utility recorded a regulatory asset associated with SB 901. As of December 31, 2022, the SB 901 regulatory asset was approximately $5.4 billion.

In addition, regulatory accounting standards require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that capital expenditures will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and if a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. Such assessments require significant judgment by management regarding probability of recovery, as described above, and the ultimate cost of construction of capital assets. The Utility records a loss to the extent capital costs are expected to exceed the amount to be recovered.  The Utility’s capital forecasts involve a series of complex judgments regarding detailed project plans, estimates included in third-party contracts, historical cost experience for similar projects, permitting requirements, environmental compliance standards, and a variety of other factors.

Asset Retirement Obligations

PG&E Corporation and the Utility account for an ARO at fair value in the period during which the legal obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value and its settlement date can be made. At the time of recording an ARO, the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The Utility recognizes a regulatory asset or liability for the timing differences between the recognition of expenses and costs recovered through the ratemaking process. See Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

To estimate its liability, the Utility uses a discounted cash flow model based upon significant estimates and assumptions about future decommissioning costs, inflation rates, and the estimated date of decommissioning. The estimated future cash flows are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate that reflects the risk associated with the decommissioning obligation.

At December 31, 2022, the Utility’s recorded ARO for the estimated cost of retiring these long-lived assets was approximately $5.9 billion. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

PG&E Corporation and the Utility sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for eligible employees as well as contributory postretirement health care and medical plans for eligible retirees and their eligible dependents, and non-contributory postretirement life insurance plans for eligible employees and retirees. Adjustments to the pension and other benefit obligation are based on the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results. These amounts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized into income on a gradual basis. The differences between pension benefit expense recognized in accordance with GAAP, and amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities as amounts are probable of recovery through rates. To the extent the other benefits are in an overfunded position, the Utility records a regulatory liability. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

95

The pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are calculated using actuarial models as of the December 31 measurement date. The significant actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and other benefit obligations include the discount rate, the average rate of future compensation increases, the health care cost trend rate, and the expected return on plan assets. PG&E Corporation and the Utility review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary. While PG&E Corporation and the Utility believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience, plan changes or amendments, or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the recorded pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future plan expenses. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

In establishing health care cost assumptions, PG&E Corporation and the Utility consider recent cost trends and projections from industry experts. This evaluation suggests that current rates of inflation are expected to continue in the near term. In recognition of continued high inflation in health care costs and given the design of PG&E Corporation’s plans, the assumed health care cost trend rate for 2023 was 6.5%, gradually decreasing to the ultimate trend rate of approximately 4.5% in 2031 and beyond.

Expected rates of return on plan assets were developed by estimating future stock and bond returns and then applying these returns to the target asset allocations of the employee benefit plan trusts, resulting in a weighted average rate of return on plan assets. Returns on fixed-income debt investments were projected based on real maturity and credit spreads added to a long-term inflation rate. Returns on equity investments were projected based on estimates of dividend yield and real earnings growth added to a long-term inflation rate. For the Utility’s defined benefit pension plan, the assumed return of 6.1% compares to a ten-year actual return of 5.8%.

The rate used to discount pension benefits and other benefits was based on a yield curve developed from market data of approximately 848 Aa-grade non-callable bonds at December 31, 2022. This yield curve has discount rates that vary based on the duration of the obligations. The estimated future cash flows for the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations were matched to the corresponding rates on the yield curve to derive a weighted average discount rate.

The following reflects the sensitivity of pension costs and projected benefit obligation to changes in certain actuarial assumptions:

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...
