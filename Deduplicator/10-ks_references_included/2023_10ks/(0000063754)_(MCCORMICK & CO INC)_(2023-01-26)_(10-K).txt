ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Overview
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand McCormick & Company, Incorporated, our operations and our present business environment from the perspective of management. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. We use certain non-GAAP information — more fully described below under the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures — that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. The dollar and share information in the charts and tables in MD&A are in millions, except per share data.
McCormick is a global leader in flavor. We manufacture, market and distribute spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food and beverage industry–retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We manage our business in two operating segments, consumer and flavor solutions, as described in Item 1 of this report.

Our long-term annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4% to 6%, increase adjusted operating income 7% to 9% and increase adjusted earnings per share 9% to 11%. Our actual results for a year can vary from our long-term growth objectives.
Recent Events
Recent events impacting our business include global economic conditions, inflationary cost environment, disruption in our supply chain, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, each of which are further discussed below. Each of these factors impacted our fiscal 2022 operating results and we expect each will impact our fiscal 2023 performance. We expect elevated levels of cost inflation to persist throughout 2023, although at lower levels than experienced in 2022. We anticipate in 2023 that these headwinds will be partially mitigated by pricing actions in response to inflation, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives. The effects of inflation have also resulted in central banks raising short-term interest rates and, as a result, we expect that our interest expense will increase in 2023. While we expect the impacts of COVID-19 on our business to moderate, there still remains uncertainty around the pandemic, its effect on labor or other macroeconomic factors, its severity and duration, the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and actions taken by third parties or by government authorities in response, including restrictions, laws or regulations, or other responses. Also, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the sanctions imposed in response to this conflict, have increased global economic and political uncertainty.
While the impact of these factors remains uncertain, we continue to evaluate the extent to which they may impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. These and other uncertainties could result in changes to our current expectations. The potential effects of these recent events also could impact us in a number of other ways including, but not limited to, variations in the level of our sales, profitability, cash flows, fluctuations in foreign currency markets, the availability of future borrowings, the cost of borrowings, valuation of our pension assets and obligations, credit risks of our customers and counterparties, laws and regulations affecting our business, and potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Global Economic Conditions and Inflationary Cost Environment – During fiscal 2021 and 2022, we experienced inflationary cost increases in our commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. We expect that these inflationary cost increases will continue but we expect they will be partially mitigated by our planned 2023 pricing actions, our organization and streamlining actions, including our Global Operating Effectiveness Program, and by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program-led cost savings. There has been, and we expect there could continue to be, a difference between the timing of when the impact of cost inflation occurs and when these pricing and other actions impact our results of operations. Additionally, in some instances the pricing actions we take have been impacted by price elasticity which unfavorably impacts our sales volume and mix.
Our interest expense is impacted by the overall global economic and interest rate environment. The inflationary environment has also resulted in central banks raising short-term interest rates. On November 30, 2022, we had total outstanding variable rate debt of approximately $1,295 million. Our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. As of November 30, 2022, we had total outstanding fixed to variable interest rate swaps of $600 million notional. We expect that our interest expense will increase in 2023 as a result of the higher interest rate environment.
Supply Chain Disruption – Over the past several years, as we have responded to demand volatility, COVID-19 and overall macroeconomic conditions, we have experienced pressures in our supply chain, including inefficiencies associated with demand volatility. These pressures are in addition to the inflationary cost environment previously noted and have included strained availability of raw materials and transportation capacity, expedited shipping costs, costs incurred in response to COVID-19, incremental warehouse costs to store increased inventory associated with maintaining additional safety stock, additional use of co-manufacturers, and labor shortages and absenteeism, in part, associated with COVID-19. The severity of those supply chain pressures varied over 2022, 2021 and 2020.
In response to the general economic conditions, inflationary cost environment, and the supply chain pressures and related inefficiencies, we expect to eliminate approximately $125 million of costs during 2023 and 2024, including $100 million of supply chain costs and $25 million of costs across the remainder of the organization under our Global Operating Effectiveness program. The supply chain actions we are taking, and will continue to evaluate, include returning our manufacturing facilities to a more normal shift schedule, reducing headcount, and stabilizing turnover rates to reduce our labor costs; increasing our manufacturing capacity and automation to respond to the evaluated demand as well as reduce the use of co-manufacturers; and executing and evaluating initiatives to reduce the safety stock levels of our inventory that were put in place to protect against supply disruptions. The

22

elimination of other costs across the organization will include a voluntary retirement program and other streamlining initiatives.
COVID-19 – The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our operating results. The extent and nature of government actions, customer and end-consumer demand and the impact on our supply chain varied during the years ended November 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 based upon the then-current extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic within the countries, localities and markets where we do business.
We continue to actively monitor the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business. However, uncertainty remains with the pandemic and such impact will ultimately depend on the length and severity of the pandemic, including new strains and variants of the virus; infection rates in the markets where we do business; the federal, state, and local government actions taken in response; vaccine effectiveness; and the macroeconomic environment. The effects of COVID-19 on consumer behavior have impacted the relative balance of at-home versus away-from-home food consumption and demand. While we continue to see strong levels of at-home consumption compared to pre-pandemic levels, the favorable impact of increased at-home meal preparation was less significant in the year ended November 30, 2022 as compared to 2021. This change in consumer behavior was due in part to a decrease in the prevalence and scale of restrictive measures in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the 2022 period as compared to 2021. Conversely, we continue to see improvements in away-from-home demand associated with the COVID-19 recovery. During the year ended November 30, 2022, our flavor solutions segment sales improved as away-from-home consumption increased as compared to 2021, in part, due to the continued easing of restrictive COVID-19 mitigation measures in many jurisdictions compared to those that were in place during 2021. However, during 2022 the impact of restrictive measures related to COVID-19 resurgences in China negatively impacted consumer behavior in China as compared to 2021.
For comparative purposes, the following provides a summary of our compounded annual growth rate in net sales as reported and on a constant currency basis for the year ended 2022 as compared to 2019:

------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------- -------------------------------------------- - --- -
 For the year ended November 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended November 30, 2019
 Percentage change as reported Impact of foreign currency exchange Percentage change on constant currency basis
Net sales:
Consumer segment 4.7 % (0.2) % 4.9 %
Flavor Solutions segment 7.7 % (0.4) % 8.1 %
Total net sales 5.9 % (0.3) % 6.2 %

The percentage change in our compounded annual growth rate in reported net sales and the percentage change on a constant currency basis were favorably impacted by the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA and unfavorably impacted by the sale of Kitchen Basics. In aggregate on a net basis, these factors contributed 0.6%, 2.1% and 1.3% to the consumer segment, flavor solutions segment and total net sales growth rates, respectively, in the preceding table, on both a reported and constant currency basis.
Conflict Between Russia and Ukraine – The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the sanctions imposed in response to this conflict, have increased global economic and political uncertainty. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, or the sanctions imposed to date, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, energy and fuel prices, currency exchange rates and financial markets. We announced on March 11, 2022, that we were suspending our business operations in Russia. In May 2022, we made the decision to exit our consumer business in Russia. Our operations in Ukraine were also temporarily paused in order to focus on the safety of our employees, but we have resumed, where appropriate, a reduced level of operating activities. While neither our operations in Russia nor Ukraine constitute a material portion of our business, a significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the conflict's current scope could disrupt our supply chain, broaden inflationary costs, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Sales Growth – Over time, we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from: 1) our base business – driven by brand marketing support, category management, and differentiated customer engagement; 2) new products; and 3) acquisitions.
Base Business – We expect to drive sales growth by optimizing our brand marketing investment through improved speed, quality and effectiveness. We measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified

23

digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support. Through digital marketing, we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes, provide cooking advice and help them discover new products.
New Products – For our consumer segment, we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition, including private label. We are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion, from gourmet, premium items to convenient and value-priced flavors.
For flavor solutions customers, we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products, as well as flavors for new menu items. We have a strong pipeline of flavor solutions products aligned with our customers’ new product launch plans, many of which include clean-label, organic, natural, and “better-for-you” innovation. With over 20 product innovation centers around the world, we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our flavor solutions customers with products that appeal to local consumers.
Acquisitions – Acquisitions are expected to approximate one-third of our sales growth over time. Since the beginning of 2017, we have completed four acquisitions, which are driving sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. We focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health. Geographically, our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets. Information with respect to our two most recent acquisitions is provided below:
•On December 30, 2020, we acquired FONA International, LLC and certain of its affiliates (FONA), a privately owned company, for approximately $708 million, net of cash acquired. We financed this fiscal 2021 acquisition with cash and short-term borrowings. FONA is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food, beverage and nutritional markets which expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories, as well as extends our technology platform, strengthens our capabilities, and accelerates the strategic migration of our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products.
•On November 30, 2020, we acquired the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce® (Cholula) from L Catterton for approximately $801 million, net of cash acquired. Cholula is a strong addition to our global branded flavor portfolio, which broadens our offerings in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic Mexican flavor hot sauce in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments.
Cost Savings and Business Transformation – We are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our CCI program, an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization, as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements that includes our expected elimination of approximately $125 million of costs in 2023 and 2024 as part of our Global Operating Effectiveness program, including $100 million of supply costs and $25 million of costs across the remainder of the organization. Our CCI program funds brand marketing support, product innovation and other growth initiatives. We expect our CCI program, Global Operating Effectiveness program, and organization and streamlining actions to deliver savings of approximately $75 million in 2023.
We are making investments to build the McCormick of the future, including in our Global Enablement (GE) organization to transform McCormick through globally aligned, innovative services to enable growth. As technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment, information sharing and scalability, we are also making investments in our information systems. We continue to progress our global enterprise resource planning (ERP) replacement program which will enable us to accelerate the transformation of our ways of working and provide a scalable platform for growth.
We expect that, in total over the course of the ERP replacement program for our major markets, we will invest approximately $400 million, including expenses related to the go-live activities in our operations, to enable the anticipated completion of the roll out of our new information technology platform to those markets in 2025. Of that projected $400 million, we expect capitalized software to account for approximately 50% and program expenses to account for approximately 50%. Of the approximately $200 million of operating expenses included in our projected total spending, approximately $122 million has been recognized through November 30, 2022. Of the approximately $200 million of capitalized software included in our projected total spending, approximately $137 million has been recognized through November 30, 2022.
Cash Flow – Net cash provided by operating activities was $651.5 million, $828.3 million and $1,041.3 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In 2022, we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment,

24

capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends, with annual increases in each of the past 37 years, and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. In 2022, the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was $435.5 million.
Operating Results – On a long-term basis, we expect a combination of acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayments, and the resulting impact on interest expense, to add about 2% to earnings per share growth.
In 2022, we achieved further growth of our business with net sales rising 0.5% over the 2021 level due to the following factors:
•Pricing actions, including those taken in response to the inflationary cost environment, contributed 7.7% of the increase in net sales.
•Volume and product mix unfavorably impacted our net sales growth by 4.5%, exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures. Our consumer segment experienced unfavorable volume and product mix of 9.3% which included the unfavorable impact of price elasticity as well as the impact of restrictive measures related to COVID-19 resurgences in China, the exit of our consumer operations in Russia, and the exit of our rice product line in India which collectively contributed approximately 1.5% to that decline. Increased volume and product mix of 3.5% in our flavor solutions segment was principally driven by the continued strength of sales to packaged food companies and the continued recovery in away-from-home demand.
•Acquisitions contributed 0.2% of the increase in net sales. Divestitures negatively impacted our net sales increase by 0.4%.
•Net sales growth was negatively impacted by fluctuations in currency rates that decreased sales growth by 2.5%. Excluding this impact, we grew sales by 3.0% over the prior year on a constant currency basis.
Operating income was $863.6 million in 2022 and $1,015.1 million in 2021. We recorded $51.6 million and $51.1 million of special charges in 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to organization and streamlining actions. Special charges in 2021 included $4.7 million in cost of goods sold related the exit of a low margin business. In 2022 and 2021, we also recorded $2.2 million and $35.3 million of transaction and integration expenses, respectively, related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA that reduced operating income. In 2022, compared to the year-ago period, the unfavorable impact of increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs and higher conversion costs more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales, which included the impact of pricing actions taken in response to the inflationary environment, $112 million of cost savings from our CCI program, including organization and streamlining actions, and lower incentive-based compensation. Excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, adjusted operating income was $917.4 million in 2022, a decrease of 16.7%, compared to $1,101.5 million in the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income declined 15.5%. For further details and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to reported amounts, see the subsequent discussion under the heading "Non-GAAP Financial Measures".
Diluted earnings per share was $2.52 in 2022 and $2.80 in 2021. The year-on-year decrease in earnings per share was primarily driven by lower operating income that was partially offset by the favorable effect of a lower level of special charges and transaction and integration expenses in 2022 as compared to 2021. Special charges and transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by $0.15 and $0.30 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. A gain on our sale of a business increased earnings per share by $0.14 in 2022. A gain on our sale of an unconsolidated operation increased earnings per share by $0.05 in 2021. Excluding the effects of special charges, transaction and integration expenses, the gain realized from the sale of a business, and the gain realized from the sale of an unconsolidated operation, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.53 in 2022 and $3.05 in 2021, or a decrease of 17.0%.

25

2023 Outlook
In 2023, we expect to grow net sales over the 2022 level by 5% to 7%, which includes a minimal impact of foreign currency rates. We anticipate that the 2023 sales growth will be driven by pricing actions, including the completion of those executed in 2022 combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023. We expect volume and product mix to be impacted by pricing elasticities, although, consistent with 2022, at a lower level than we have experienced historically. We anticipate that our volume and product mix will also be impacted by the combined impact of lapping last year’s COVID-related disruptions in China, the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics brand in the third quarter of last year, the exit of our consumer business in Russia during the second quarter of last year, and the pruning of low margin businesses.
We expect our 2023 gross profit margin to range from 25 basis points to 75 basis points higher than our gross profit margin of 35.8% in 2022. The projected 2023 increase in gross profit margin is principally due to the net effect of (i) the favorable impact of pricing actions in response to increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs, (ii) the favorable impact of anticipated Global Operating Effectiveness Program and CCI cost savings, and (iii) a low to mid-teen percentage impact of inflation in 2023 compared to 2022. As we recover the cost inflation of our pricing that has lagged in the past two years, we expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing actions and our expected cost savings in 2023.
In 2023, we expect an increase in operating income of 10% to 12%, which includes a minimal impact from foreign currency rates, over the 2022 level. The projected 2023 change in operating income includes the effects of cost savings from our Global Operating Effectiveness Program and lapping the COVID-19 restrictive measures in China during 2022, which we anticipate will be partially offset by increased employee incentive compensation and the impact of our Kitchen Basics divestiture. Our CCI-led cost savings target in 2023 is approximately $85 million. We expect that the absence of $2.2 million of integration expenses related to the FONA acquisition in 2022 to favorably impact operating income in 2023. We also expect approximately $50 million of special charges in 2023 that relate to previously announced organization and streamlining actions; in 2022, special charges were $51.6 million. Excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses, we expect 2023’s adjusted operating income to increase by 9% to 11%, which includes a minimal impact from foreign currency rates.
We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 to $210 million in 2023, with the increase over 2022 being driven by the higher interest-rate environment which will impact our variable rate debt. In 2023, we will also lap the favorable effects associated with the termination of interest rate contracts. These contracts were entered into to manage the interest rate risk associated with our then anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt, which favorably impacted other income, net in 2022.
Our underlying effective tax rate is projected to be higher in 2023 than in 2022. We estimate that our 2023 effective tax rate, including the net favorable impact of anticipated discrete tax items, will be 22% as compared to 20.7% in 2022. Excluding projected taxes associated with special charges, we estimate that our adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 22% in 2023, as compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.9% in 2022.
Diluted earnings per share was $2.52 in 2022. Diluted earnings per share for 2023 is projected to range from $2.42 to $2.47. Excluding the per share impact of (i) special charges of $51.6; (ii) integration expenses of $2.2 million; and (iii) the gain realized upon our sale of Kitchen Basics of $49.6 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.53 in 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding an estimated per share impact from special charges of $0.14, is projected to range from $2.56 to $2.61 in 2023. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow by 1% to 3% over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.53 in 2022, including a minimal impact from foreign currency rates.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2022 COMPARED TO 2021

-------------------------------------------------------------- ----- ------- ---- - -------
 2022 2021
Net sales $ 6,350.5 $ 6,317.9
Percent growth 0.5 % 12.8 %
Components of percent growth in net sales–increase (decrease):
Volume and product mix (4.5) % 5.5 %
Pricing actions 7.7 % 0.8 %
Acquisitions 0.2 % 4.1 %
Divestiture (0.4) % — %
Foreign exchange (2.5) % 2.4 %

Sales for 2022 increased by 0.5% from 2021 and by 3.0% on a constant currency basis (that is, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption, Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Unfavorable volume and product mix decreased sales by 4.5% with growth in our flavor solutions segment being more than offset by a decline in our consumer segment. The impact of restrictive measures related to COVID-19 resurgences in China, the exit of our consumer operations in Russia, and the exit of our rice product line in India, contributed approximately 1.0% to that decline as compared to 2021. In addition, pricing actions, taken in response to the inflationary cost environment, added 7.7% to sales, as compared to the prior year. Acquisitions and a divestiture added to and decreased sales by 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively, both as compared to the prior year. Sales were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency rates that decreased sales by 2.5% in 2022 as compared to the prior year and are excluded from our measure of sales growth of 3.0% on a constant currency basis.

------------------- ---- ------- ---- - -------
 2022 2021
Gross profit $ 2,274.5 $ 2,494.6
Gross profit margin 35.8 % 39.5 %

In 2022, gross profit decreased by $220.1 million, or 8.8%, from the comparable period in 2021. Our gross profit margin for 2022 was 35.8%, a decrease of 370 basis points from 39.5% in 2021. The decline was driven by the margin dilutive impact of pricing actions taken in response to the inflationary cost environment of approximately 240 basis points, increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs, higher conversion costs and a less favorable product mix both within and between our segments, each as compared to 2021. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by cost savings led by our CCI program. In addition, our gross profit for 2021 was burdened by (i) $6.3 million of transaction expense, representing the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the acquired inventories of Cholula and FONA upon our sale of those acquired inventories in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and (ii) a non-cash special charge of $4.7 million associated with the exit of a low margin business in our Asia/Pacific region. Excluding those transaction and integration expenses and special charges, adjusted gross profit margin declined 390 basis points to 35.8% in 2022 from 39.7% in 2021.

----------------------------------------- ---- ------- ---- - -------
 2022 2021
Selling, general & administrative expense $ 1,357.1 $ 1,404.1
Percent of net sales 21.4 % 22.3 %

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $47.0 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. That decrease in SG&A expense was primarily a result of lower performance-based employee incentive expenses and variable selling costs, both as compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by (i) higher distribution costs; (ii) unfavorable investment results associated with non-qualified retirement plan assets; and (iii) higher investment associated with the implementation of our global enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform. SG&A as a percent of net sales for 2022 decreased by 90 basis points from the prior year level, due primarily to the net impact of the previously mentioned factors.

---------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- - ----

We regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time, those changes are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/ structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our Management Committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements.
During 2022, we recorded $51.6 million of special charges, consisting principally of (i) $23.3 million associated with the exit of our consumer business in Russia, (ii) $21.5 million associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in EMEA, and (iii) streamlining actions of $8.0 million in the Americas region, $7.1 million in the EMEA region, and (iv) $5.6 million associated with a U.S. voluntary retirement program. As more fully described in note 3 of our notes of consolidated financial statements, these charges were partially offset by a $13.6 million gain on the sale of our Kohinoor brand that was associated with the rice product line in India that we exited in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, as well as a reversal of $2.2 million of estimated costs associated with that rice product line exit upon settlement of a supply agreement related to that product line.
During 2021, we recorded $51.1 million of special charges, consisting principally of (i) $19.5 million associated with our exit of our rice product line in India (ii) $6.2 million associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in EMEA, (iii) streamlining actions of $10.3 million in the Americas region and $4.8 million in the EMEA region, and (iv) a non-cash asset impairment charge of $6.0 million associated with an administrative site that was sold in conjunction with our decision to employ a hybrid work environment.
Details with respect to the composition of special charges are including the accompanying notes to our financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.

--------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- - ----
 2022 2021
Transaction expenses included in cost of goods sold $ — $ 6.3
Other transaction and integration expenses 2.2 29.0
Total transaction and integration expenses $ 2.2 $ 35.3

During 2022, we recorded $2.2 million of integration expenses related to our acquisition of FONA. During 2021, we recorded transaction and integration expenses of $35.3 million related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. These costs consisted of (i) $6.3 million of amortization of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment of inventories that is included in Cost of goods sold, (ii) $13.8 million of other transaction expenses primarily related to outside advisory, service and consulting costs, and (iii) $15.2 million of integration expenses.

-------------------- ---- ----- ---- - -------
 2022 2021
Operating income $ 863.6 $ 1,015.1
Percent of net sales 13.6 % 16.1 %

Operating income decreased by $151.5 million, or 14.9%, from $1,015.1 million in 2021 to $863.6 million in 2022. Special charges and transaction and integration expenses decreased by $32.6 million in 2022, as compared to 2021, and positively impacted operating income. Operating income as a percentage of net sales declined by 250 basis points in 2022, to 13.6% in 2022 from 16.1% in 2021 as a result of the factors previously described. Excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described, adjusted operating income was $917.4 million in 2022 as compared to $1,101.5 million in 2021, a decrease of $184.1 million or 16.7% from the 2021 level. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales declined by 300 basis points in 2022, to 14.4% in 2022 from 17.4% in 2021.

----------------- ---- ----- ---- - -----
 2022 2021
Interest expense $ 149.1 $ 136.6
Other income, net 98.3 17.3

Interest expense was $12.5 million higher in 2022 as compared to the prior year as an increase in interest rates during the latter part of 2022 was partially offset by a decrease in average total borrowings. Other income, net for 2022 increased by $81.0 million, including the impact of a $49.6 million gain on the sale of our Kitchen Basics business and $18.7 million associated with the settlement of treasury lock arrangements, both of which are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying financial statements. The remaining increase was principally driven by an increase in interest income, as compared to the prior year.

 2022 2021
Income from consolidated operations before income taxes $ 812.8 $ 895.8
Income tax expense 168.6 192.7
Effective tax rate 20.7 % 21.5 %

The provision for income taxes is based on the estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period. We record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of U.S. GAAP. Examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income include, but are not limited to, excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years, including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations, provision-to-return adjustments, the settlement of tax audits, changes in enacted tax rates, changes in the assessment of deferred tax valuation allowances, acquisition related deferred tax adjustments, and the tax effects of certain intra-entity asset transfers (other than inventory).
The effective tax rate was 20.7% in 2022 as compared to 21.5% in 2021. The decrease in our effective tax rate was principally attributable to the effects of the lower level of income before income taxes and the higher level of net discrete tax benefits in 2022 as compared to 2021. Net discrete tax benefits were $27.6 million in 2022, an increase of $1.0 million from $26.6 million in 2021. Discrete tax benefits in both the 2022 and 2021 periods included excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation ($9.1 million and $4.3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively), the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits ($6.9 million and $22.5 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively) due to, in 2021, the partial release of certain reserves for an unrecognized tax benefit and related interest in a non-U.S. jurisdiction based on a change in our assessment of the technical merits of that position associated with the availability of new information, and in both years due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations, the release of valuation allowances due to a change in judgment about realizability of deferred tax assets ($4.6 million and $4.4 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively), tax benefits related to the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from enacted legislation ($3.9 million and $4.0 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively), and other discrete items. In 2022, other discrete tax items included $2.3 million of tax benefits related to the sale of an asset associated with a previously exited line of business. In 2021, other discrete tax items included $10.4 million of deferred state tax expense directly related to our December 2020 acquisition of FONA. See note 13 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate with the effective tax rate.

 2022 2021
Income from unconsolidated operations $ 37.8 $ 52.2

Income from unconsolidated operations, which is presented net of the elimination of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased $14.4 million in 2022 from the prior year. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures, including our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, that comprised 84% and 62% of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the after-tax gain of $13.4 million on the sale of an unconsolidated operation that occurred in 2021.
We reported diluted earnings per share of $2.52 in 2022, compared to $2.80 in 2021. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2021 to 2022. The decrease in operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2022.

Foreign exchange (2.1) % 2.2 %

Segment operating income $ 710.7 $ 804.9
Segment operating income margin 18.9 % 20.4 %

Sales of our consumer segment in 2022 decreased by 4.6% as compared to 2021 and decreased by 2.5% on a constant currency basis. The sales decrease was driven by lower sales of our consumer business in the Americas, EMEA and Asia/Pacific regions. Lower volume and unfavorable product mix decreased sales by 9.3%. The impact of restrictive measures related to COVID-19 resurgences in China, the exit of our consumer operations in Russia, and the exit of our rice product line in India, contributed approximately 1.5% to that decline as compared to 2021. Pricing actions, taken in response to inflationary cost pressures, increased sales by 7.4% in 2022 as compared to the prior year level. The divestiture of our Kitchen Basics business unfavorably impacted sales by 0.6% as compared to 2021. An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 2.1% compared to the prior year and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 2.5% on a constant currency basis.
In the Americas region, consumer sales decreased 1.1% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and decreased by 0.9% on a constant currency basis. Unfavorable volume and product mix decreased sales by 8.6% as compared to the corresponding period in 2021, including the unfavorable impact of price elasticity. Pricing actions, taken in response to higher costs, increased sales by 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The sale of our Kitchen Basics business unfavorably impacted sales by 0.9% as compared to 2021. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates decreased sales by 0.2% in the year and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 0.9% on a constant currency basis.
In the EMEA region, consumer sales decreased 14.7% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and decreased by 5.1% on a constant currency basis. Unfavorable volume and product mix decreased sales by 10.5% as compared to the corresponding period of 2021. The decrease was driven by lower sales of our consumer business in France as compared to the prior year. The exit of our consumer operations in Russia also contributed approximately 2.1% to the region's decline in volume and mix. Pricing actions, taken in response to the inflationary cost environment, increased sales by 5.4% as compared to the 2021 period. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by 9.6% compared to 2021 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 5.1% on a constant currency basis.
In the Asia/Pacific region, consumer sales decreased 10.1% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and decreased by 8.1% on a constant currency basis. Lower volume and unfavorable product mix decreased sales by 11.5% as compared to the corresponding period in 2021. The impact of restrictive measures related to COVID-19 resurgences in China and the exit of our rice product line in India, contributed approximately 9.5% to that decline as compared to 2021. Pricing actions, taken in response to the inflationary cost environment, increased sales by 3.4% as compared to the prior year. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 2.0% compared to the year-ago period and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 8.1% on a constant currency basis.

30

Segment operating income for our consumer segment decreased by $94.2 million, or 11.7%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease in segment operating income was driven by lower sales and increased commodity, transportation and conversion costs, partially offset by pricing actions in response to increased costs, CCI-led cost savings and lower performance-based employee incentive expenses, all as compared to the prior year. Segment operating margin for our consumer segment decreased by 150 basis points in 2022 to 18.9%, driven by a decrease in consumer gross profit margin, including the margin dilutive impact of pricing actions, the impact of the inflationary cost environment, and higher conversion costs, which was partially offset by the impact of CCI-led cost savings, all as compared to the 2021 level. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our consumer segment decreased by 10.9% in 2022, as compared to 2021.
Flavor Solutions Segment

-------------------------------------------------------------- ----- ------- ---- - -------
 2022 2021
Net sales $ 2,592.6 $ 2,380.4

Acquisitions 0.4 % 7.3 %
Foreign exchange (3.2) % 2.8 %

Segment operating income $ 206.7 $ 296.6
Segment operating income margin 8.0 % 12.5 %

Sales of our flavor solutions segment increased 8.9% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and increased by 12.1% on a constant currency basis. Volume and product mix contributed 3.5% of the increase in addition to pricing actions which added 8.2% to sales for 2022, both in comparison to the prior year levels. The incremental impact of our acquisition of FONA added 0.4% to segment sales for 2022. An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 3.2% compared to the prior year and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 12.1% on a constant currency basis.
In the Americas region, flavor solutions sales increased by 11.4% during 2022 as compared to 2021 and increased by 11.7% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased flavor solutions sales in the Americas by 2.2% during 2022, as growth in sales to packaged food and beverage companies was partially offset by lower sales to quick service restaurants, both as compared to the year ago period. Pricing actions, taken in response to the inflationary cost environment, favorably impacted sales by 8.9% during 2022 as compared to the prior year. The incremental impact of our acquisition of FONA added 0.6% to segment sales for 2022. An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 0.3% compared to 2021 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 11.7% on a constant currency basis.
In the EMEA region, flavor solutions sales in 2022 increased by 5.5% as compared to 2021 and increased by 17.2% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased segment sales by 9.5% in 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase was driven by higher sales to quick service restaurants, branded foodservice and package food and beverage company customers. Pricing actions, taken in response to the inflationary cost environment, favorably impacted sales by 7.7% in 2022 as compared to the prior period level. An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 11.7% compared to 2021 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 17.2% on a constant currency basis.
In the Asia/Pacific region, flavor solutions sales decreased 0.2% in 2022 as compared to 2021 and increased by 5.2% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased sales by 0.3%, driven by higher sales to quick service restaurant customers, partially impacted by the timing of customers' promotional activities. Pricing actions, taken in response to the inflationary cost environment, favorably impacted sales by 4.9% as compared to the prior year. An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 5.4% compared to 2021 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 5.2% on a constant currency basis.
Segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment decreased by $89.9 million, or 30.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease in segment operating income was driven by increased commodity, transportation and conversion costs, as well as costs related to supply chain investments, which were partially offset by a higher level of sales, including pricing actions in response to the inflationary cost environment, and CCI-led cost savings, all as compared to the prior year. Segment operating margin for our flavor solutions segment decreased by 450

31

basis points in 2022 to 8.0% driven by a lower segment gross margin, including the margin dilutive impact of pricing actions, the impact of the inflationary cost environment, and higher conversion costs, including the costs related to our supply chain investments, partially offset by CCI-led cost savings and a decrease in SG&A as percentage of sales associated with the favorable impact of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher sales base, all as compared to the 2021 level. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment decreased by 27.9% in 2022, as compared to 2021.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2021 COMPARED TO 2020

-------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ------- ----- - -------
 2021 2020
Net sales $ 6,317.9 $ 5,601.3
Percent growth 12.8 % 4.7 %
Components of percent growth in net sales–increase (decrease):
Volume and product mix 5.5 % 3.7 %
Pricing actions 0.8 % 1.6 %
Acquisitions 4.1 % — %
Foreign exchange 2.4 % (0.6) %

Sales for 2021 increased by 12.8% from 2020 and by 10.4% on a constant currency basis. That 12.8% sales increase was driven by higher sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. On a consolidated basis, higher volume and favorable product mix increased sales by 5.5% while pricing actions, which were primarily taken in the fourth quarter, added 0.8% to sales. That net volume increase and favorable mix was driven by continued levels of strong demand within our consumer segment, as the shift in consumer behavior toward at-home meal preparation, first seen in 2020 as a response to actions taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, has persisted. In addition, our flavor solutions segment volume increased principally due to a recovery in demand for away-from-home products, including higher sales to our branded food service customers, as compared to 2020. Sales were also impacted by favorable foreign currency rates that increased net sales 2.4% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 10.4% on a constant currency basis.

------------------- ---- ------- ---- - -------
 2021 2020
Gross profit $ 2,494.6 $ 2,300.4
Gross profit margin 39.5 % 41.1 %

In 2021, our gross profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 39.5% from 41.1% in 2020. The decline was driven by the impact of increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs, higher conversion costs, which includes costs associated with COVID-19, and a less favorable mix in sales between our consumer and flavor solutions segments as compared to 2020. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by savings from our CCI program, pricing actions, improved product mix and the accretive impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, each as compared to the prior year. In addition, our 2021 gross profit margin was burdened by (i) $6.3 million of transaction expense, representing the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the acquired inventories of Cholula and FONA upon our sale of those acquired inventories, and (ii) a non-cash special charge of $4.7 million associated with the exit of a low margin business in our Asia/Pacific region. Excluding the transaction expense and special charges, adjusted gross profit margin decreased by 140 basis points from 41.1% in 2020 to 39.7% for the year ended November 30, 2021.

 2021 2020
Selling, general & administrative expense $ 1,404.1 $ 1,281.6
Percent of net sales 22.3 % 22.9 %

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $1,404.1 million in 2021 compared to $1,281.6 million in 2020, an increase of $122.5 million. That increase in SG&A expense was primarily a result of (i) SG&A associated with the Cholula and FONA acquisitions; (ii) greater selling and distribution expenses associated with the higher sales volume; and (iii) increased brand marketing costs, all as compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Those increases were partially offset by lower performance-based employee incentive expenses, as compared to the prior year. SG&A as a percent of net sales for 2021 decreased by 60 basis points from the prior year level, driven by the impact of the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher level of sales during the 2021 period.

 2021 2020
Special charges included in cost of goods sold $ 4.7 $ —

Total special charges $ 51.1 $ 6.9

We regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify and/or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time, those changes are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/ structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our Management Committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements.

During 2021, we recorded $51.1 million of special charges, consisting principally of (i) $19.5 million associated with our exit of our rice product line in India, as more fully described below, (ii) $6.2 million associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in EMEA, (iii) streamlining actions of $10.3 million in the Americas region and $4.8 million in the EMEA region, and (iv) a non-cash asset impairment charge of $6.0 million associated with an administrative site that was sold in conjunction with our decision to employ a hybrid work environment. As more fully described in note 3 of our notes of consolidated financial statements, the $19.5 million special charge associated with the exit of our rice product line in India consisted of an $11.2 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the impairment of certain intangible assets, $3.6 million of employee severance and other related exit costs, and a $4.7 million charge in cost of goods sold which represents a provision for the excess of the carrying value of rice inventories over the estimated net realizable value and a contractual obligation associated with terminating a rice supply agreement.
During 2020, we recorded $6.9 million of special charges, consisting of $5.3 million related to streamlining actions in our EMEA region and $1.6 million related to our GE initiative.

Transaction expenses included in cost of goods sold $ 6.3 $ —
Other transaction and integration expenses 29.0 12.4
Total transaction and integration expenses $ 35.3 $ 12.4

During 2021, we recorded transaction and integration expenses of $35.3 million related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. These costs consisted of (i) $6.3 million of amortization of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment of inventories that is included in Cost of goods sold, (ii) $13.8 million of other transaction expenses primarily related to outside advisory, service and consulting costs, and (iii) $15.2 million of integration expenses. Transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA of $11.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, were incurred late in fiscal 2020.

Operating income increased by $15.6 million, or 1.6%, from $999.5 million in 2020 to $1,015.1 million in 2021. Special charges and transaction and integration expenses increased by $67.1 million in 2021, as compared to 2020, and negatively impacted operating income. Operating income as a percentage of net sales declined by 170 basis points in 2021, to 16.1% in 2021 from 17.8% in 2020 as a result of the factors previously described. Excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described, adjusted operating income was $1,101.5 million in 2021 as compared to $1,018.8 million in 2020, an increase of $82.7 million or 8.1% over the 2020 level. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales declined by 80 basis points in 2021, to 17.4% in 2021 from 18.2% in 2020.

as lower non-service cost income associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans was partially offset by higher interest income, as compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by non-operating foreign currency transaction gains in 2021, as compared to non-operating foreign currency transaction losses in the prior period.

 2021 2020
Income from consolidated operations before income taxes $ 895.8 $ 881.5
Income tax expense 192.7 174.9
Effective tax rate 21.5 % 19.8 %

The provision for income taxes is based on the estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period. We record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of U.S. GAAP. Examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income include, but are not limited to, excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years, including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations, provision-to-return adjustments, the settlement of tax audits, changes in enacted tax rates, changes in the assessment of deferred tax valuation allowances, acquisition related deferred tax adjustments, and the tax effects of certain intra-entity asset transfers (other than inventory).
The effective tax rate was 21.5% in 2021 as compared to 19.8% in 2020. The increase in our effective tax rate was principally attributable to the lower level of net discrete tax benefits in 2021 as compared to 2020. Net discrete tax benefits were $26.6 million in 2021, a decrease of $16.8 million from $43.4 million in 2020. Discrete tax benefits in both the 2021 and 2020 periods included excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation ($4.3 million and $14.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively), the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits ($22.5 million and $4.9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively) due to, in 2021, the partial release of certain reserves for an unrecognized tax benefit and related interest in a non-U.S. jurisdiction based on a change in our assessment of the technical merits of that position associated with the availability of new information, and in both years due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations, the release of valuation allowances due to a change in judgment about realizability of deferred tax assets ($4.4 million and $11.9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively) and other discrete items. In 2021, discrete tax items included $4.0 million of tax benefits related to the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from enacted legislation and $10.4 million of deferred state tax expense directly related to our December 2020 acquisition of FONA. In 2020, discrete tax items included $9.9 million of tax benefits associated with intra-entity asset transfers that occurred.

 2021 2020
Income from unconsolidated operations $ 52.2 $ 40.8

Income from unconsolidated operations, which is presented net of the elimination of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, increased $11.4 million in 2021 from the prior year, driven by an after-tax gain of $13.4 million on the sale of our 26% interest in Eastern Condiments Private Ltd. (Eastern), an unconsolidated operation, during our second quarter of 2021, as more fully described in note 5 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures, including our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, that comprised 62% and 75% of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The relative impact of McCormick de Mexico on income from unconsolidated operations in 2021 was impacted by the gain on our sale of an unconsolidated operation.

We reported diluted earnings per share of $2.80 in 2021, compared to $2.78 in 2020. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2020 to 2021.

Sales of our consumer segment in 2021 grew by 9.5% as compared to 2020 and grew by 7.3% on a constant currency basis. This increase included higher sales of our consumer business in each of our three regions. Higher volume and product mix increased sales 4.3% while pricing actions added 0.6% to sales, both as compared to the prior year. The incremental impact of the Cholula acquisition added 2.4% to segment sales during 2021. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased consumer segment sales by 2.2% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 7.3% on a constant currency basis.

In the Americas region, consumer sales increased 7.3% in 2021 as compared to 2020, which experienced a 13.9% increase in sales from the 2019 level as a result of exceptionally strong demand for our products in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased by 6.7% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased sales by 3.0% as compared to the corresponding period in 2020, as demand continues to be driven by consumers' sustained preference for eating more at home. In addition, pricing actions, taken in response to higher costs, increased sales by 0.4% as compared to the prior year. The incremental impact of the Cholula acquisition added 3.3% to sales in 2021. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 0.6% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 6.7% on a constant currency basis.

In the EMEA region, consumer sales increased 5.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020, which experienced a 14.5% increase in sales from the 2019 level driven by the COVID-19 impact on greater consumer at-home meal preparation, and increased by 0.9% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased sales by 0.3% as compared to the corresponding period of 2020. The impact of pricing actions increased sales by 0.6% as compared to the prior year. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 4.9% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 0.9% on a constant currency basis.
In the Asia/Pacific region, consumer sales increased 31.6% in 2021 as compared to 2020, which reflected a 16.6% decrease in sales from the 2019 level due mainly to COVID-19 disruption on foodservice sales in China, and increased by 22.9% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and favorable product mix increased sales by 21.5% as compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The increase was driven by sales related to the recovery of demand in away-from-home consumption in China. Pricing actions increased sales by 1.4% as compared to 2020. The favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 8.7% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 22.9% on a constant currency basis.
Segment operating income for our consumer segment increased by $24.0 million, or 3.1%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in segment operating income was driven by higher sales, including the impact of acquisitions,

35

CCI-led cost savings and lower incentive-based compensation accruals which were partially offset by increased commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs, increased conversion costs, which include incremental expenses related to COVID-19, and higher brand marketing investment, all as compared to the prior year. The impact of COVID-19 on segment operating income during 2021 reflected actions, including the incremental impact of temporary arrangements to utilize co-manufacturing, that increased our cost to produce certain products and measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning that reduced productivity. Segment operating margin for our consumer segment decreased by 130 basis points in 2021 to 20.4%, driven by a decrease in segment gross profit margin, including the impact of the inflationary cost environment, which was partially offset by the benefit from the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher sales base as compared to the 2020 level. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our consumer segment increased by 1.3% in 2021, as compared to 2020.

Sales of our flavor solutions segment increased 18.7% in 2021 as compared to 2020 and increased by 15.9% on a constant currency basis. Sales were favorably impacted by the recovery of demand as compared to the lower level of demand in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 disruption on our quick service restaurant and branded food service customers, particularly in the Americas and EMEA regions. Favorable volume and product mix increased segment sales by 7.2% as compared to 2020, while pricing actions taken in response to increased costs during the period increased sales by 1.4%. The incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions increased sales by 7.3% in 2021. The favorable impact of foreign currency rates increased flavor solutions segment sales by 2.8% as compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 15.9% on a constant currency basis.

In the Americas region, flavor solutions sales increased by 16.6% during 2021 as compared to 2020, which experienced a sales decline of 3.5% from the 2019 level driven by lower sales to quick service restaurant and branded food service customers as a result of COVID-19 restrictions imposed in the early stages of the pandemic, and increased by 15.4% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and improved product mix increased flavor solutions sales in the Americas by 3.2% during 2021, driven primarily by increased sales to branded foodservice and quick service restaurant customers. Pricing actions increased sales by 1.7% as compared to the prior year. The incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions increased sales by 10.5% in 2021. A favorable impact from foreign currency rates increased sales by 1.2% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 15.4% on a constant currency basis.

In the EMEA region, flavor solutions sales in 2021 increased by 27.3% as compared to 2020, which experienced a sales decline of 5.5% from the 2019 level primarily as a result of decreased sales to quick service restaurants and lower branded food service sales that were partially offset by higher demand from packaged food service companies in response to COVID-19 restrictions implemented in 2020, and increased by 21.5% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased segment sales by 19.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales to branded foodservice, packaged food and quick service restaurant customers. Pricing actions increased sales by 1.7% in 2021 as compared the prior year level. A favorable impact from foreign currency rates increased sales by 5.8% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 21.5% on a constant currency basis.

In the Asia/Pacific region, flavor solutions sales increased 16.9% in 2021 as compared to 2020, which experienced a sales increase of 0.4% from the 2019 level driven by higher sales to quick service restaurant customers, and increased by 9.4% on a constant currency basis.

Segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment increased by $58.7 million, or 24.7%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in segment operating income was driven by higher sales, including the impact of acquisitions, CCI-led cost savings, lower incentive-based compensation accruals and favorable product mix, which was partially offset by increased commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Segment operating margin for our flavor solutions segment increased by 60 basis points in 2021 to 12.5% as the benefits from the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher sales base as compared to the 2020 level, together with the accretive impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions on gross margins, were partially offset by the impact of the inflationary cost environment as compared to 2020. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment increased by 22.5% in 2021, as compared to 2020.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The following tables include financial measures of adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These represent non-GAAP financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These financial measures exclude the impact, as applicable, of the following:
•Special charges – Special charges consist of expenses and income associated with certain actions undertaken by us to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (generally including details with respect to estimated costs, which typically consist principally of employee severance and related benefits, together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non-cash component, such as an asset impairment, or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold; impacted employees or operations; expected timing; and expected savings) to the Management Committee and the Committee’s advance approval, expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an ongoing basis through completion. Special charges for the year ended November 30, 2022 include a $13.6 million gain associated with the sale of the Kohinoor brand name. We exited our Kohinoor rice product line in India in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.
•Transaction and integration expenses associated with the Cholula and FONA acquisitions – We exclude certain costs associated with our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA in November and December 2020, respectively, and their subsequent integration into the Company. Such costs, which we refer to as “Transaction and integration expenses,” include transaction costs associated with each acquisition, as well as integration costs following the respective acquisition, including the impact of the acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventories, together with the impact of discrete tax items, if any, directly related to each acquisition.
•Income from sale of unconsolidated operations – We exclude the gain realized upon our sale of an unconsolidated operation in March 2021. As more fully described in note 5 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements, the sale of our 26% interest in Eastern Condiments resulted in a gain of $13.4 million, net of tax of $5.7 million. The gain is included in Income from unconsolidated operations in our consolidated income statement for the year ended November 30, 2021.
•Gain on sale of Kitchen Basics – We exclude the gain realized upon our sale of the Kitchen Basics business in August 2022. As more fully described in note 17 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements, the pre-tax gain associated with the sale was $49.6 million and is included in Other income, net in our consolidated income statement for the year ended November 30, 2022.
Details with respect to the composition of transaction and integration expenses, special charges, income from the sale of unconsolidated operations, and gain on sale of Kitchen Basics for the years and in the amounts set forth below are included in notes 2, 3, and 5, of notes to our consolidated financial statements.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important. The exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends.
These non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting.
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial results is provided below:

(1) Transaction and integration expenses are more fully described in note 2 of notes to our consolidated financial statements and include transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. These expenses include the effect of the fair value adjustment to acquired inventories on cost of goods sold and the impact of a discrete deferred state income tax expense item, directly related to our December 2020 acquisition of FONA. The discrete tax item had an unfavorable impact of $10.4 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the year ended November 30, 2021.
(2) Special charges are more fully described in note 3 of notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Special charges for the year ended November 30, 2022 include a $10.0 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge associated with our exit of our business operations in Russia. We exited our Kohinoor rice product line in India in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Special charges for the year ended November 30, 2022 include a $13.6 million gain associated with the sale of the Kohinoor brand name. Special charges for the year ended November 30, 2021 include $4.7 million which is reflected in Cost of goods sold and an $11.2 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the impairment of certain intangible assets.

Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis,” is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).
Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year. The tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows: (1) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2022 on a constant currency basis, net sales and adjusted operating income for 2022 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2021 and compared to the reported results for 2021; and (2) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2021 on a constant currency basis, net sales and operating income for 2021 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2020 and compared to the reported results for 2020.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

--------------------------------------------------- ------- ----- ------- - --------- - -------
 2022 2021 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 651.5 $ 828.3 $ 1,041.3
Net cash used in investing activities (146.4) (908.6) (1,025.6)
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (487.2) 22.0 220.9

The primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. We use a combination of equity and short- and long-term debt. We use short-term debt, comprised primarily of commercial paper, principally to finance ongoing operations, including our requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities). We are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings.
Our cash flows from operations enable us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives, service our debt, fund or increase our quarterly dividends, fund capital projects and other investments, and make share repurchases when appropriate. Due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business, our cash flow from operations has historically been the strongest during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Due to the timing of the interest payments on our debt, interest payments are higher in the first and third quarter of our fiscal year.
We believe that our sources of liquidity, which include existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, our commercial paper program, and access to capital markets, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.
In the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the translation effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these do not reflect actual cash flows. In addition, in the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effect of acquired or disposed operating assets and liabilities, as the cash flows associated with acquisition or dispositions of businesses is presented as an investing activity. Accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet.
The reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods. At November 30, 2022, the exchange rates for the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Australian dollar, and Polish zloty were lower than the U.S. dollar than at November 30, 2021.
Operating Cash Flow – Operating cash flow was $651.5 million in 2022, $828.3 million in 2021, and $1,041.3 million in 2020. Net income as well as our working capital management, as more fully described below, impacted operating cash flow. In 2022, the decrease was primarily driven by lower net income, including the effect of net income associated with the gain on sale of our Kitchen Basics business and an intangible asset that are reflected as investing cash flows as well as the timing of certain employee incentive payments. In 2021, the reduction in operating cash flow was the result of increased inventory levels to protect against supply disruption, employee incentive payments, and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions. In 2020, the increase in operating cash flow was the result of a significantly lower use of cash associated with other assets and liabilities, including the timing of certain employee incentive and customer related payments, which was partially offset by the use of cash associated with working capital, driven by the increased level of inventory to meet demand.
Our working capital management – principally related to inventory, trade accounts receivable, and accounts payable – impacts our operating cash flow. The change in inventory was a significant use of cash from operations in 2022, 2021, and 2020. The change in trade accounts receivable was a use of cash in 2022 and 2021 but a source of cash in 2020. The change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in 2022 and 2020 and a more moderate source of cash in 2021.
In addition to operating cash flow, we also use cash conversion cycle (CCC) to measure our working capital management. This metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures. CCC is a calculation of the number of days, on average, that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources, such as raw materials, to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable. Our goal is to lower our CCC over time. We calculate CCC as follows:

41

Days sales outstanding (average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales) plus days in inventory (average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold) less days payable outstanding (average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory).
The following table outlines our cash conversion cycle (in days) over the last three years:

--------------------- ---- ---- ---- --
 2022 2021 2020
Cash Conversion Cycle 51 46 39

The increase in CCC in 2022 from 2021 was due primarily to an increase in our days in inventory as a result of cost inflation, strategic purchases to avoid shipping challenges, and lower than forecasted sales. The increase in CCC in 2021 from 2020 was due primarily to an increase in our days in inventory as a result of efforts to protect against supply chain disruption and to meet increased demand. During both periods, the increase in days in inventory was partially offset by an increase in our days payable outstanding.
We offer certain suppliers access to a third-party Supply Chain Finance program (SCF) with several global financial institutions (SCF Banks). Under the SCF, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from us to an SCF Bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective SCF Bank. While we are not party to those agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize our creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. This generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with a SCF Bank, the supplier elects which of our individual invoices they sell to the SCF bank. However, all of our payments to participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The SCF Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The program has been in place for over five years and commenced near the same time we began an initiative to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers in response to evolving market practices.
The terms of our payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF. Our payment terms with our suppliers for similar materials within individual markets are consistent between those suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those suppliers that do not participate. Accordingly, our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF. For our participating suppliers, we believe substantially all of their receivables with us are sold to the SCF Banks. Accordingly, we would expect that at each balance sheet date, a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to SCF Banks. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded within the line entitled "Trade accounts payable" in our consolidated balance sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows. As of November 30, 2022 and 2021, the amount due to suppliers participating in the SCF and included in "Trade accounts payable" were approximately $347.0 million and $274.3 million, respectively.
Future changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments, such as changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or our creditworthiness relative to participating suppliers could impact those suppliers’ participation in the SCF and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to predict.
Investing Cash Flow – Net cash used in investing activities was $146.4 million in 2022, $908.6 million in 2021, and $1,025.6 million in 2020. Our primary investing cash flows include the usage of cash associated with acquisition of businesses and capital expenditures as well as cash provided by sale of businesses, unconsolidated operations, or other assets. Cash usage related to our acquisition of businesses was $706.4 million and $803.0 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Capital expenditures, including expenditures for capitalized software, were $262.0 million in 2022, $278.0 million in 2021, and $225.3 million in 2020. We expect 2023 capital expenditures to approximate $280 million to support our planned growth. In 2022, we received $95.2 million net cash proceeds received from the sale of our Kitchen Basics business and $13.6 million net cash proceeds received on the sale of the Kohinoor brand name which are more fully discussed in notes 2 and 3, respectively, of notes to our consolidated financial statements. Our primary investing cash inflow in 2021 was the $65.4 million of proceeds received from the sale of an unconsolidated operation, as more fully discussed in note 5 of notes to our consolidated financial statements.

42

Financing Cash Flow – Net cash associated with financing activities was a use of cash of $487.2 million in 2022 and a source of cash of $22.0 million and $220.9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The variability between years is principally a result of changes in our net borrowings, share repurchase activity and dividends, all as described below.
The following table outlines our net borrowing activities:

In 2022, we repaid $772.0 million of long-term debt, including the $750 million, 2.70% notes that matured on August 15, 2022.
In 2021, we borrowed $1,001.5 million under long-term borrowing arrangements, including net proceeds of $495.7 million of 0.9% notes due February 2026 and net proceeds of $492.8 million of 1.85% notes due February 2031. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to pay down short-term borrowings, including a portion of the $1,443.0 million of commercial paper issued to fund our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, and for general corporate purposes. We also repaid $257.1 million of long-term debt, including the $250 million, 3.90% notes that matured in July 2021.
In 2020, we borrowed $527.0 million under long-term borrowing arrangements, including net proceeds of $495.0 million of 2.5% notes due April 2030. We also repaid $257.7 million of long-term debt, including $250.0 million associated with our term loans due in August 2022.
The following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs:

 2022 2021 2020
Number of shares of common stock 0.4 0.1 0.5
Dollar amount $ 38.8 $ 8.6 $ 47.3

As of November 30, 2022, $537 million remained of a $600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2019. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Our share repurchase activity in 2022, 2021, and 2020 has principally been executed in order to mitigate the effect of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options.
During 2022, 2021 and 2020, we received proceeds of $41.4 million, $13.5 million and $56.6 million, respectively, from exercised stock options. We repurchased $19.4 million, $15.4 million and $13.0 million of common stock during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in conjunction with employee tax withholding requirements associated with our stock compensation plans.
Our dividend history over the past three years is as follows:

----------------------------- ---- ----- ---- - ----- - - -----
 2022 2021 2020
Total dividends paid $ 396.7 $ 363.3 $ 330.1
Dividends paid per share 1.48 1.36 1.24
Percentage increase per share 8.8 % 9.7 % 8.8 %

In November 2022, the Board of Directors approved a 5.4% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.37 to $0.39 per share.
Most of our cash is in our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. Those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations, capital projects and future acquisitions. As of November 30, 2022, we have $1.4 billion of earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint ventures that are considered indefinitely reinvested. We have not provided any deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes, other income taxes, or foreign exchange gains or losses. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.

43

At November 30, 2022, we temporarily used $191.0 million of cash from our non-U.S. subsidiaries to pay down short-term debt in the U.S. During the year, our short-term borrowings vary, but are lower at the end of a year or quarter. The average short-term borrowings outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 were $1,117.0 million and $1,029.9 million, respectively. Those average short-term borrowings outstanding for the year ended November 30, 2022 included average commercial paper borrowings of $1,080.4 million. The total average debt outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2022 and 2021 was $5,422.0 million and $5,574.5 million, respectively.
Credit and Capital Markets – The following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business:

CREDIT FACILITIES – Cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth, share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We also rely on our revolving credit facilities, or borrowings backed by these facilities, to fund working capital needs and other general corporate requirements.
Our committed revolving credit facilities include a five-year $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which will expire in June 2026 and a 364-day $500 million revolving credit facility, which was entered into in July 2022 and will expire in July 2023. The current pricing for the five-year credit facility, on a fully drawn basis, is LIBOR plus 1.25%. The pricing of that credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%. The current pricing for the 364-day credit facility, on a fully drawn basis, is SOFR plus 1.23%. The pricing of that credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to SOFR plus 1.60%.
The provisions of each revolving credit facility restrict subsidiary indebtedness and require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. We do not expect that this covenant would limit our access to either revolving credit facilities for the foreseeable future. The terms of those revolving credit facilities are more fully described in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
We generally use our revolving credit facilities to support our issuance of commercial paper. If the commercial paper market is not available or viable, we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facilities. These facilities are made available by a syndicate of banks, with various commitments per bank. If any of the banks in these syndicates are unable to perform on their commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital. We engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facilities. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe our banks will perform on their commitments. In addition to our committed revolving credit facilities, we have uncommitted facilities of $302.5 million as of November 30, 2022 that can be withdrawn based upon the lenders' discretion. See note 6 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements.
We will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest, to service debt, and to fund acquisitions. As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. Our primary obligations include principal and interest payments on our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt. In the next year, our most significant debt service obligation is the maturity of our $250.0 million, 3.50% notes due in September 2023. Also in July 2023, our $500 million, 364-day revolving credit facility matures. Detail on these contractual obligations follows:
MATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS
The following table reflects a summary of our future material cash requirements as of November 30, 2022:

---------------------------------------- ------- --------------- --------- --------- ---------------- ------- ------- ------- - ------- - -------
 Total Less than1 year 1–3 years 3–5 years More than5 years
Short-term borrowings $ 1,236.7 $ 1,236.7 $ — $ — $ —
Long-term debt, including finance leases 3,981.1 270.6 1,066.6 1,268.8 1,375.1
Interest payments(a) 724.5 110.0 176.9 156.3 281.3
Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,942.3 $ 1,617.3 $ 1,243.5 $ 1,425.1 $ 1,656.4

44

(a)Interest payments include interest payments on long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings, principally consisting of commercial paper, have short-term maturities. We anticipate total interest expense for the year ending November 30, 2023 to approximate $200 million to $210 million, which we expect will also approximate cash interest payments for the same period. See note 6 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Our other cash requirements at year end include raw material purchases, lease payments, income taxes, and pension and postretirement benefits. We acquire various raw materials to satisfy our obligations to our customers, and these outstanding purchase obligations can fluctuate throughout the year based on our response to varying raw material cycles; however, these commitments generally do not extend past one year. In addition, we also have a series of commercial commitments, largely consisting of standby letters of credit. Our standby letters of credit, leases, and pension and other post retirement obligations are more fully described in notes 6, 7 and 11, respectively, of notes to our consolidated financial statements.
These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. To meet those cash requirements, we intend to use our existing cash, cash equivalents and internally generated funds, to borrow under our existing credit facilities or under other short-term borrowing facilities, and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular debt maturity or acquisition to our then-available sources of funds, to obtain additional short- and long-term financing. We believe that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our future cash requirements.
PENSION ASSETS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS – We hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. Cash contributions to pension plans, including unfunded plans, were $11.4 million in 2022, $15.0 million in 2021, and $11.9 million in 2020. It is expected that the 2023 total pension plan contributions will be approximately $13 million. Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent upon changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. We base our investment of plan assets, in part, on the duration of each plan’s liabilities. Across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans, approximately 55% of assets are invested in equities, 32% in fixed income investments and 13% in other investments. Assets associated with our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan are primarily invested in corporate-owned life insurance, the value of which approximates an investment mix of 60% in equities and 40% in fixed income investments. See note 11 of notes to our consolidated financial statements, which provides details on our pension funding.
CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES – See the subsequent section of this discussion under the heading "Market Risk Sensitivity–Credit Risk."

ACQUISITIONS
Acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits.
On December 30, 2020, we purchased FONA. The purchase price was approximately $708 million, net of cash acquired. FONA is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food, beverage and nutritional markets. Our acquisition of FONA expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories, as well as extends our technology platform and strengthens our capabilities. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term borrowings. The results of FONA's operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our flavor solutions segment from the date of acquisition.
On November 30, 2020, we purchased Cholula for approximately $801 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term borrowings. Cholula, a premium Mexican hot sauce brand, is a strong addition to our global branded flavor portfolio, which broadens our offerings in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic Mexican flavor hot sauce. The results of Cholula’s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition.
See note 2 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY
We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 8 of notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Exchange Risk – We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, Swiss franc, and Mexican peso, as well as the Euro versus the British pound sterling, Australian dollar, and Polish zloty, and finally the Canadian dollar versus British pound sterling. We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks.

46

During 2022, the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in our subsidiaries with a functional currency of the British pound sterling, Euro, Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.
We also utilize cross currency interest rate swap contracts, which are designated as net investment hedges, to manage the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in subsidiaries with a functional currency of the British pound sterling and Euro. Gains and losses on these instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
The following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at November 30, 2022. All contracts are valued in U.S. dollars using year-end 2022 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures, firm commitments or anticipated transactions.

We had a number of smaller contracts at November 30, 2022 with an aggregate notional value of $11.5 million to purchase or sell other currencies, such as the Romanian leu. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was insignificant at November 30, 2022.
At November 30, 2021, we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Polish zloty, Swiss franc and other currencies, with a notional value of $583.6 million. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $5.5 million at November 30, 2021.
We also utilized cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are considered net investment hedges.
As of November 30, 2022 and 2021, we had cross currency interest rate swap contracts of (i) $250 million notional value to receive $250 million at three-month U.S. LIBOR plus 0.685% and pay £194.1 million at three-month GBP SONIA plus 0.859% and (ii) £194.1 million notional value to receive £194.1 million at three-month GBP SONIA plus 0.859% and pay €221.8 million at three-month Euro EURIBOR plus 0.808%. These cross-currency interest rate swap contracts expire in August 2027. In conjunction with the phase-out of LIBOR, during 2022 we amended the terms of this cross currency swaps such that, effective February 15, 2022, we now pay and receive at GBP SONIA plus 0.859% (previously GBP LIBOR plus 0.740%).
As of November 30, 2022, we also had cross currency interest rate swap contracts of (i) $250 million notional value to receive $250 million at USD SOFR plus 0.684% and pay £184.1 million at GBP SONIA plus 0.5740% and (ii) £184.1 million notional value to receive £184.1 million at GBP SONIA plus 0.574% and pay €219.2 million at Euro ESTR plus 0.667%. These contracts expire in April 2030.
Interest Rate Risk – Our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We are exposed to interest rate volatility, with primary exposures related to movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), and commercial paper rates. The phase out of LIBOR reference rates will occur at different dates and began on January 1, 2022. Arrangements that were entered into during the year ended November 30, 2022, including our $500 million

47

364-day revolving credit facility expiring in July 2023, fixed to variable interest rate swaps expiring in April 2030, and cross-currency interest rate swaps expiring in April 2030, no longer use LIBOR as a reference rate. However, LIBOR continues to be the reference rate for our variable rate debt, including our $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in July 2026, interest rate swaps expiring in November 2025 and August 2027, and the cross-currency interest rate swaps expiring in August 2027. Through the year ended November 30, 2022, there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements as a result of the LIBOR phase-out, nor do we expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the duration of the LIBOR transition period.
We also use interest rate swaps to minimize financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates, excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees, by fiscal year of maturity at November 30, 2022. For foreign currency-denominated debt, the information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents. Variable interest rates are based on the weighted-average rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented.

The table above displays the debt, including finance leases, by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value, interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees. Interest rate swaps have the following effects:
•We issued $250 million of 3.50% notes due in 2023 in August 2013. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.30%.
•We issued $250 million of 3.25% notes due in 2025 in November 2015. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.45%. The fixed interest rate on $100 million of the 3.25% notes due in December 2025 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through the notes maturity in 2025. Net interest payments are based on 3-month LIBOR plus 1.22% with an effective variable rate of 5.83% as of November 30, 2022.
•We issued $750 million of 3.40% notes due August 15, 2027 in August 2017. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these $750 million notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.44%. The fixed interest rate on $250 million of the 3.40% notes due in August 2027 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through the notes maturity in 2027. Net interest payments are based on 3-month LIBOR plus 0.685% with an effective variable rate of 5.29% as of November 30, 2022.
•We issued $500 million of 2.50% notes due April 15, 2030. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these $500 million notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 2.62%. The fixed interest rate on $250 million of the 2.50% notes due in April 2030 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through the notes maturity in 2030. Net interest payments are based on USD SOFR plus 0.684% with an effective variable rate of 4.94% as of November 30, 2022.

Commodity Risk – We purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions, growing and harvesting conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. In 2022, our most significant raw materials were dairy products, pepper, onion, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), garlic, wheat products, vegetable oils, and vanilla. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk.
Credit Risk – The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers, dollar stores, warehouse clubs, discount chains and e-commerce. This has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. We continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties. We feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value. We consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

48

New accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations. See note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details of these impacts.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
In preparing the financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe, given current facts and circumstances, our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. In preparing the financial statements, we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets and prepaid allowances. Our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions, which are those that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, are in the following areas:
Customer Contracts
In several of our major geographic markets, the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multi-year customer arrangements. Known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on current expectations regarding what was earned through these programs as of the balance sheet date. Key sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one-year or shorter duration. Estimates that affect revenue, such as trade incentives and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentives or product returns are realized. Certain of our customer arrangements are annual arrangements such that the degree of estimates that affects revenue reduces as a year progresses. We do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of customer consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers.
Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Asset Valuation
We use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. We generally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
Determining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands, while other acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience, the competitive and macroeconomic environment, and our operating plans. The costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. We review the carrying value of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below. We also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, as more fully described in note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements. While we believe those estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.

49

Goodwill Impairment
Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, as more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model. Our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using a market-based discount rate. We then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including intangible assets and goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. As of November 30, 2022, we had $5,212.9 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet ($3,568.2 million in the consumer segment and $1,644.7 million in the flavor solutions segment). Our fiscal year 2022 impairment testing indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill. However, variances between the actual performance of the businesses and the assumptions that were used in developing the estimates of fair value could result in impairment charges in future periods.
Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks. We estimate fair values through the use of the relief-from-royalty method and then compare those fair values to the related carrying amounts of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the event that the fair value of any of the brand names or trademarks are less than their related carrying amounts, a non-cash impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference.

The estimation of fair values of our brand names and trademarks requires us to make significant assumptions, including expectations with respect to sales and profits of the respective brands and trademarks, related royalty rates, income tax rates and appropriate discount rates, which are based, in part, upon current interest rates adjusted for our view of reasonable country- and brand-specific risks based upon the past and anticipated future performance of the related brand names and trademarks. The assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with our operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses.

As of November 30, 2022, we had $3,043.4 million of brand names assets and trademarks recognized in our consolidated balance sheet, and none of the balances exceeded their estimated fair values at that date. Of the $3,043.4 million of brand names assets and trademarks as of November 30, 2022: (i) $2,320.0 million relates to the French’s, Frank’s RedHot and Cattlemen’s brand names and trademarks, recognized as part of our acquisition of RB Foods in August 2017, that we group for purposes of our impairment analysis; (ii) $380.0 million relates to the Cholula brand names and trademarks associated with the acquisition of Cholula in November 2020, (iii) $49.0 million relates to the FONA brand names and trademarks associated with the acquisition of FONA in December 2020 and (iv) the remaining $294.4 million represents a number of other brand name assets and trademarks with individual carrying values ranging from $0.2 million to $106.4 million. Except for four brand names assets and trademarks with a carrying value of approximately $460 million, including our recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, the percentage excess of estimated fair value over respective book values for each of our brand names and trademarks, was 20% or more as of our fourth quarter annual impairment assessment.

The brand names and trademarks related to recent acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, may be more susceptible to future impairment as their carrying values represent recently determined fair values. A change in assumptions with respect to recently acquired businesses, including those affected by rising interest rates or a deterioration in expectations of future sales, profitability or royalty rates as well as future economic and market conditions, or higher income tax rates, could result in non-cash impairment losses in the future.
Income Taxes
We estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return. At the end of each year, an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements. Tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year. A reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time, which will result in changes to the original estimate. We believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported, but tax authorities can challenge certain of our tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the GAAP guidance for uncertainty in income

50

taxes. We recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. A change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. We believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, is adequate. As of November 30, 2022, the Company had $29.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, recorded in Other long-term liabilities. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. We have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In doing so, we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates, as more fully described in note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Pension Benefits
Pension plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in our pension benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligations. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, changes in various assumptions and differences between the actual returns on plan assets and the expected returns on plan assets and changes to projected future rates of return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense or income ultimately recognized. A 1% increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2023 pension benefit expense by approximately $0.4 million. A 1% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2023 pension expense by approximately $9.8 million.

We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the measurement of our pension benefit obligations. In addition, see note 11 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements.

Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...

['s current scope could disrupt our supply chain, broaden inflationary costs, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Sales Growth – Over time, we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from: 1) our base business – driven by brand marketing support, category management, and differentiated customer engagement; 2) new products; and 3) acquisitions.
Base Business – We expect to drive sales growth by optimizing our brand marketing investment through improved speed, quality and effectiveness. We measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified

23

digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support. Through digital marketing, we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes, provide cooking advice and help them discover new products.
New Products – For our consumer segment, we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition, including private label. We are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion, from gourmet, premium items to convenient and value-priced flavors.
For flavor solutions customers, we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products, as well as flavors for new menu items. We have a strong pipeline of flavor solutions products aligned with our customers’ new product launch plans, many of which include clean-label, organic, natural, and “better-for-you” innovation. With over 20 product innovation centers around the world, we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our flavor solutions customers with products that appeal to local consumers.
Acquisitions – Acquisitions are expected to approximate one-third of our sales growth over time. Since the beginning of 2017, we have completed four acquisitions, which are driving sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. We focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health. Geographically, our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets. Information with respect to our two most recent acquisitions is provided below:
•On December 30, 2020, we acquired FONA International, LLC and certain of its affiliates (FONA), a privately owned company, for approximately $708 million, net of cash acquired. We financed this fiscal 2021 acquisition with cash and short-term borrowings. FONA is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food, beverage and nutritional markets which expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories, as well as extends our technology platform, strengthens our capabilities, and accelerates the strategic migration of our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products.
•On November 30, 2020, we acquired the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce® (Cholula) from L Catterton for approximately $801 million, net of cash acquired. Cholula is a strong addition to our global branded flavor portfolio, which broadens our offerings in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic Mexican flavor hot sauce in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments.
Cost Savings and Business Transformation – We are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our CCI program, an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization, as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements that includes our expected elimination of approximately $125 million of costs in 2023 and 2024 as part of our Global Operating Effectiveness program, including $100 million of supply costs and $25 million of costs across the remainder of the organization. Our CCI program funds brand marketing support, product innovation and other growth initiatives. We expect our CCI program, Global Operating Effectiveness program, and organization and streamlining actions to deliver savings of approximately $75 million in 2023.
We are making investments to build the McCormick of the future, including in our Global Enablement (GE) organization to transform McCormick through globally aligned, innovative services to enable growth. As technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment, information sharing and scalability, we are also making investments in our information systems. We continue to progress our global enterprise resource planning (ERP) replacement program which will enable us to accelerate the transformation of our ways of working and provide a scalable platform for growth.
We expect that, in total over the course of the ERP replacement program for our major markets, we will invest approximately $400 million, including expenses related to the go-live activities in our operations, to enable the anticipated completion of the roll out of our new information technology platform to those markets in 2025. Of that projected $400 million, we expect capitalized software to account for approximately 50% and program expenses to account for approximately 50%. Of the approximately $200 million of operating expenses included in our projected total spending, approximately $122 million has been recognized through November 30, 2022. Of the approximately $200 million of capitalized software included in our projected total spending, approximately $137 million has been recognized through November 30, 2022.
Cash Flow – Net cash provided by operating activities was $651.5 million, $828.3 million and $1,041.3 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In 2022, we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment,

24

capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends, with annual increases in each of the past 37 years, and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. In 2022, the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was $435.5 million.
Operating Results – On a long-term basis, we expect a combination of acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayments, and the resulting impact on interest expense, to add about 2% to earnings per share growth.
In 2022, we achieved further growth of our business with net sales rising 0.5% over the 2021 level due to the following factors:
•Pricing actions, including those taken in response to the inflationary cost environment, contributed 7.7% of the increase in net sales.
•Volume and product mix unfavorably impacted our net sales growth by 4.5%, exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures. Our consumer segment experienced unfavorable volume and product mix of 9.3% which included the unfavorable impact of price elasticity as well as the impact of restrictive measures related to COVID-19 resurgences in China, the exit of our consumer operations in Russia, and the exit of our rice product line in India which collectively contributed approximately 1.5% to that decline. Increased volume and product mix of 3.5% in our flavor solutions segment was principally driven by the continued strength of sales to packaged food companies and the continued recovery in away-from-home demand.
•Acquisitions contributed 0.2% of the increase in net sales. Divestitures negatively impacted our net sales increase by 0.4%.
•Net sales growth was negatively impacted by fluctuations in currency rates that decreased sales growth by 2.5%. Excluding this impact, we grew sales by 3.0% over the prior year on a constant currency basis.
Operating income was $863.6 million in 2022 and $1,015.1 million in 2021. We recorded $51.6 million and $51.1 million of special charges in 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to organization and streamlining actions. Special charges in 2021 included $4.7 million in cost of goods sold related the exit of a low margin business. In 2022 and 2021, we also recorded $2.2 million and $35.3 million of transaction and integration expenses, respectively, related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA that reduced operating income. In 2022, compared to the year-ago period, the unfavorable impact of increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs and higher conversion costs more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales, which included the impact of pricing actions taken in response to the inflationary environment, $112 million of cost savings from our CCI program, including organization and streamlining actions, and lower incentive-based compensation. Excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, adjusted operating income was $917.4 million in 2022, a decrease of 16.7%, compared to $1,101.5 million in the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income declined 15.5%. For further details and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to reported amounts, see the subsequent discussion under the heading "]:

Diluted earnings per share was $2.52 in 2022 and $2.80 in 2021. The year-on-year decrease in earnings per share was primarily driven by lower operating income that was partially offset by the favorable effect of a lower level of special charges and transaction and integration expenses in 2022 as compared to 2021. Special charges and transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by $0.15 and $0.30 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. A gain on our sale of a business increased earnings per share by $0.14 in 2022. A gain on our sale of an unconsolidated operation increased earnings per share by $0.05 in 2021. Excluding the effects of special charges, transaction and integration expenses, the gain realized from the sale of a business, and the gain realized from the sale of an unconsolidated operation, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.53 in 2022 and $3.05 in 2021, or a decrease of 17.0%.

2023 Outlook
In 2023, we expect to grow net sales over the 2022 level by 5% to 7%, which includes a minimal impact of foreign currency rates. We anticipate that the 2023 sales growth will be driven by pricing actions, including the completion of those executed in 2022 combined with new pricing actions we are taking in 2023. We expect volume and product mix to be impacted by pricing elasticities, although, consistent with 2022, at a lower level than we have experienced historically. We anticipate that our volume and product mix will also be impacted by the combined impact of lapping last year’s COVID-related disruptions in China, the divestiture of our Kitchen Basics brand in the third quarter of last year, the exit of our consumer business in Russia during the second quarter of last year, and the pruning of low margin businesses.
We expect our 2023 gross profit margin to range from 25 basis points to 75 basis points higher than our gross profit margin of 35.8% in 2022. The projected 2023 increase in gross profit margin is principally due to the net effect of (i) the favorable impact of pricing actions in response to increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs, (ii) the favorable impact of anticipated Global Operating Effectiveness Program and CCI cost savings, and (iii) a low to mid-teen percentage impact of inflation in 2023 compared to 2022. As we recover the cost inflation of our pricing that has lagged in the past two years, we expect cost pressures to be more than offset by pricing actions and our expected cost savings in 2023.
In 2023, we expect an increase in operating income of 10% to 12%, which includes a minimal impact from foreign currency rates, over the 2022 level. The projected 2023 change in operating income includes the effects of cost savings from our Global Operating Effectiveness Program and lapping the COVID-19 restrictive measures in China during 2022, which we anticipate will be partially offset by increased employee incentive compensation and the impact of our Kitchen Basics divestiture. Our CCI-led cost savings target in 2023 is approximately $85 million. We expect that the absence of $2.2 million of integration expenses related to the FONA acquisition in 2022 to favorably impact operating income in 2023. We also expect approximately $50 million of special charges in 2023 that relate to previously announced organization and streamlining actions; in 2022, special charges were $51.6 million. Excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses, we expect 2023’s adjusted operating income to increase by 9% to 11%, which includes a minimal impact from foreign currency rates.
We estimate that our interest expense will range from $200 to $210 million in 2023, with the increase over 2022 being driven by the higher interest-rate environment which will impact our variable rate debt. In 2023, we will also lap the favorable effects associated with the termination of interest rate contracts. These contracts were entered into to manage the interest rate risk associated with our then anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt, which favorably impacted other income, net in 2022.
Our underlying effective tax rate is projected to be higher in 2023 than in 2022. We estimate that our 2023 effective tax rate, including the net favorable impact of anticipated discrete tax items, will be 22% as compared to 20.7% in 2022. Excluding projected taxes associated with special charges, we estimate that our adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 22% in 2023, as compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.9% in 2022.
Diluted earnings per share was $2.52 in 2022. Diluted earnings per share for 2023 is projected to range from $2.42 to $2.47. Excluding the per share impact of (i) special charges of $51.6; (ii) integration expenses of $2.2 million; and (iii) the gain realized upon our sale of Kitchen Basics of $49.6 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.53 in 2022. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding an estimated per share impact from special charges of $0.14, is projected to range from $2.56 to $2.61 in 2023. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow by 1% to 3% over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.53 in 2022, including a minimal impact from foreign currency rates.

Sales for 2022 increased by 0.5% from 2021 and by 3.0% on a constant currency basis (that is, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption, Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Unfavorable volume and product mix decreased sales by 4.5% with growth in our flavor solutions segment being more than offset by a decline in our consumer segment. The impact of restrictive measures related to COVID-19 resurgences in China, the exit of our consumer operations in Russia, and the exit of our rice product line in India, contributed approximately 1.0% to that decline as compared to 2021. In addition, pricing actions, taken in response to the inflationary cost environment, added 7.7% to sales, as compared to the prior year. Acquisitions and a divestiture added to and decreased sales by 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively, both as compared to the prior year. Sales were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency rates that decreased sales by 2.5% in 2022 as compared to the prior year and are excluded from our measure of sales growth of 3.0% on a constant currency basis.

In 2022, gross profit decreased by $220.1 million, or 8.8%, from the comparable period in 2021. Our gross profit margin for 2022 was 35.8%, a decrease of 370 basis points from 39.5% in 2021. The decline was driven by the margin dilutive impact of pricing actions taken in response to the inflationary cost environment of approximately 240 basis points, increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs, higher conversion costs and a less favorable product mix both within and between our segments, each as compared to 2021. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by cost savings led by our CCI program. In addition, our gross profit for 2021 was burdened by (i) $6.3 million of transaction expense, representing the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the acquired inventories of Cholula and FONA upon our sale of those acquired inventories in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and (ii) a non-cash special charge of $4.7 million associated with the exit of a low margin business in our Asia/Pacific region. Excluding those transaction and integration expenses and special charges, adjusted gross profit margin declined 390 basis points to 35.8% in 2022 from 39.7% in 2021.

Percent of net sales 21.4 % 22.3 %

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $47.0 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. That decrease in SG&A expense was primarily a result of lower performance-based employee incentive expenses and variable selling costs, both as compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by (i) higher distribution costs; (ii) unfavorable investment results associated with non-qualified retirement plan assets; and (iii) higher investment associated with the implementation of our global enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform. SG&A as a percent of net sales for 2022 decreased by 90 basis points from the prior year level, due primarily to the net impact of the previously mentioned factors.

We regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time, those changes are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/ structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our Management Committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements.
During 2022, we recorded $51.6 million of special charges, consisting principally of (i) $23.3 million associated with the exit of our consumer business in Russia, (ii) $21.5 million associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in EMEA, and (iii) streamlining actions of $8.0 million in the Americas region, $7.1 million in the EMEA region, and (iv) $5.6 million associated with a U.S. voluntary retirement program. As more fully described in note 3 of our notes of consolidated financial statements, these charges were partially offset by a $13.6 million gain on the sale of our Kohinoor brand that was associated with the rice product line in India that we exited in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, as well as a reversal of $2.2 million of estimated costs associated with that rice product line exit upon settlement of a supply agreement related to that product line.
During 2021, we recorded $51.1 million of special charges, consisting principally of (i) $19.5 million associated with our exit of our rice product line in India (ii) $6.2 million associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in EMEA, (iii) streamlining actions of $10.3 million in the Americas region and $4.8 million in the EMEA region, and (iv) a non-cash asset impairment charge of $6.0 million associated with an administrative site that was sold in conjunction with our decision to employ a hybrid work environment.

During 2022, we recorded $2.2 million of integration expenses related to our acquisition of FONA. During 2021, we recorded transaction and integration expenses of $35.3 million related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. These costs consisted of (i) $6.3 million of amortization of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment of inventories that is included in Cost of goods sold, (ii) $13.8 million of other transaction expenses primarily related to outside advisory, service and consulting costs, and (iii) $15.2 million of integration expenses.

Special charges and transaction and integration expenses decreased by $32.6 million in 2022, as compared to 2021, and positively impacted operating income. Operating income as a percentage of net sales declined by 250 basis points in 2022, to 13.6% in 2022 from 16.1% in 2021 as a result of the factors previously described. Excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described, adjusted operating income was $917.4 million in 2022 as compared to $1,101.5 million in 2021, a decrease of $184.1 million or 16.7% from the 2021 level.

Interest expense was $12.5 million higher in 2022 as compared to the prior year as an increase in interest rates during the latter part of 2022 was partially offset by a decrease in average total borrowings. Other income, net for 2022 increased by $81.0 million, including the impact of a $49.6 million gain on the sale of our Kitchen Basics business and $18.7 million associated with the settlement of treasury lock arrangements, both of which are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying financial statements. The remaining increase was principally driven by an increase in interest income, as compared to the prior year.

Income from consolidated operations before income taxes $ 812.8 $ 895.8
Income tax expense 168.6 192.7
Effective tax rate 20.7 % 21.5 %

The provision for income taxes is based on the estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period. We record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of U.S. GAAP. Examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income include, but are not limited to, excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation, changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years, including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations, provision-to-return adjustments, the settlement of tax audits, changes in enacted tax rates, changes in the assessment of deferred tax valuation allowances, acquisition related deferred tax adjustments, and the tax effects of certain intra-entity asset transfers (other than inventory).
The effective tax rate was 20.7% in 2022 as compared to 21.5% in 2021. The decrease in our effective tax rate was principally attributable to the effects of the lower level of income before income taxes and the higher level of net discrete tax benefits in 2022 as compared to 2021. Net discrete tax benefits were $27.6 million in 2022, an increase of $1.0 million from $26.6 million in 2021. Discrete tax benefits in both the 2022 and 2021 periods included excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation ($9.1 million and $4.3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively), the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits ($6.9 million and $22.5 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively) due to, in 2021, the partial release of certain reserves for an unrecognized tax benefit and related interest in a non-U.S. jurisdiction based on a change in our assessment of the technical merits of that position associated with the availability of new information, and in both years due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations, the release of valuation allowances due to a change in judgment about realizability of deferred tax assets ($4.6 million and $4.4 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively), tax benefits related to the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from enacted legislation ($3.9 million and $4.0 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively), and other discrete items. In 2022, other discrete tax items included $2.3 million of tax benefits related to the sale of an asset associated with a previously exited line of business. In 2021, other discrete tax items included $10.4 million of deferred state tax expense directly related to our December 2020 acquisition of FONA.

Income from unconsolidated operations, which is presented net of the elimination of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased $14.4 million in 2022 from the prior year. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures, including our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, that comprised 84% and 62% of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the after-tax gain of $13.4 million on the sale of an unconsolidated operation that occurred in 2021.
We reported diluted earnings per share of $2.52 in 2022, compared to $2.80 in 2021. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2021 to 2022.

Results of Operations—Segments
We measure the performance of our business segments based on operating income, excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions. See note 16 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segment measures as well as for a reconciliation by segment of operating income, excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions. In the following discussion, we refer to our previously described measure of segment profit as "]:
NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into the following reportable segments: *Digital Media--Our Digital Media segment provides products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share, engage with and collaborate on documents and creative content. Our customers include creative professionals, including photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers and game developers, communicators, including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers, and consumers. *Digital Experience--Our Digital Experience segment provides an integrated platform and set of applications and services that enable brands and businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists, developers and executives across the C-suite. *Publishing and Advertising--Our Publishing and Advertising segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities, including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web conferencing, document and forms platform, web application development, high-end printing and our Adobe Advertising Cl...

An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 5.4% compared to 2021 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 5.2% on a constant currency basis.
Segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment decreased by $89.9 million, or 30.3%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease in segment operating income was driven by increased commodity, transportation and conversion costs, as well as costs related to supply chain investments, which were partially offset by a higher level of sales, including pricing actions in response to the inflationary cost environment, and CCI-led cost savings, all as compared to the prior year. Segment operating margin for our flavor solutions segment decreased by 450

On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment decreased by 27.9% in 2022, as compared to 2021.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2021 COMPARED TO 2020

Net sales $ 6,317.9 $ 5,601.3
Percent growth 12.8 % 4.7 %

Volume and product mix 5.5 % 3.7 %
Pricing actions 0.8 % 1.6 %
Acquisitions 4.1 % — %
Foreign exchange 2.4 % (0.6) %

Sales for 2021 increased by 12.8% from 2020 and by 10.4% on a constant currency basis. That 12.8% sales increase was driven by higher sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. On a consolidated basis, higher volume and favorable product mix increased sales by 5.5% while pricing actions, which were primarily taken in the fourth quarter, added 0.8% to sales. That net volume increase and favorable mix was driven by continued levels of strong demand within our consumer segment, as the shift in consumer behavior toward at-home meal preparation, first seen in 2020 as a response to actions taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, has persisted. In addition, our flavor solutions segment volume increased principally due to a recovery in demand for away-from-home products, including higher sales to our branded food service customers, as compared to 2020. Sales were also impacted by favorable foreign currency rates that increased net sales 2.4% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 10.4% on a constant currency basis.

Gross profit margin 39.5 % 41.1 %

In 2021, our gross profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 39.5% from 41.1% in 2020. The decline was driven by the impact of increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs, higher conversion costs, which includes costs associated with COVID-19, and a less favorable mix in sales between our consumer and flavor solutions segments as compared to 2020. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by savings from our CCI program, pricing actions, improved product mix and the accretive impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, each as compared to the prior year. In addition, our 2021 gross profit margin was burdened by (i) $6.3 million of transaction expense, representing the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the acquired inventories of Cholula and FONA upon our sale of those acquired inventories, and (ii) a non-cash special charge of $4.7 million associated with the exit of a low margin business in our Asia/Pacific region. Excluding the transaction expense and special charges, adjusted gross profit margin decreased by 140 basis points from 41.1% in 2020 to 39.7% for the year ended November 30, 2021.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $1,404.1 million in 2021 compared to $1,281.6 million in 2020, an increase of $122.5 million. That increase in SG&A expense was primarily a result of (i) SG&A associated with the Cholula and FONA acquisitions; (ii) greater selling and distribution expenses associated with the higher sales volume; and (iii) increased brand marketing costs, all as compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Those increases were partially offset by lower performance-based employee incentive expenses, as compared to the prior year. SG&A as a percent of net sales for 2021 decreased by 60 basis points from the prior year level, driven by the impact of the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher level of sales during the 2021 period.

We record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of U.S. GAAP.

The effective tax rate was 21.5% in 2021 as compared to 19.8% in 2020. The increase in our effective tax rate was principally attributable to the lower level of net discrete tax benefits in 2021 as compared to 2020. Net discrete tax benefits were $26.6 million in 2021, a decrease of $16.8 million from $43.4 million in 2020. Discrete tax benefits in both the 2021 and 2020 periods included excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation ($4.3 million and $14.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively), the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits ($22.5 million and $4.9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively) due to, in 2021, the partial release of certain reserves for an unrecognized tax benefit and related interest in a non-U.S. jurisdiction based on a change in our assessment of the technical merits of that position associated with the availability of new information, and in both years due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations, the release of valuation allowances due to a change in judgment about realizability of deferred tax assets ($4.4 million and $11.9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively) and other discrete items.

Income from unconsolidated operations $ 52.2 $ 40.8

Income from unconsolidated operations, which is presented net of the elimination of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, increased $11.4 million in 2021 from the prior year, driven by an after-tax gain of $13.4 million on the sale of our 26% interest in Eastern Condiments Private Ltd. (Eastern), an unconsolidated operation, during our second quarter of 2021, as more fully described in note 5 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures, including our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, that comprised 62% and 75% of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The relative impact of McCormick de Mexico on income from unconsolidated operations in 2021 was impacted by the gain on our sale of an unconsolidated operation.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

We will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest, to service debt, and to fund acquisitions. As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. Our primary obligations include principal and interest payments on our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt. In the next year, our most significant debt service obligation is the maturity of our $250.0 million, 3.50% notes due in September 2023. Also in July 2023, our $500 million, 364-day revolving credit facility matures. Detail on these contractual obligations follows:

(a)Interest payments include interest payments on long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings, principally consisting of commercial paper, have short-term maturities. We anticipate total interest expense for the year ending November 30, 2023 to approximate $200 million to $210 million, which we expect will also approximate cash interest payments for the same period. See note 6 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Our other cash requirements at year end include raw material purchases, lease payments, income taxes, and pension and postretirement benefits. We acquire various raw materials to satisfy our obligations to our customers, and these outstanding purchase obligations can fluctuate throughout the year based on our response to varying raw material cycles; however, these commitments generally do not extend past one year. In addition, we also have a series of commercial commitments, largely consisting of standby letters of credit. Our standby letters of credit, leases, and pension and other post retirement obligations are more fully described in notes 6, 7 and 11, respectively, of notes to our consolidated financial statements.
These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. To meet those cash requirements, we intend to use our existing cash, cash equivalents and internally generated funds, to borrow under our existing credit facilities or under other short-term borrowing facilities, and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular debt maturity or acquisition to our then-available sources of funds, to obtain additional short- and long-term financing. We believe that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our future cash requirements.
PENSION ASSETS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS – We hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. Cash contributions to pension plans, including unfunded plans, were $11.4 million in 2022, $15.0 million in 2021, and $11.9 million in 2020. It is expected that the 2023 total pension plan contributions will be approximately $13 million. Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent upon changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. We base our investment of plan assets, in part, on the duration of each plan’s liabilities. Across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans, approximately 55% of assets are invested in equities, 32% in fixed income investments and 13% in other investments. Assets associated with our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan are primarily invested in corporate-owned life insurance, the value of which approximates an investment mix of 60% in equities and 40% in fixed income investments. See note 11 of notes to our consolidated financial statements, which provides details on our pension funding.

(6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. The 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...
