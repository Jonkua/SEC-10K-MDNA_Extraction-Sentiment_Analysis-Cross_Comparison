Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
 of Operations

The information in this MD&A should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8, as well as the discussion included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All amounts and percentages are approximate due to rounding and all dollars are in millions, except per share amounts.

Business Overview and Reportable Segments
Sealed Air Corporation (“SEE”, “Sealed Air”, or the “Company”, also referred to as “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a leading global provider of packaging solutions integrating high-performance materials, automation, equipment and services. SEE designs and delivers packaging solutions that protect goods, preserve food, automate packaging processes, enable e-commerce and digital connectivity for packaged goods. Our packaging solutions are designed to help our customers automate their operations to be increasingly touchless and more resilient, safer, less wasteful, and enhance brand engagement with consumers. We deliver our packaging solutions to an array of end markets including fresh proteins, foods, fluids, medical and healthcare, e-commerce, logistics and omnichannel fulfillment operations, and industrials. Our portfolio of solutions includes leading brands such as CRYOVAC® brand food packaging, SEALED AIR® brand protective packaging, AUTOBAG® brand automated packaging, BUBBLE WRAP® brand packaging, SEE Automation™ solutions and prismiq™ smart packaging and digital printing.
The Company’s Food and Protective segments are considered reportable segments under FASB ASC Topic 280. Our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products and customers. Corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable segments. See Note 6, “Segments,” for additional information.
We employ sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a widespread distribution network, fabricators, converters, e-commerce and mail order fulfillment firms, and contract packaging firms as well as directly to end-users such as food processors, food service businesses, supermarket retailers, lodging, retail pharmaceutical companies, healthcare facilities, medical device manufacturers, and other manufacturers. We generally do not impose annual minimum purchase volume requirements on our distributors. Product returns from our distributors in 2022 were not material. In 2022, 2021 or 2020, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales.
On a consolidated basis, there normally is minimal seasonality in the business, with net sales historically being slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter. Our consolidated results of operations typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality. In 2022, however, the impact from supply disruptions through the first half of 2022 as well as increasing recessionary pressures and unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced during the second half of 2022, resulted in a lower portion of net sales in the second half compared to prior years. We expect that net sales and earnings in 2023, especially in the first half, may continue to be impacted by recessionary pressures. Approximately one-third of Food's sales are subject to formula based pricing, predominantly within North America and APAC, which lags raw material cost movement by approximately six months, on average. Additionally, changes in end-consumer behavior, such as an increase in e-commerce sales, or temporary social distancing restrictions due to COVID-19 or other factors, have in the past impacted the timing and seasonality of results of operations.
Cash flow from operations tends to be lower in the first quarter and higher in the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonality of sales and working capital changes, including the timing of certain annual incentive compensation payments. During 2022, the Company generated $400 million in cash flow from operations in the second half, compared to $213 million in the first half of 2022.
The extent and timing of our results of operations may be difficult to predict if significant one-time transactions, events or non-recurring charges were to impact our business.
Competition for most of our packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics, automation, sustainability-related characteristics of the materials, service, and price. Since competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology, we maintain ongoing research and development programs to enable us to maintain technological leadership. Competition is both global and regional in scope and includes numerous smaller, local competitors with limited product portfolios and geographic reach.
Our net sales are sensitive to developments in our customers’ business or market conditions, changes in the global economy, and the effects of foreign currency translation. Our costs can vary materially due to changes in input costs, including petrochemical-related costs (primarily resin costs), which are not within our control. Consequently, our management focuses on

36

reducing those costs that we can control and using petrochemical-based and other raw materials efficiently. We also believe that our global presence helps to mitigate the impact of localized changes in business conditions.
We manage our businesses with a strategic capital allocation mindset to create economic value. We are making investments to create value while generating operating cash flow that will permit us to continue to spend on innovative research and development and to invest in our business by means of capital expenditures for property, equipment and acquisitions. Moreover, we expect that our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow should provide us with the flexibility to repay debt and to return capital to our stockholders.
Each issue of our outstanding senior notes imposes limitations on our operations and those of specified subsidiaries. Our senior secured credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations on our indebtedness, liens, investments, restricted payments, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets, transactions with affiliates, amendment of documents and sale leasebacks, and a covenant specifying a maximum leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA. We expect continued compliance with our debt covenants including the covenant leverage ratio over the next 12 months. See Note 14, “Debt and Credit Facilities” for further details.

Non-U.S. GAAP Information
We present financial information that conforms to U.S. GAAP. We also present financial information that does not conform to U.S. GAAP, as our management believes it is useful to investors. In addition, non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are used by management to review and analyze our operating performance and, along with other data, as internal measures for setting annual budgets and forecasts, assessing financial performance, providing guidance and comparing our financial performance with our peers. Non-U.S. GAAP financial measures also provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the core operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses and/or gains (which may not occur in each period presented) and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and peers more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. Non-U.S. GAAP information does not purport to represent any similarly titled U.S. GAAP information and is not an indicator of our performance under U.S. GAAP. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Further, investors are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to arrive at these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, described below.
The non-U.S. GAAP financial metrics exclude certain specified items (“Special Items”), including restructuring charges and restructuring associated costs, adjustments in the valuation of our "SEE Ventures" portfolio (which may include debt or equity investments), and other charges related to acquisitions and divestitures, gains and losses related to acquisitions and divestitures, special tax items or tax benefits (collectively, “Tax Special Items”) and certain other items. We evaluate unusual or Special Items on an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an unusual or special item for purposes of determining our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including among other things (i) its nature, (ii) whether or not it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether or not we expect it to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
When we present non-U.S. GAAP forward-looking guidance, we do not also provide guidance for the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, as they are not available without unreasonable effort due to the high variability, complexity, and low visibility with respect to certain Special Items, including gains and losses on the disposition of businesses, the ultimate outcome of certain legal or tax proceedings, foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the volatile currency market in Argentina, and other unusual gains and losses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Earnings before Interest Expense, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, adjusted to exclude the impact of Special Items. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as one of many measures to assess the performance of the business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is the performance metric used by the Company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments. Adjusted EBITDA is also a metric used to determine performance in the Company's Annual Incentive Plan. We do not believe there are estimates underlying the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, other than those inherent in our U.S. GAAP results of operations, which would render the use and presentation of Adjusted EBITDA misleading. While the nature and amount of individual Special Items vary from period to period, we believe our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is applied consistently to all periods and, in conjunction with other U.S. GAAP and non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful and consistent comparison of our Company's performance to other periods.

The following table shows a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Net Earnings from continuing operations to non-U.S. GAAP Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations:

--------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- ------ ---- ------- ------ - -------
 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020
Net earnings from continuing operations $ 491.3 $ 491.2 $ 484.1
Interest expense, net 162.3 167.8 174.4
Income tax provision 238.0 225.0 142.1
Depreciation and amortization 236.8 232.2 216.5
Special Items:
Restructuring charges 12.1 14.5 11.0
Other restructuring associated costs 9.3 16.5 19.5
Foreign currency exchange loss due to highly inflationary economies 8.8 3.6 4.7
Loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities 11.2 18.6 —
Impairment loss/fair value (gain) on equity investments, net 30.6 (6.6) (15.1)
Impairment of debt investment — 8.0 —
Charges related to acquisition and divestiture activity 3.1 2.6 7.1

Gain on sale of Reflectix — (45.3) —

Other Special Items 6.7 3.5 6.8
Pre-tax impact of Special Items 81.8 15.4 34.0
Non-U.S. GAAP Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations $ 1,210.2 $ 1,131.6 $ 1,051.1

The Company may also assess performance using Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a useful measure to assess the profitability of sales made to third parties and the efficiency of our core operations.
Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share
Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (“Adjusted EPS”) are also used by the Company to measure total company performance. Adjusted Net Earnings is defined as U.S. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations excluding the impact of Special Items. Adjusted EPS is defined as our Adjusted Net Earnings divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding. We believe that Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted EPS are useful measurements of Company performance, along with other U.S. GAAP and non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, because they incorporate non-cash items of depreciation and amortization, including stock-based compensation, which impact the overall performance and net earnings of our business. Additionally, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted EPS reflect the impact of our Adjusted Tax Rate and interest expense on a net and per share basis. While the nature and amount of individual Special Items vary from period to period, we believe our calculation of Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted EPS is applied consistently to all periods and, in conjunction with other U.S. GAAP and non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted EPS provide a useful and consistent comparison of our Company's performance to other periods.
The following table shows a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings per Share from continuing operations to non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations.

(1)Includes pre-tax Special Items, plus/less Tax Special Items and the tax impact of Special Items as seen in the following calculation of non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted income tax rate.
Adjusted Tax Rate
We also present our adjusted income tax rate (“Adjusted Tax Rate”). The Adjusted Tax Rate is a measure of our U.S. GAAP effective tax rate, adjusted to exclude the tax impact from the Special Items that are excluded from our Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted EPS metrics as well as expense or benefit from any special taxes or Tax Special Items. The Adjusted Tax Rate is an indicator of the taxes on our core business. The tax circumstances and effective tax rate in the specific countries where the Special Items occur will determine the impact (positive or negative) to the Adjusted Tax Rate. While the nature and amount of Tax Special Items vary from period to period, we believe our calculation of the Adjusted Tax Rate is applied consistently to all periods and, in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP effective income tax rate, the Adjusted Tax Rate provides a useful and consistent comparison of the impact that tax expense has on our Company's performance.
The following table shows our calculation of the non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted income tax rate:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ------ ---- ----- ---- - - -----
 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2020
U.S. GAAP Earnings before income tax provision from continuing operations $ 729.3 $ 716.2 $ 626.2
Pre-tax impact of Special Items 81.8 15.4 34.0
Non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted Earnings before income tax provision from continuing operations $ 811.1 $ 731.6 $ 660.2

U.S. GAAP Income tax provision from continuing operations $ 238.0 $ 225.0 $ 142.1
Tax Special Items(1) (49.4) (31.9) 12.1
Tax impact of Special Items(2) 17.5 (2.3) 7.6
Non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted Income tax provision from continuing operations $ 206.1 $ 190.8 $ 161.8

U.S. GAAP Effective income tax rate 32.6 % 31.4 % 22.7 %
Non-U.S. GAAP Adjusted income tax rate 25.4 % 26.1 % 24.5 %

(1)For the year ended December 31, 2022, Tax Special Items primarily reflect accruals for unresolved controversy. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Tax Special Items consist primarily of accruals for unresolved controversy and revaluation of deferred tax assets for foreign legislation changes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Tax Special Items reflect net benefits from audit settlements and retroactive application of new GILTI regulations, offset by withholding expense related to cash repatriation initiatives.
(2)The tax rate used to calculate the tax impact of Special Items is based on the jurisdiction in which the item was recorded.

Organic and Constant Dollar Measures
In our “Net Sales by Geographic Region,” “Net Sales by Segment,” and in some of the discussions and tables that follow, we exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information, which we define as “constant dollar”, and we exclude acquisitions in the first year after closing, divestiture activity from the time of sale, and the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting net sales information, which we define as “organic.” Changes in net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and/or acquisition and divestiture activity are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. As a worldwide business, it is important that we consider the effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies. Nonetheless, we cannot control changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, when our management analyzes our financial results including performance metrics such as sales, cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expense, to measure the core performance of our business, we may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation by translating our current period results at prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We also may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations. As a result, our management believes that these presentations are useful internally and may be useful to investors.
Refer to these specific tables presented later in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for reconciliations of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
Free Cash Flow
In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures, as certain debt servicing requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted from this measure.
Refer to the specific tables presented later in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Analysis of Historical Cash Flow for reconciliations of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
Net Debt
In addition to total debt, we use Net Debt, which we define as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, as a useful measure of our total debt exposure. Net Debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, Net Debt should not be considered a substitute for amounts owed to creditors or other balance sheet information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Refer to the specific table presented later in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Outstanding Indebtedness for reconciliations of this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.

Executive Summary for 2022
Throughout 2022, we continued to focus on executing our strategies to drive growth through automation, digital, and sustainability solutions. Despite challenges, including the impact from supply chain and raw material disruptions, and recessionary pressures, SEE continued to work collaboratively across functions and countries. Net sales and operating profit grew in the current year, as we continued to deliver for our customers.
Automation - Since launching our SEE Automation Solutions strategy in 2020, we have experienced growth in equipment sales. We aim to solve our customers’ automation needs while creating significant return on their investments through savings and increased productivity. With SEE Automation, we are taking an integrated solutions approach and looking for opportunities to help customers eliminate waste, simplify processes, remove people from harm's way and drive 'touchless' operations.
Digital - The MySEE digital e-commerce platform is making doing business with SEE easier and more efficient. We are investing in automation and digital technologies that enhance performance, efficiency and monitoring in customers’ and our own operations. We are developing smart packaging that can enable traceability and deliver digital

40

content. We are investing in digital printing to drive customer savings, generate demand and enhance brand image and shelf impact.
Sustainability - Sustainability is embedded in our purpose and vision. We are designing high-performance packaging materials with recyclability in mind, to make sustainability more affordable, and to create a pathway for a circular economy.
We strive to deploy a purpose driven capital allocation strategy. As part of that strategy we invest and acquire to meet our strategic priorities. On February 2, 2022, SEE acquired Foxpak Flexibles Ltd. (“Foxpak”), a privately-owned Irish packaging solutions company. Foxpak is a digital printing pioneer that partners with brands to deliver highly decorated packaging solutions; stand-up and spout pouches, and sachets that serve a variety of markets including food retail, pet food, seafood, and snacks. This transaction resulted in a purchase price paid of approximately $10 million.
In addition to Foxpak, we continued to invest in disruptive technologies and innovations through our SEE Ventures initiative. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we invested an additional $11 million in strategic equity and debt instruments.
We continue to execute our Reinvent SEE business transformation, focused on the 4P'SSM: People + Digital, Performance, Platforms, Processes and Sustainability. During the year, the Reinvent SEE business transformation delivered incremental Adjusted EBITDA benefits of $27 million. The restructuring component of the Reinvent SEE business transformation has now concluded as of the end of calendar year 2022, but the capabilities, operational disciplines, and governance processes established through the Reinvent SEE business transformation are embedded in our on-going continuous improvement system and demonstrating sustained results. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately $21 million, or $17 million net of tax, in restructuring and restructuring associated charges primarily related to our Reinvent SEE business transformation initiatives. Cash payments, including restructuring payments, primarily related to our Reinvent SEE business transformation, were $22 million in 2022. See Note 12, “Restructuring Activities,” for additional details regarding the Company’s restructuring programs.
Supply Chain Disruptions and Raw Material Price Increases
Throughout 2022, the Company experienced supply chain disruptions such as limited availability of certain raw materials and equipment components. While we believe many of these shortages will continue to lessen moving forward, we cannot predict whether these supply disruptions would recur in the future. We also experienced inflationary pressures including sharp raw material price increases, higher freight costs and increases in other operating costs, including labor costs. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine also contributed to our current environment. Our Russian operation experienced raw material constraints in the first half of 2022. While these constraints have been largely resolved, we cannot predict whether these disruptions would recur in the future.
The Company implemented price increases throughout 2022 to offset inflationary pressures. As a result, we experienced an increase in gross margins (defined as the gross profit divided by net sales) during the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the prior year. For our formula-based pricing, which on average, lags raw material cost movement by approximately six months, we have not fully realized these margin increases. Approximately one-third of Food's sales are subject to formula-based pricing, predominantly within the Americas and APAC. Formula-based pricing does not comprise a significant portion of sales in our Protective segment.
We continue to work closely with our customers and have been leveraging our global supply network and supplier relationships and implementing material substitution where available to meet customers' demands and mitigate supply continuity risks. However, the current environment continues to negatively impact the price and supply of certain raw materials and equipment components. Additionally, the supply disruptions may result in longer lead times for some of our customers, the loss and/or delay of sales, or the inability to fulfill customer orders. Any of these developments may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for information concerning operational risks, including customer responses to price increases, raw material pricing and availability.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment and mitigation measures that have been put into place across the globe, have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the global economy and our business.
We continue to monitor the impact that COVID-19 has on all aspects of our business and geographies, including the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, business partners and distribution channels.

41

We and some of our customers have experienced facility shutdowns or reductions in operations during the pandemic. The outbreak of recent variants has adversely impacted staffing levels in our operations as affected employees recover from illness or contagious periods.
Our diverse end-markets and geographies continue to experience varying degrees of impact from COVID-19. The food service market, including restaurants, entertainment venues and hotels, experienced higher activity in 2022 as compared to the prior year when it was more adversely impacted by government mandated shut-downs and social distancing measures. This resulted in year-over-year volume growth for many of our products that support this market.
However, the environment remains volatile, and we cannot predict the future impacts of the pandemic on our business and the markets we serve. Government agencies may impose future restrictions on commercial activities to limit the spread of the virus, including new variants. During 2022, certain regions of China experienced an increase of COVID-19 cases and the resulting restrictions impacted our operations in China, including temporary shutdowns and production curtailments. Future developments of the pandemic, including future spikes or areas of significant regional spread, may cause uneven impacts to our geographies around the world.
The health and safety of SEE’s employees, suppliers and customers globally continues to be the Company’s top priority. At times during 2022, we had safety measures in place at our sites such as: enhanced cleaning procedures, employee temperature checks, use of personal protective equipment for location-dependent workers, social distancing measures within operating sites, and remote/flexible work arrangements for non-location dependent employees.
In remote working environments, we continue our efforts to mitigate information technology risks including failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyberattacks and security breaches of our networks or systems. Additionally, we continue to execute all activities related to our internal control over financial reporting in remote working environments. There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” above for additional risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Current Trends and Forward Looking Expectations
We expect overall demand for our solutions to be consistent with the prior year as we face a potential recessionary environment. We expect sales for our automated solutions and digital offerings, as well as sales through our online enterprise digital commerce channel, to continue to increase, as we execute on our growth strategies. We expect disciplines developed through our Reinvent SEE business transformation and initiatives under Reinvent SEE 2.0 to advance our on-going continuous improvement program, the SEE Operating Engine, driving operational efficiencies and benefits in 2023 and beyond.
We expect the supply chain disruptions and limited availability of certain raw materials that we experienced in 2022 to normalize during 2023. Overall, we expect continued inflation on labor, non-material costs, freight and raw material costs outside of commodity resins.
During 2022, some of SEE's materials or products became subject to a tax on certain plastics, which went into effect in the UK and the U.S. in 2022 and are planned to go into effect for additional European countries during 2023. While we have been able to successfully pass through the majority of the plastics tax thus far, there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover the full impact of plastic taxes from our customers as the plastic tax goes into effect for additional European countries in 2023. Not all of our products are subject to the tax, as the tax is dependent on various factors including, weight, gauge, material recyclability and recycled content, among other factors. Even if we are not successful in passing through future expense, we do not believe the impact of the plastic taxes would have a material impact on our results of operations. However, the impact of legislation or tax policies that may be amended or proposed and passed in the future is unknown. We maintain programs designed to comply with laws and regulations and to monitor their evolution.

Foreign Currency Translation Impact on Consolidated Financial Results
Since we are a U.S. domiciled company, we translate our foreign currency-denominated financial results into U.S. dollars. Due to the changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, translating our financial results from foreign currencies to U.S. dollars may result in a favorable or unfavorable impact. Historically, the most significant currencies that have impacted the translation of our consolidated financial results are the euro, the Australian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Chinese Renminbi, the Brazilian real and the New Zealand dollar.
The following table presents the approximate favorable or (unfavorable) impact that foreign currency translation had on certain components of our consolidated financial results:

Food
2022 compared with 2021
As reported, net sales increased $204 million, or 7%, in 2022 compared with 2021. Foreign currency had a negative impact of $135 million. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $339 million, or 11%, in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to the following:
•favorable pricing of $396 million, primarily reflecting price realization, with increases across all regions in response to the continued inflationary environment; and
•acquisition impact of $6 million.
These increases were partially offset by:
•lower volumes of $63 million, primarily due to food retail market declines across the Americas and EMEA regions and the adverse impact from prior supply disruptions.
2021 compared with 2020
As reported, net sales increased $287 million, or 10%, in 2021 compared with 2020. Foreign currency had a positive impact of $32 million. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $255 million, or 9%, in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to the following:
•favorable pricing of $142 million, primarily in the Americas, due to pricing actions and the impact of formula-based pricing to offset rising costs on inputs, non-material components, and labor; and

45

•higher volumes of $113 million, with increases across all regions, on higher demand in the food service industries and increased automated equipment sales.
Protective
2022 compared with 2021
As reported, net sales decreased $96 million, or 4%, in 2022 compared with 2021. Foreign currency had a negative impact of $89 million. On a constant dollar basis, net sales decreased $7 million, or less than 1%, in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to the following:
•lower volumes of $268 million, across all regions, primarily due to recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets and de-stocking throughout the value chain; and
•a decrease of $41 million due to the divestiture of Reflectix in November 2021.
These decreases were partially offset by:
•favorable pricing of $302 million, primarily reflecting price realization, with increases across all regions in response to the current inflationary environment.
2021 compared with 2020
As reported, net sales increased $343 million, or 17%, in 2021 compared with 2020. Foreign currency had a positive impact of approximately $36 million. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $308 million, or 15%, in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to the following:
•higher volumes of $161 million, with increases across all regions on higher industrial segment demand, strength in automated equipment and continued momentum in fulfillment; and
•favorable pricing of $154 million, primarily in the Americas, due to price actions to offset rising costs on inputs, non-material components, and labor.
These increases were partially offset by:
•a decrease of $7 million due to the divestiture of Reflectix in November 2021.

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

------------------- ----------------------- ------- -------- ------- ---- ------- ------------- - ------------- ------- - ---- - ---- -
 Year Ended December 31, % Change
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020

Cost of sales 3,869.0 3,852.9 3,293.9 0.4 % 17.0 %
As a % of net sales 68.6 % 69.6 % 67.2 %

2022 compared with 2021
As reported, cost of sales increased by $16 million, or 0.4%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. Cost of sales was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $166 million. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales decreased by 100 basis points, from 69.6% in 2021 to 68.6% in 2022, primarily driven by pricing realization. Improvements were partially offset by raw materials price increases and other inflationary non-material and labor cost increases.
2021 compared with 2020
As reported, cost of sales increased by $559 million, or 17.0%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. Cost of sales was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $49 million. As a percentage of net sales, cost of sales increased by 240 basis points, from 67.2% in 2020 to 69.6% in 2021, primarily due to higher input costs resulting from raw material price increases and higher freight costs associated with global supply chain disruptions. Additionally, labor inflation negatively impacted cost

46

of sales. Higher input, labor and freight costs were partially offset by productivity improvements resulting from our Reinvent SEE business transformation initiatives and the benefit of higher volumes on fixed cost components.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are included in the table below.

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- -------- ---- ---- ----- ------------- - ------------- ----- --- - ----- -
 Year Ended December 31, % Change
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020
Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 786.2 $ 772.4 $ 773.7 1.8 % (0.2) %

As a % of net sales 13.9 % 14.0 % 15.8 %

2022 compared with 2021
As reported, SG&A expenses increased $14 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. SG&A expenses were impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $23 million. On a constant dollar basis, SG&A expenses increased $37 million, or 5%. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily the result of inflation on labor costs, investment spend in the business to drive future growth, higher expenses associated with acquisition and divestiture activity, and higher credit losses, primarily from one North American customer, partially offset by favorable productivity benefits.
2021 compared with 2020
As reported, SG&A expenses decreased $1 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. SG&A expenses were impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $9 million. On a constant dollar basis, SG&A expenses decreased approximately $10 million, or 1%. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily the result of lower cash-based incentive compensation expense due to the achieved payout relative to the prior year and benefits from actions associated with our Reinvent SEE business transformation. Additionally, one-time or non-recurring items charged to SG&A were lower in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to lower expenses associated with acquisition and divestiture activity and lower restructuring associated items in support of our Reinvent SEE business transformation. Lower expenses resulting from these items were partially offset by labor inflation.
Amortization Expense of Intangible Assets
Amortization expense of intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

----------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---- -------- --- ---- ---- ------------- - ------------- ---- ----- - --- -
 Year Ended December 31, % Change
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020
Amortization expense of intangible assets $ 36.1 $ 38.8 $ 37.5 (7.0) % 3.5 %

As a % of net sales 0.6 % 0.7 % 0.8 %

The decrease in amortization expense of intangibles in 2022 was primarily due to lower amortization of capitalized software.
The increase in amortization expense of intangibles in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in amortization for capitalized software.

Reinvent SEE Business Transformation and Restructuring Activities
See Note 12, “Restructuring Activities,” for additional details regarding the Company’s restructuring activities as discussed below.
In December 2018, the Sealed Air Board of Directors approved a three-year restructuring program (the "Program") related to the Reinvent SEE business transformation. The Board of Directors later extended the Program to the end of calendar year 2022. The Program has now concluded as of the end of 2022.

47

We expect the continuous improvement capabilities and governance processes established through Reinvent SEE will continue to transform the SEE Operating Engine, which is rooted in economic value add with the goal to drive profitable, above market organic growth and attractive returns on invested capital.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Program generated incremental cost benefits of $27 million, related to reductions in operating costs.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Program generated incremental cost benefits of $60 million related to reductions in operating costs, of which $19 million was related to restructuring actions, and $4 million was related to actions impacting net price realization.
The decrease in cost benefits generated by the Program in 2022, as compared to 2021, was primarily driven by the adverse impact from supply disruptions resulting in lower cost efficiency due to raw material and labor availability in our operations.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred restructuring other associated expenses of $9 million, which were primarily related to third party fees in support of the Reinvent SEE business transformation and site consolidation costs. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded restructuring expense of $12 million.
Cash outlay for restructuring and restructuring related activities was $22 million and $28 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We expect cash outlay for restructuring and restructuring associated costs to be approximately $15 million during the year ending December 31, 2023.
The actual timing of future cash payments related to the Program described above are subject to change due to a variety of factors that may cause a portion of the payments to occur later than expected.

Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net includes the interest expense on our outstanding debt, as well as the net impact of capitalized interest, interest income, the effects of terminated interest rate swaps and the amortization of capitalized senior debt issuance costs and credit facility fees, bond discounts, and terminated treasury locks.
Interest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:

(1)In September 2021, Sealed Air issued $600 million of 1.573% Senior Secured Notes due 2026. The proceeds were used to retire the Company's 4.875% Senior Notes due 2022 and to repay the U.S. dollar tranche of Term Loan A due 2023. See Note 14, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for further details.
(2)On March 25, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, and the other financial institutions party thereto, which extended the maturity of the Term Loan A facilities and revolving credit commitment to March 2027. See Note 14, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for further details.
(3)On April 19, 2022, the Company issued $425 million of 5.000% senior notes due April 2029. The proceeds were used to repurchase the Company's 5.250% senior notes due April 2023. See Note 14, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for further details.

Impairment (loss)/fair value gain on equity investments, net
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a net loss of $31 million, a fair value gain of $7 million, and a fair value gain of $15 million, respectively, related to SEE Ventures equity investments. The 2022 net loss on equity investments of $31 million was due to a $32 million impairment loss partially offset by a $1 million fair value gain. See Note 16, "Fair Value Measurements, Equity Investments and Other Financial Instruments," for further details.
Loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities
In 2022, Sealed Air issued $425 million of 5.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2029. The proceeds were used to repurchase the Company's 5.250% Senior Notes due 2023. We recognized a pre-tax loss of approximately $11 million on such repurchase, primarily driven by the tender offer consideration beyond the principal amount of the notes tendered. In addition, the Company entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement during 2022 and, as a result, recognized a pre-tax loss of approximately $1 million. See Note 14, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for further details.
In 2021, Sealed Air issued $600 million of 1.573% Senior Secured Notes due 2026. A portion of the proceeds were used to repurchase the Company's 4.875% Senior Notes due 2022. We recognized a $19 million pre-tax loss on such repurchase, primarily driven by the tender offer consideration beyond the principal amount of the notes tendered. See Note 14, "Debt and Credit Facilities," for further details.
Impairment of debt investment
During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021, SEE recorded a credit loss resulting in an $8 million impairment of a convertible debt investment.
Brazil Tax Credits
Certain of our subsidiaries in Brazil received a decision from the Brazilian court regarding a claim in which SEE contended that certain indirect taxes paid were calculated on an incorrect amount. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company filed a return claim for the tax years of 2015 through 2018, resulting from a lower court decision regarding the matter.
In 2021, the Supreme Court of Brazil issued a final decision that clarified the methodology companies should use in the indirect tax recovery calculation. This decision was published and certified by the courts during the third quarter of 2021. As a result of the court's actions, the Company recognized a benefit of $5 million in 2021 primarily related to recovery for tax years not previously claimed. The claims related to indirect taxes will be used to offset future Brazilian tax liabilities.
As a result of this activity, the Company has been utilizing credits on indirect and direct tax payments.
See Note 23, “Other (Expense) Income, net,” for the components of other (expense) income, net.

Income Taxes
The table below shows our effective income tax rate (“ETR”).

49

---------- ------------------ -
Year Ended Effective Tax Rate
 2022 32.6 %
 2021 31.4 %
 2020 22.7 %

Our ETR for the year ended December 31, 2022 was 32.6%. The difference between the Company's ETR and the U.S. statutory rate of 21% related primarily to an increase in unrecognized tax benefits, state income tax expense, and foreign earnings subject to higher tax rates, partially offset by the benefit of tax credits and equity compensation.
Our ETR for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 31.4%. The difference between the Company's ETR and the U.S. statutory rate of 21% related primarily to state income tax expense, foreign earnings subject to higher tax rates, an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and legislative and administrative changes to enacted statutes, partially offset by the benefit of research credits.
Our ETR for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 22.7%. The difference between the Company's ETR and the U.S. statutory rate of 21% related primarily to state income tax expense and foreign earnings subject to higher tax rates, partially offset by the benefit from GILTI regulations issued by the IRS in 2020, research credits, and a reduction in valuation allowance due to increased profitability in EMEA.
Our ETR depends upon the realization of our net deferred tax assets. We have deferred tax assets related to accruals not yet deductible for tax purposes, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, employee benefit items, intangible assets and other items.
The IRS completed its field examination of our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2011 through 2014 in the third quarter of 2020. As previously disclosed, the IRS has proposed to disallow for the 2014 taxable year the entirety of the deduction of the approximately $1.49 billion in settlement payments made pursuant to the Settlement agreement (as defined in Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies”) and the resulting reduction of our U.S. federal tax liability by approximately $525 million. The proposed disallowance is being reviewed by the IRS Independent Office of Appeals (“Appeals”). Although we believe we have meritorious defenses to the proposed disallowance, we have reached a tentative agreement to settle this matter with the IRS, which is subject to further review, approval and execution of a definitive agreement by both parties. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed and we cannot predict the outcome of this matter or when it will be concluded. We have revised our uncertain tax position to reflect the tentative agreement. Future developments in this matter could have a material impact on the Company's uncertain tax position balances and results of operations, including cash flows, within the next twelve months.
We have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences, the future income from existing temporary differences, and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Conversely, if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances, we may be able to reduce those valuation allowances. We reported a net decrease in our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $10 million, primarily related to foreign exchange revaluation on foreign net operating losses. See Note 19, “Income Taxes,” for additional information.
We reported a net expense for unrecognized tax benefits in the year ended December 31, 2022 of $65 million, primarily related to amounts in North America. Interest and penalties on tax assessments are included in Income tax provision on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations
Net earnings from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are included in the table below.

For 2022, net earnings were unfavorably impacted by $114 million of Special Items after tax. Special Items were primarily comprised of:
•$49 million of Tax Special Items related primarily to increases in uncertain tax positions;
•$31 million ($23 million net of taxes) net loss on equity investments;
•$21 million ($17 million net of taxes) of restructuring and other restructuring associated costs in support of the Reinvent SEE business transformation; and
•$11 million ($8 million net of taxes) loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities.
For 2021, net earnings were unfavorably impacted by $50 million of Special Items after tax, which were primarily due to:
•Tax Special Items of $32 million, consisting of interest and other adjustments to existing unrecognized tax positions and deferred tax revaluations associated with legislative changes and administrative interpretations to enacted statutes;
•restructuring and other restructuring associated costs of $31 million ($23 million net of taxes);
•loss on debt redemption of $19 million ($14 million net of taxes); and
•impairment of debt investment of $8 million ($6 million net of taxes).
These expenses were partially offset by:
•a gain on sale of Reflectix of $45 million ($28 million net of taxes); and
•an increase in the fair value of equity investments of $7 million ($5 million net of taxes).
For 2020, net earnings were unfavorably impacted by $14 million of Special Items after tax, which were primarily the result of:
•restructuring and other restructuring associated costs primarily related to our Reinvent SEE business transformation of $31 million ($23 million net of taxes); and
•charges related to acquisition integrations and divestiture activities of $7 million ($5 million net of taxes).
These expenses were partially offset by:
•an increase in the fair value of equity investments of $15 million ($11 million net of taxes); and
•Tax Special Items of $12 million, primarily due to benefits from audit settlements and retroactive application of the new GILTI regulations.
Gain on Sale of Discontinued Operations, net of tax
Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

--------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --- ---- ---- ---- - ----
 Year Ended December 31,
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020
Gain on sale of discontinued operations, net of tax $ 0.3 $ 15.6 $ 18.8

On March 25, 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Diversey Care division and the food hygiene and cleaning business within our Food Care division (collectively, "Diversey") for gross proceeds of $3.2 billion. The transaction was completed on September 6, 2017. The sale of Diversey qualified as discontinued operations.
During 2022, we recorded a net gain of less than $1 million on the sale of discontinued operations. The gain relates primarily to the expiration of statutes on Diversey tax-related indemnification liabilities.
During 2021, we recorded a net gain of $16 million on the sale of discontinued operations. The gain relates primarily to the expiration of statutes on Diversey tax-related indemnification liabilities and tax benefit associated with the remaining tax indemnification liabilities.
During 2020, we recorded a net gain of $19 million on the sale of discontinued operations. The gain primarily relates to changes in balance sheet positions associated with the settlement and release reached with Diversey related to a clawback claim connected with the sale of the business.

Adjusted EBITDA by Segment

51

The Company evaluates performance of the reportable segments based on the results of each segment. The performance metric used by the Company's chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments is Segment Adjusted EBITDA. We allocate and disclose depreciation and amortization expense to our segments, although depreciation and amortization are not included in the segment performance metric Segment Adjusted EBITDA. We also allocate and disclose restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets by segment, although these items are not included in the segment performance metric Segment Adjusted EBITDA since restructuring and other charges and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets are categorized as Special Items. The accounting policies of the reportable segments and Corporate are the same as those applied to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
See “Non-U.S. GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net earnings from continuing operations to non-U.S. GAAP Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations.

Food
2022 compared with 2021
On a reported basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $67 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $23 million. On a constant dollar basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $90 million, or 13%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the impact of:
•favorable net price realization (which includes price realization less inflation on direct material, non-material and labor costs) of $113 million.
This increase was partially offset by:
•lower volumes of $15 million, primarily due to food retail market declines and the adverse impact from prior supply disruptions; and
•higher operating costs of $8 million, including increased costs in our operations associated with supply disruptions, and investment spend in the business to drive future growth, including higher travel and entertainment expenses, partially offset by productivity improvements.
2021 compared with 2020
On a reported basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $41 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $6 million. On a constant dollar basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased approximately $34 million, or 5%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to the impact of:
•Reinvent SEE benefits of $50 million driven by actions reducing operating costs by $48 million, including restructuring savings of $9 million, and improvements to net price realization of $2 million;
•higher volumes and favorable product mix of $47 million due to strength in automated equipment sales and higher food service demand; and
•lower operating costs of $19 million, primarily due to incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of supply chain disruptions.
These increases were partially offset by:
•higher input costs resulting in unfavorable net price realization of $82 million.

52

Protective
2022 compared with 2021
On a reported basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $19 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $17 million. On a constant dollar basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $36 million, or 8%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the impact of:
•favorable net price realization of $140 million.
This increase was partially offset by:
•lower volumes of $93 million, primarily due to recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets and de-stocking throughout the value chain;
•divestiture impact of $6 million; and
•higher operating costs of $5 million, due to increased investment spend in the business to drive future growth, including higher travel and entertainment expenses.
2021 compared with 2020
On a reported basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $38 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $7 million. On a constant dollar basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $31 million, or 8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to the impact of:
•higher volumes of $62 million on strength in fulfillment, higher industrial segment demand and increased automated equipment sales; and
•Reinvent SEE benefits of $14 million, driven by actions reducing operating costs, including restructuring savings of $10 million, and improvements to net price realization of $2 million.
These increases were partially offset by:
•unfavorable net price realization of $27 million; and
•higher operating costs of $18 million, primarily due to other costs associated with supply chain disruptions.
Corporate
2022 compared with 2021
Corporate Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $8 million on an as reported basis as compared to 2021, primarily driven by foreign currency losses, lower pension income and higher bank fee expenses in 2022.
2021 compared with 2020
Corporate Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million on an as reported basis and constant dollar basis as compared to 2020, primarily driven by an increase in non-operating income on closed defined benefit plans which are not attributable to either reporting segment.

Material Commitments and Contingencies
Settlement Agreement Tax Deduction
The information set forth in Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies,” under the caption “Settlement Agreement Tax Deduction” is incorporated herein by reference.

Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations primarily consist of short-term borrowings, principal and interest payments on long-term debt, operating and financing leases, dividend payments, compensation and benefit related obligations, including defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, and other contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business.

53

SEE has other principal contractual obligations which include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services, including energy, assumed in the normal course of business. These obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. We may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and, as a result use additional cash. See Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes for additional information.

Liability for Unrecognized Tax Benefits
At December 31, 2022, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $465 million of which we have reclassified $201 million to other current liabilities for the amounts expected to settle in 2023. See Note 19, “Income Taxes,” for further discussion.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have reviewed our off-balance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements have a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Income Tax Payments
We expect tax payments on our operations to be approximately $240 million to $250 million in 2023. Future payments are uncertain and dependent on a number of factors including the amount of future taxable income. The results of on-going appeals or audits by various taxing authorities, including the IRS, could increase our tax payments.

Interest Payments
Estimated future interest payments on the Company’s senior notes and senior secured credit facility through fiscal 2033 are expected to be $1,211 million, including $233 million expected in 2023, based on interest rates at December 31, 2022 and estimated incremental interest associated with the 2023 financing activities related to the Liquibox acquisition.
Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans
We maintain defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans for some of our U.S. and our non-U.S. employees. We currently expect our contributions to these plans to be approximately $4 million in 2023. Additionally, we expect benefits related to these plans paid directly by the Company to be $9 million in 2023. Future contributions and benefits paid directly by the Company are uncertain and rely on a number of factors including performance of underlying assets, future cash out flows of the plans, actuarial assumptions and funding discussions with boards charged with governance for some of our international plans. Refer to Note 17, “Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans,” and Note 18, “Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans,” for additional information related to these plans.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, we adjust the recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.
Indemnification obligations

54

We are a party to many contracts containing guarantees and indemnification obligations. These contracts include indemnities in connection with the sale of businesses, primarily related to the sale of Diversey in 2017. Because of the conditional nature of these obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement, we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential maximum exposure associated with these items.
Capital Expenditures
We expect payments for capital expenditures to be approximately $260 million to $280 million in 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Principal Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our senior secured credit facility, and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, stock repurchases, dividends, debt obligations, restructuring expenses and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above, in the next twelve months.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $456 million, of which approximately $347 million, or 76%, was located outside of the U.S. We believe our U.S. cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to U.S. borrowers are sufficient to fund our U.S. operating requirements and capital expenditures, current debt obligations and dividends. The Company does not expect that, in the near term, cash located outside of the U.S. will be needed to satisfy our obligations, dividends and other demands for cash in the U.S. Of the cash balances located outside of the U.S., approximately $12 million are in the Company's subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine. We have no other material cash balances deemed to be trapped as of December 31, 2022.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The following table summarizes our accumulated cash and cash equivalents:

------------------------- ------------ ----- ---- - -----
 December 31,
(In millions) 2022 2021
Cash and cash equivalents $ 456.1 $ 561.0

See “Analysis of Historical Cash Flow” below.
Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs
At December 31, 2022, we had $135 million available to us and no outstanding borrowings under our U.S. and European accounts receivable securitization programs. At December 31, 2021, we had $141 million available to us and no outstanding borrowings under the programs.
Our trade receivable securitization programs represent borrowings secured by outstanding customer receivables. Therefore, the use and repayment of borrowings under such programs are classified as financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We do not recognize the cash flow within operating activities until the underlying invoices have been paid by our customer. The trade receivables that served as collateral for these borrowings are reclassified from Trade receivables, net to Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 10, “Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs” for further details.
Accounts Receivable Factoring Agreements
We account for our participation in our customers' supply chain financing arrangements and our trade receivable factoring program in accordance with ASC Topic 860, "Transfers and Servicing" ("ASC Topic 860"), which allows the ownership transfer of accounts receivable to qualify for sale treatment when the appropriate criteria are met. As such, the Company excludes the balances sold under such programs from Trade receivables, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognize

55

cash flow from operating activities at the point the receivables are sold under such programs. See Note 11, “Accounts Receivable Factoring Agreements” for further details.
Gross amounts received under these programs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $659 million, of which $161 million was received in the fourth quarter. Gross amounts received under these programs for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $687 million, of which $207 million was received in the fourth quarter. If these programs had not been in effect for the year ended December 31, 2022, we would have been required to collect the invoice amounts directly from the relevant customers in accordance with the agreed payment terms. Approximately $108 million in incremental trade receivables would have been outstanding at December 31, 2022 if collection on such invoice amounts were made directly from our customers on the invoice due date and not through our customers' supply chain financing arrangements or our factoring program.
The decrease in gross amounts factored under these programs from 2021 to 2022 primarily relates to lower utilization of a certain customers' supply chain financing arrangement during 2022 and a customer supply chain financing arrangement that was used throughout 2021 but was exited by the customer during the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by the increased use of our trade receivable factoring program.
Lines of Credit
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had a $1 billion revolving credit facility program, with $985 million available as part of our senior secured credit facility. We had no outstanding borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2022 or 2021. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $7 million and $1 million, respectively, outstanding under various lines of credit extended to our subsidiaries. See Note 14, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for further details.
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) Phase Out
In July 2017, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced the phase out LIBOR. In March 2021, the FCA announced that specific U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors (overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month) will continue to be published until June 30, 2023, while the 1-week and 2-month tenors are no longer being published effective December 31, 2021. Similarly, all tenors for EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR currencies are no longer being published effective December 31, 2021. Regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions have worked to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in liquid and observable markets, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The phase-out of LIBOR did not have a material impact on our financing or liquidity. In March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2020-04. This ASU, along with subsequently issued ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2022-06, are designed to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform; however, neither the LIBOR phase-out nor these ASUs had a material impact on the Company.
SOFR
On March 25, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a fourth amended and restated syndicated facility agreement whereby its existing senior secured credit facility was amended and restated (the “Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) which converted the facilities rate from a LIBOR-based rate to a SOFR-based rate. See Note 14, "Debt and Credit Facilities" for further details.
Covenants
At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and limitations, as discussed in “Covenants” within Note 14, “Debt and Credit Facilities”, which require us, among other things, to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA of 4.50 to 1.00. At December 31, 2022, as calculated under the covenant, our leverage ratio was 2.46 to 1.00. We expect to be in continued compliance with all of our debt covenants including the covenant leverage ratio over the next 12 months.

Supply Chain Financing Programs
As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our working capital and improve our cash flow, we work with suppliers to optimize our purchasing terms and conditions, including extending payment terms. We also facilitate a voluntary supply chain financing program to provide some of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us (our accounts payables) to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. These programs are administered by participating financial institutions. Should a supplier choose to participate in the program, it will receive payment from the financial institution in advance of agreed payment terms; our responsibility is limited to making payments to the respective financial institutions on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier. The range of payment terms is

56

consistent regardless of a vendor's participation in the program. We monitor our days payable outstanding relative to our peers and industry trends in order to assess our conclusion that these programs continue to be trade payable programs and not indicative of borrowing arrangements. The liabilities continue to be presented as Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until they are paid, and they are reflected as Cash flows from operating activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows when settled.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our accounts payable balances included $140 million and $161 million, respectively, related to invoices from suppliers participating in the programs. The cumulative amounts settled through the supply chain financing programs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $463 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These programs did not significantly improve our cash provided by operating activities or free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

Debt Ratings
Our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. Below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency.

----------------------- ------------------------ ----------------
 Moody’s InvestorServices Standard& Poor’s
Corporate Rating Ba1 BB+
Senior Unsecured Rating Ba2 BB+
Senior Secured Rating Baa2 BBB-

Outlook Stable Stable

These credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade (with the exception of the Baa2 and BBB- Senior Secured Rating from Moody’s Investor Services and Standard & Poor’s, respectively, which are classified as investment grade). A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Outstanding Indebtedness
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our total debt outstanding and our non-U.S. GAAP net debt consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table.

--------------------------------------------- ------------ ------- ---- ------- - -------
 December 31,
(In millions) 2022 2021
Short-term borrowings $ 6.6 $ 1.3
Current portion of long-term debt 434.0 487.2
Total current debt 440.6 488.5
Total long-term debt, less current portion(1) 3,237.9 3,219.6
Total debt 3,678.5 3,708.1
Less: Cash and cash equivalents (456.1) (561.0)
Non-U.S. GAAP net debt $ 3,222.4 $ 3,147.1

(1)    Amounts are net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs of $19 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
See Note 14, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for further details.

Analysis of Historical Cash Flow
The following table shows the changes in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

57

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ------ ------- ---- ----- ------------- ------------- ------- ------- ------ - ------
 Year Ended December 31, Change
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 613.3 $ 709.7 $ 737.0 $ (96.4) $ (27.3)
Net cash used in investing activities (243.0) (125.7) (159.8) (117.3) 34.1
Net cash used in financing activities (446.7) (575.8) (261.7) 129.1 (314.1)
Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (28.5) 4.1 (29.2) (32.6) 33.3

In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures, as certain debt servicing requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted from this measure. We historically have generated the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year. Below are the details of non-U.S. GAAP free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ----- ------ ------- ---- ----- ------------- ------------- ------ ------ ------- - ------
 Year Ended December 31, Change
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020
Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 613.3 $ 709.7 $ 737.0 $ (96.4) $ (27.3)
Capital expenditures (237.3) (213.1) (181.1) (24.2) (32.0)
Non-U.S. GAAP free cash flow $ 376.0 $ 496.6 $ 555.9 $ (120.6) $ (59.3)

Operating Activities
2022 vs. 2021
Net cash provided by operating activities was $613 million during 2022, as compared to $710 million during 2021.
Net cash used by our working capital accounts (inventories, trade receivables, and accounts payable) was $178 million unfavorable during 2022, as compared to 2021. The impact of accounts payable on cash flow from operating activities was $278 million unfavorable compared to the prior year, as a result of lower balances due to a higher rate of raw material inflation and higher freight costs in 2021 as compared to 2022, coupled with a reduction in accounts payable balances in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to the moderation of purchasing activities tied to inventory reduction initiatives. Inventory was $13 million unfavorable to prior year due to stock build through the first three quarters of 2022 to mitigate global supply disruptions, raw material cost inflation, and lower sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2022. The unfavorable cash flow impact of accounts payable and inventory was partially offset by trade receivables, which generated approximately $113 million higher cash flow than the prior year. Trade receivables was favorable due to an increase in collections from our customers in 2022 as compared to prior year, as well as lower sales in the fourth quarter 2022 as compared to prior year.
Income taxes had a $59 million unfavorable indirect cash flow use of cash driven primarily by higher tax payments made in 2022 as compared to prior year.
This activity was partially offset by the increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions which had a $42 million favorable impact on an indirect basis. Incentive compensation had a $33 million favorable impact on operating cash flow. Specifically, incentive compensation cash payments made during the first quarter 2022 were approximately $25 million lower than those made in first quarter 2021. Additionally, on an indirect basis, the December 31, 2022 accrual for payout in the first quarter 2023 was approximately $8 million higher than the accrual at December 31, 2021. The higher accrual is due to achievement of

58

performance metrics in the respective years. Indirect taxes were also favorable by $25 million compared to the prior year driven by the timing of payments in 2022 as compared to the prior year.
2021 vs. 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities was $710 million during 2021, as compared to $737 million during 2020.
Net cash used by our working capital accounts (inventories, trade receivables, and accounts payable) was $74 million unfavorable during 2021, as compared to 2020. The impact of inventory on cash flow from operating activities was $141 million unfavorable compared to 2020, as a result of higher balances due primarily to raw material cost inflation, coupled with business growth and stock build to mitigate continued global supply chain disruptions. Trade receivables was $138 million unfavorable to 2020, due to the impact of higher sales and the year over year impact of our accounts receivable factoring program (2020 year over year increase was more significant than the 2021 increase). The unfavorable cash flow impact of inventory and trade receivables was partially offset by accounts payable, which generated $205 million higher cash flow than 2020. Accounts payable was favorable due to continued raw material price increases throughout 2021 compared to price decreases during 2020, as well as higher logistic and freight balances throughout 2021 due to global supply chain disruptions.
The impact of incentive compensation had a $46 million unfavorable impact on operating cash flow. Specifically, on an indirect basis, the December 31, 2021 accrual for payout in the first quarter 2022 was approximately $30 million lower than the accrual at December 31, 2020. The lower accrual is due to achievement of performance metrics in the respective years. Additionally, incentive compensation cash payments made during the first quarter 2021 were approximately $16 million higher than those made in first quarter 2020. Indirect taxes were unfavorable by $25 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of payments and business performance.
This activity was partially offset by a $46 million decrease in restructuring and restructuring associated payments made for our Reinvent SEE business transformation, as compared to 2020, as well as $77 million favorable indirect cash flow benefit for income taxes, year over year, driven by changes in the income tax receivable balance.
Investing Activities
2022 vs. 2021
Net cash used in investing activities was $243 million during 2022, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $126 million during 2021.
In 2022, SEE generated a total of $9 million from the sale of businesses and property and equipment primarily related to the disposal of land in the UK. Cash received from the sale of businesses and property equipment in 2021 was $89 million, primarily driven by the 2021 sale of Reflectix, Inc. which generated proceeds of $83 million.
Capital expenditures were $24 million higher during 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects the Company's continued investment in assets to support growth in our business.
During 2022, we invested a total of $20 million in the business under our SEE Ventures initiative, comprised of the following activity:
•$10 million for the acquisition of Foxpak, a digital printing pioneer that partners with brands to deliver highly decorated packaging solutions; stand-up and spout pouches, and sachets that serve a variety of markets including food retail, pet food, seafood, and snacks;
•$8 million made in the form of a convertible debt of an investee company focused on digital cutting and creasing systems;
•$1 million made in the form of a convertible debt of an investee company focused on developing digital advancements in packaging; and
•$1 million investment in a fund aimed to advance scalable recycling technologies, equipment upgrades and infrastructure solutions, which is being accounted for as an equity method investment.
The settlement of foreign currency forward contracts generated $5 million during 2022 as compared to $8 million in 2021. Additionally, Corporate Owned Life Insurance contracts generated $8 million during 2021, with no similar activity in 2022.
2021 vs. 2020

Net cash used in investing activities was $126 million during 2021, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $160 million during 2020.
In 2021, SEE generated a total of $89 million from the sale of businesses and property and equipment. This was primarily driven by the fourth quarter 2021 sale of Reflectix, Inc. which generated proceeds of $83 million. Cash received from the sale of businesses and property and equipment was $12 million in 2020.
Additionally, the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts generated $8 million during 2021 and Corporate Owned Life Insurance contracts generated $8 million during 2021. This compares to cash generation from foreign currency forward contracts of $2 million during 2020.
These investing cash sources were offset by investments in the business under our SEE Ventures initiative as well as higher capital expenditures.
Capital expenditures were $32 million higher during 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase reflects the Company's continued investment in assets which support growth coupled with lower spending in the prior year due to the impact of COVID-19.
During 2021, we invested a total of $18 million in SEE Ventures, comprised of the following activity:
•$9 million as an additional equity investment in a previously existing investee focused on e-commerce and fulfillment operations;
•$8 million made in the form of a convertible debt of an investee company focused on developing digital advancements in packaging; and
•$1 million investment in a fund aimed to advance scalable recycling technologies, equipment upgrades and infrastructure solutions, which is being accounted for as an equity method investment.
See Note 16, “Fair Value Measurements, Equity Investments and Other Financial Instruments,” for more information on our equity investments.
Investing activity in 2020 also included cash generation of $14 million from the maturity of cash deposits greater than 90 days (marketable securities), with no similar activity in 2021.
Financing Activities
2022 vs. 2021
Net cash used in financing activities was $447 million during 2022, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $576 million during 2021. The decrease in cash outflows for financing activities was primarily related to a decrease in share repurchases.
During 2022, the Company paid $280 million for share repurchases, compared to $403 million during in 2021.
Debt related activities were a cash use of $11 million during 2022, compared to a use of cash of $32 million during 2021. Cash activity in 2022 related to debt was primarily due to the early extinguishment of the 5.250% Senior Notes due 2023, resulting in a cash outflow of $440 million (including early payment premium of $10 million), partially offset by receipts from the issuance of $425 million 5.000% Senior Notes due 2029, net of $4 million in capitalized issuance costs. Cash activity in 2021 related to debt primarily related to receipts from the issuance of $600 million 1.573% Senior Secured Notes due 2026, net of $5 million in capitalized issuance costs. This was offset by the payment of $442 million related to the early extinguishment of the 4.875% Senior Note due 2022 (including early payment premium of $17 million), and $183 million in payments on the Company's Term Loan A, which includes the scheduled quarterly payments and the early repayment of $175 million in principal amount using the proceeds of the 1.573% Senior Secured Notes issuance.
Dividends paid of approximately $118 million in 2022 were $3 million higher than the prior year due to the increase in quarterly dividend announced in the second quarter 2021.
We continue to employ a purpose-driven capital allocation strategy to determine the best use of cash, including decisions regarding share repurchases, our debt-leverage ratio, acquisitions, and investments in growth and operational efficiency.
2021 vs. 2020

60

Net cash used in financing activities was $576 million during 2021, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $262 million during 2020. The increase in cash outflows for financing activities was primarily related to increased share repurchases, dividend payments and payments for debt extinguishment costs.
During 2021, the Company paid $403 million for share repurchases, compared to $33 million during in 2020.
Dividends paid of $116 million were $15 million higher than 2020 due to the increase in quarterly dividend announced in the second quarter 2021.
Debt related activities were a cash use of $32 million during 2021, compared to a use of cash of $105 million during 2020. Cash used for debt related activities during 2020 was primarily related to payment of the outstanding balance on the Company's revolving credit facility from 2019 utilization. Cash activity in 2021 related to debt primarily related to receipts from the issuance of $600 million 1.573% Senior Secured Notes due 2026, net of $5 million in capitalized issuance costs. This was offset by the payment of $442 million related to the early extinguishment of the 4.875% Senior Note due 2022 (including early payment premium of $17 million), and $183 million in payments on the Company's Term Loan A, which includes the scheduled quarterly payments and the early repayment of $175 million in principal amount using the proceeds of the 1.573% Senior Secured Notes issuance.

Changes in Working Capital

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------ ---- ---- --- ------ ---- - ------
 December 31,
(In millions) 2022 2021 Change
Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) $ 35.0 $ 62.3 $ (27.3)
Current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) 1.0 x 1.0 x
Quick ratio (current assets, less inventories divided by current liabilities) 0.6 x 0.7 x

The $27 million, or 44%, decrease in working capital was primarily due to the following:
•increase in other current liabilities of $212 million, primarily due to the reclass of uncertain tax positions to current liabilities as they are expected to be settled in cash within the next year; and
•$105 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents.
These decreases in working capital were partially offset by:
•increase in inventories, net of inventory reserves, of $141 million, primarily due to rising input costs and planned stock build as a result of supply disruptions;
•decrease in accounts payable of $94 million; and
•decrease in current portion of long-term debt of $53 million, primarily due to the refinancing of $475 million Term Loan A, which extended its maturity date to March 2027, partially offset by the reclassification of $426 million related to the Senior Notes due September 2023.

Changes in Stockholders’ Equity
The $95 million increase in stockholders’ equity in 2022 compared with 2021 was due to:
•net earnings of $492 million;
•the effect of share-based incentive compensation of $25 million, including the impact of share-based compensation expense and netting of shares to cover the employee tax withholding amounts;
•stock issued for profit sharing contribution paid in stock of $23 million;
•unrealized gains on derivative instruments of $21 million; and
•a net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss ("AOCL") of $11 million on unrecognized pension items due primarily to market conditions impacting actuarial assumptions as of our annual pension valuation date.
These increases were partially offset by:
•repurchases of 4.5 million shares of our common stock for $280 million, including commissions paid (See Note 21, “Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity” for further details);

61

•dividends paid on our common stock and dividend equivalent accruals related to unvested equity awards of $119 million; and
•Cumulative Translation Adjustment (“CTA”) loss of $77 million.

Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements
We are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards,” which is contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence, including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions, management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts. These sources include our officers and other employees, outside consultants and legal counsel, third-party experts and actuaries. In addition, we use internally generated reports and statistics, such as aging of trade receivables, as well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry reports and third-party research studies. The results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, and any such differences may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

62

We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards”.
Commitments and Contingencies — Litigation
On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we consider insurance recoveries, if any. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. We have historically adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or for which additional information has been provided on which to review the probability and measurability of outcomes, and will continue to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
For finite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships, contracts, and intellectual property, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are present, we perform a review for impairment. The impairment model is a two step test under which we first calculate the recoverability of the carrying value by comparing the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group, including its estimated residual value, to the carrying amount. If the cash flows associated with the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value, we would perform a fair value assessment of the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount is found to be greater than the fair value, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
For indefinite–lived intangible assets, such as trademarks and trade names, each year and whenever impairment indicators are present, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value, if any. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate. We recorded no impairment to indefinite lived assets in the current year.
Goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year. A review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable.
A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segment - the “component” level - discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit.
In our annual impairment review, we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In a qualitative assessment, we would consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general economic conditions, industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and regulatory and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation; and events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets.
If the results of our qualitative assessment indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we are required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine the fair value of the reporting unit.

63

Alternatively, if an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed, we may perform a quantitative assessment. Under the quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, there would be no indication of impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit were less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference.
Under the quantitative assessment, we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value. Fair value computed by these models is arrived at using a number of factors and inputs. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to fair value models, the inputs and our judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
We believe the most significant inputs while performing a quantitative assessments include:
•Forecasted future operating results: On an annual basis, the Company prepares annual and medium-term financial projections. These projections are based on input from the Company's leadership, strategy, commercial leadership and finance teams and presented to our Board of Directors annually.
•Discount rate: Our third-party valuation specialists provide inputs into management's determination of the discount rate. The rate is dependent on a number of underlying assumptions, the most impactful of which are the risk-free rate, tax rate, equity risk premium, debt to equity ratio and pre-tax cost of debt.
•Long-term growth rate: Long-term growth rates are applied to the terminal year of our cash flow valuation approach. The long-term growth rates are tied to growth rates we expect to achieve beyond the years for which we have forecasted operating results. We also consider external benchmarks, including forecasted long-term GDP growth and other data points which we believe are applicable to our industry and the composition of our global operations.
The Company performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of October 1, 2022. Based on our qualitative assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units sufficiently exceeds the carrying value. As part of our analysis, we performed a look back over the key assumptions impacting the quantitative test performed in 2020, including forecasted operating results and discount rates.
The Company also assesses its goodwill for impairment from time to time when warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding individual reporting units. Subsequent to our annual reporting period, we continued to assess whether there were changes in facts or circumstances that would lead us to believe goodwill may be impaired. No indication of goodwill impairment has been identified subsequent to our annual testing date.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment and in the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed quantitative assessment for our annual impairment test. No indication of goodwill impairment was identified in 2021 or 2020.
See Note 9, “Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets, net,” for details of our goodwill balances as of 2022, 2021 and 2020 and additional information related to the qualitative assessment performed in 2022.
Pensions
For a number of our current and former U.S. and international employees, we maintain defined benefit pension plans. Under current accounting standards, we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans.
The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third-party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a plan-by-plan basis each fiscal year. We believe the most significant assumptions are the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected future rate of return on plan assets. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life or expected life of eligible employees. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted-average expected return on our asset allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.

64

At December 31, 2022, the total projected benefit obligation for our U.S. pension plan was $140 million, and the total benefit income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3 million. At December 31, 2022, the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was $482 million, and the total benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1 million. The employer service cost of our pension plans is charged to Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses. All other components of benefits expense are recorded to Other (expense) income, net.
Material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs, and the value of assets or liabilities recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases (decreases) in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2022 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2023:

------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------- ----- ------------------------------------- - - ---

Return on Assets
Effect on 2023 expected net periodic benefit cost $ (4.4) $ 4.4

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company purchased a buy-in insurance contract which covered the remaining portion of the liability for one of our defined benefit pension plans in the UK. The total projected benefit obligation of the plan is $8 million. The projected benefit obligation was developed using actuarial assumptions that would be used in a plan termination or buy-out basis. Under a full buy-out, the liabilities are fully transferred to an insurance or annuity provider and SEE would no longer maintain the liability or administrative responsibilities. We expect this plan to move to full buy-out in 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the assets for this plan matched the projected benefit obligation and there was no material net balance sheet position for this plan recorded within our assets or liabilities. The plan has an accumulated comprehensive loss of $7 million ($5 million, net of tax), recorded within AOCL in Stockholders' Equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022. Upon plan termination or full buy-out, the accumulated comprehensive loss would be recognized to Other (expense) income, net within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Income Taxes
Estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences, carryforwards of tax losses, and tax credits. We provide a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
In assessing the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, we estimate future taxable earnings and consider the feasibility of ongoing planning strategies, the realizability of tax loss carryforwards, and past operating results to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings can have an impact on valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, we may need to adjust the valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In calculating our worldwide provision for income taxes, we also evaluate our tax positions for years where the statutes of limitations have not expired. Based on this review, we may establish a liability for additional taxes and interest that could be

65

assessed upon examination by relevant tax authorities. We adjust this liability to take into account changing facts and circumstances, including the results of tax audits and changes in tax law. If the payment of additional taxes and interest ultimately proves unnecessary or less than the amount of the liability, the reversal of the liability would result in tax benefit being recognized in the period when we determine the liability is no longer necessary. If an estimate of the tax liability proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to the income tax provision would result. These adjustments to liabilities and related expenses could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with tax authorities. See Note 19, “Income Taxes,” for further discussion.

EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.

Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...

NOTE 23: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental (including asbestos) and legal matters. In accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are generally based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the Company accrues the minimum amount. In addition, these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of the following matters based on the information currently available, except as otherwise noted. However, the Company does not believe that the resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the Company's competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Environmental Matters The Company's operations are subject to environmental regulation by various authorities. The Company has accrued for the costs of environmental remediation activities, including but not limited to, investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs and performance guarantees. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to individual sites, including the technology required to remediate, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the outstanding liability for environmental obligations are as follows: -------------------------------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- --- - --- (In millions) 2022 2021 Environmental reserves included in Accrued liabilities $ 24 $ 29 Environmental reserves included in Other long-term liabilities 211 191 Tot...

Note 19. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 129 68 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Kinder Morgan, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kinder Morgan, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to ex...

NOTE 20. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for Aldrich and Murray and environmental and product liability matters. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company. Asbestos-Related Matters Certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies of the Company have been named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims were filed against predecessors of Aldrich and Murray and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by predecessors of Aldrich or Murray, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of the Company's existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. On June 18, 2020, Aldrich and Murray filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants and to Aldrich and Murray. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to th...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...

Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...

The information in this MD&A should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes set forth in Part II, Item 8, as well as the discussion included in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Business Overview and Reportable Segments
Sealed Air Corporation (“SEE”, “Sealed Air”, or the “Company”, also referred to as “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a leading global provider of packaging solutions integrating high-performance materials, automation, equipment and services. SEE designs and delivers packaging solutions that protect goods, preserve food, automate packaging processes, enable e-commerce and digital connectivity for packaged goods. Our packaging solutions are designed to help our customers automate their operations to be increasingly touchless and more resilient, safer, less wasteful, and enhance brand engagement with consumers. We deliver our packaging solutions to an array of end markets including fresh proteins, foods, fluids, medical and healthcare, e-commerce, logistics and omnichannel fulfillment operations, and industrials. Our portfolio of solutions includes leading brands such as CRYOVAC® brand food packaging, SEALED AIR® brand protective packaging, AUTOBAG® brand automated packaging, BUBBLE WRAP® brand packaging, SEE Automation™ solutions and prismiq™ smart packaging and digital printing.
The Company’s Food and Protective segments are considered reportable segments under FASB ASC Topic 280. Our reportable segments are aligned with similar groups of products and customers. Corporate includes certain costs that are not allocated to the reportable segments. See Note 6, “Segments,” for additional information.
We employ sales, marketing and customer service personnel throughout the world who sell and market our products to and through a widespread distribution network, fabricators, converters, e-commerce and mail order fulfillment firms, and contract packaging firms as well as directly to end-users such as food processors, food service businesses, supermarket retailers, lodging, retail pharmaceutical companies, healthcare facilities, medical device manufacturers, and other manufacturers. We generally do not impose annual minimum purchase volume requirements on our distributors. Product returns from our distributors in 2022 were not material. In 2022, 2021 or 2020, no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales.
On a consolidated basis, there normally is minimal seasonality in the business, with net sales historically being slightly lower in the first quarter and slightly higher towards the end of the third quarter through the fourth quarter. Our consolidated results of operations typically trend directionally the same as our net sales seasonality. In 2022, however, the impact from supply disruptions through the first half of 2022 as well as increasing recessionary pressures and unfavorable foreign currency translation experienced during the second half of 2022, resulted in a lower portion of net sales in the second half compared to prior years. We expect that net sales and earnings in 2023, especially in the first half, may continue to be impacted by recessionary pressures. Approximately one-third of Food']:
Note 8. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, net consists of the following (in millions): --------------------------------- ------------ ------ ---- -------- - ------ December 31, 2022 2021 Land $ 1,874 $ 1,688 Servers and network assets 34,330 25,584 Buildings 27,720 22,531 Leasehold improvements 6,522 5,795 Equipment and other 5,642 4,764 Finance lease right-of-use assets 3,353 2,840 Construction in progress 25,052 14,687 Property and equipment, gross 104,493 77,889 Less: Accumulated depreciation (24,975) (20,080) Property and equipment, net $ 79,518 $ 57,809 105  Construction in progress includes costs mostly related to construction of data centers, network infrastructure, servers, and office facilities. As of December 31, 2022, construction in progress also includes $2.18 billion of servers and network assets components stored by our suppliers until required by our design manufacturers to fulfill certain purchase orders. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $8.50 billion, $7.56 billion, and $6.39 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The majority of the property and equipment depreciation expense was from servers and network assets depreciation of $5.29 billion, $4.94 billion, and $4.38 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful life of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $1.34 billion abandonment charge and $508 million impairment loss for data center assets and leasehold improvements assets, respectively, as a result of our restructuring efforts. For additional information, see Note 3 -- Restructuring.

[' demands and mitigate supply continuity risks. However, the current environment continues to negatively impact the price and supply of certain raw materials and equipment components. Additionally, the supply disruptions may result in longer lead times for some of our customers, the loss and/or delay of sales, or the inability to fulfill customer orders. Any of these developments may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for information concerning operational risks, including customer responses to price increases, raw material pricing and availability.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment and mitigation measures that have been put into place across the globe, have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the global economy and our business.
We continue to monitor the impact that COVID-19 has on all aspects of our business and geographies, including the impact on our employees, customers, suppliers, business partners and distribution channels.

41

We and some of our customers have experienced facility shutdowns or reductions in operations during the pandemic. The outbreak of recent variants has adversely impacted staffing levels in our operations as affected employees recover from illness or contagious periods.
Our diverse end-markets and geographies continue to experience varying degrees of impact from COVID-19. The food service market, including restaurants, entertainment venues and hotels, experienced higher activity in 2022 as compared to the prior year when it was more adversely impacted by government mandated shut-downs and social distancing measures. This resulted in year-over-year volume growth for many of our products that support this market.
However, the environment remains volatile, and we cannot predict the future impacts of the pandemic on our business and the markets we serve. Government agencies may impose future restrictions on commercial activities to limit the spread of the virus, including new variants. During 2022, certain regions of China experienced an increase of COVID-19 cases and the resulting restrictions impacted our operations in China, including temporary shutdowns and production curtailments. Future developments of the pandemic, including future spikes or areas of significant regional spread, may cause uneven impacts to our geographies around the world.
The health and safety of SEE’s employees, suppliers and customers globally continues to be the Company’s top priority. At times during 2022, we had safety measures in place at our sites such as: enhanced cleaning procedures, employee temperature checks, use of personal protective equipment for location-dependent workers, social distancing measures within operating sites, and remote/flexible work arrangements for non-location dependent employees.
In remote working environments, we continue our efforts to mitigate information technology risks including failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyberattacks and security breaches of our networks or systems. Additionally, we continue to execute all activities related to our internal control over financial reporting in remote working environments. There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” above for additional risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Current Trends and Forward Looking Expectations
We expect overall demand for our solutions to be consistent with the prior year as we face a potential recessionary environment. We expect sales for our automated solutions and digital offerings, as well as sales through our online enterprise digital commerce channel, to continue to increase, as we execute on our growth strategies. We expect disciplines developed through our Reinvent SEE business transformation and initiatives under Reinvent SEE 2.0 to advance our on-going continuous improvement program, the SEE Operating Engine, driving operational efficiencies and benefits in 2023 and beyond.
We expect the supply chain disruptions and limited availability of certain raw materials that we experienced in 2022 to normalize during 2023. Overall, we expect continued inflation on labor, non-material costs, freight and raw material costs outside of commodity resins.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022.

Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently.

We have established valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets depends in part upon our ability to carryback any losses created by the deduction of these temporary differences, the future income from existing temporary differences, and the ability to generate future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions during the periods in which these temporary differences reverse. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Conversely, if we have sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions where we have valuation allowances, we may be able to reduce those valuation allowances. We reported a net decrease in our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $10 million, primarily related to foreign exchange revaluation on foreign net operating losses. See Note 19, “Income Taxes,” for additional information.
We reported a net expense for unrecognized tax benefits in the year ended December 31, 2022 of $65 million, primarily related to amounts in North America. Interest and penalties on tax assessments are included in Income tax provision on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

For 2022, net earnings were unfavorably impacted by $114 million of Special Items after tax. Special Items were primarily comprised of:
•$49 million of Tax Special Items related primarily to increases in uncertain tax positions;
•$31 million ($23 million net of taxes) net loss on equity investments;
•$21 million ($17 million net of taxes) of restructuring and other restructuring associated costs in support of the Reinvent SEE business transformation; and
•$11 million ($8 million net of taxes) loss on debt redemption and refinancing activities.
For 2021, net earnings were unfavorably impacted by $50 million of Special Items after tax, which were primarily due to:
•Tax Special Items of $32 million, consisting of interest and other adjustments to existing unrecognized tax positions and deferred tax revaluations associated with legislative changes and administrative interpretations to enacted statutes;
•restructuring and other restructuring associated costs of $31 million ($23 million net of taxes);
•loss on debt redemption of $19 million ($14 million net of taxes); and
•impairment of debt investment of $8 million ($6 million net of taxes).
These expenses were partially offset by:
•a gain on sale of Reflectix of $45 million ($28 million net of taxes); and
•an increase in the fair value of equity investments of $7 million ($5 million net of taxes).
For 2020, net earnings were unfavorably impacted by $14 million of Special Items after tax, which were primarily the result of:
•restructuring and other restructuring associated costs primarily related to our Reinvent SEE business transformation of $31 million ($23 million net of taxes); and
•charges related to acquisition integrations and divestiture activities of $7 million ($5 million net of taxes).
These expenses were partially offset by:
•an increase in the fair value of equity investments of $15 million ($11 million net of taxes); and
•Tax Special Items of $12 million, primarily due to benefits from audit settlements and retroactive application of the new GILTI regulations.

Recently Issued Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, Accounting Guidance and Disclosure Requirements
We are subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards, accounting guidance and disclosure requirements. Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards,” which is contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, describes these new accounting standards and is incorporated herein by reference.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Our estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on all available evidence, including historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. To derive these estimates and assumptions, management draws from those available sources that can best contribute to its efforts. These sources include our officers and other employees, outside consultants and legal counsel, third-party experts and actuaries. In addition, we use internally generated reports and statistics, such as aging of trade receivables, as well as outside sources such as government statistics, industry reports and third-party research studies. The results of these estimates and assumptions may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from estimates under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed, and any such differences may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

62

We believe the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our consolidated results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The critical accounting policies discussed below should be read together with our significant accounting policies set forth in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards”.
Commitments and Contingencies — Litigation
On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities and costs related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and when the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation proceedings are evaluated on a case-by-case basis considering the available information, including that received from internal and outside legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we consider insurance recoveries, if any. We expense legal costs, including those legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. We have historically adjusted existing accruals as proceedings have continued, been settled or for which additional information has been provided on which to review the probability and measurability of outcomes, and will continue to do so in future periods. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery, it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
For finite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships, contracts, and intellectual property, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are present, we perform a review for impairment. The impairment model is a two step test under which we first calculate the recoverability of the carrying value by comparing the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows associated with the asset or asset group, including its estimated residual value, to the carrying amount. If the cash flows associated with the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value, we would perform a fair value assessment of the asset, or asset group. If the carrying amount is found to be greater than the fair value, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over the fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.
For indefinite–lived intangible assets, such as trademarks and trade names, each year and whenever impairment indicators are present, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value, if any. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite–lived is appropriate. We recorded no impairment to indefinite lived assets in the current year.
Goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually on a reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each year. A review of goodwill may be initiated before or after conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable.
A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, at businesses one level below that operating segment - the “component” level - discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, and the component has economic characteristics that are different from the economic characteristics of the other components of the operating segment, in which case the component is the reporting unit.
In our annual impairment review, we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In a qualitative assessment, we would consider the macroeconomic conditions, including any deterioration of general economic conditions, industry and market conditions, including any deterioration in the environment where the reporting unit operates, increased competition, changes in the products/services and regulatory and political developments; cost of doing business; overall financial performance, including any declining cash flows and performance in relation to planned revenues and earnings in past periods; other relevant reporting unit specific facts, such as changes in management or key personnel or pending litigation; and events affecting the reporting unit, including changes in the carrying value of net assets.
If the results of our qualitative assessment indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we are required to perform a quantitative assessment to determine the fair value of the reporting unit.

63

Alternatively, if an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment is not performed, we may perform a quantitative assessment. Under the quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, there would be no indication of impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit were less than the carrying value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the difference.
Under the quantitative assessment, we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach and appropriate market approaches. Absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions, we believe that the use of these methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value. Fair value computed by these models is arrived at using a number of factors and inputs. There are inherent uncertainties, however, related to fair value models, the inputs and our judgment in applying them to this analysis. Nonetheless, we believe that the combination of these methods provides a reasonable approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.
We believe the most significant inputs while performing a quantitative assessments include:
•Forecasted future operating results: On an annual basis, the Company prepares annual and medium-term financial projections. These projections are based on input from the Company']:

['s determination of the discount rate. The rate is dependent on a number of underlying assumptions, the most impactful of which are the risk-free rate, tax rate, equity risk premium, debt to equity ratio and pre-tax cost of debt.
•Long-term growth rate: Long-term growth rates are applied to the terminal year of our cash flow valuation approach. The long-term growth rates are tied to growth rates we expect to achieve beyond the years for which we have forecasted operating results. We also consider external benchmarks, including forecasted long-term GDP growth and other data points which we believe are applicable to our industry and the composition of our global operations.
The Company performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill by reporting unit as of October 1, 2022. Based on our qualitative assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units sufficiently exceeds the carrying value. As part of our analysis, we performed a look back over the key assumptions impacting the quantitative test performed in 2020, including forecasted operating results and discount rates.
The Company also assesses its goodwill for impairment from time to time when warranted by the facts and circumstances surrounding individual reporting units. Subsequent to our annual reporting period, we continued to assess whether there were changes in facts or circumstances that would lead us to believe goodwill may be impaired. No indication of goodwill impairment has been identified subsequent to our annual testing date.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment and in the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed quantitative assessment for our annual impairment test. No indication of goodwill impairment was identified in 2021 or 2020.
See Note 9, “Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets, net,” for details of our goodwill balances as of 2022, 2021 and 2020 and additional information related to the qualitative assessment performed in 2022.
Pensions
For a number of our current and former U.S. and international employees, we maintain defined benefit pension plans. Under current accounting standards, we are required to make assumptions regarding the valuation of projected benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans.
The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third-party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a plan-by-plan basis each fiscal year. We believe the most significant assumptions are the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation and the expected future rate of return on plan assets. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.
In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life or expected life of eligible employees. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted-average expected return on our asset allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The measurement date used to determine the benefit obligation and plan assets is December 31.

64

At December 31, 2022, the total projected benefit obligation for our U.S. pension plan was $140 million, and the total benefit income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $3 million. At December 31, 2022, the total projected benefit obligation for our international pension plans was $482 million, and the total benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1 million. The employer service cost of our pension plans is charged to Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses. All other components of benefits expense are recorded to Other (expense) income, net.
Material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs, and the value of assets or liabilities recognized on our Consolidated Financial Statements. A 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and a 100 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in the following increases (decreases) in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2022 and the expected net periodic benefit cost for the year ending December 31, 2023:

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company purchased a buy-in insurance contract which covered the remaining portion of the liability for one of our defined benefit pension plans in the UK. The total projected benefit obligation of the plan is $8 million. The projected benefit obligation was developed using actuarial assumptions that would be used in a plan termination or buy-out basis. Under a full buy-out, the liabilities are fully transferred to an insurance or annuity provider and SEE would no longer maintain the liability or administrative responsibilities. We expect this plan to move to full buy-out in 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the assets for this plan matched the projected benefit obligation and there was no material net balance sheet position for this plan recorded within our assets or liabilities. The plan has an accumulated comprehensive loss of $7 million ($5 million, net of tax), recorded within AOCL in Stockholders']:

Food
2022 compared with 2021
On a reported basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $67 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $23 million. On a constant dollar basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $90 million, or 13%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the impact of:
•favorable net price realization (which includes price realization less inflation on direct material, non-material and labor costs) of $113 million.
This increase was partially offset by:
•lower volumes of $15 million, primarily due to food retail market declines and the adverse impact from prior supply disruptions; and
•higher operating costs of $8 million, including increased costs in our operations associated with supply disruptions, and investment spend in the business to drive future growth, including higher travel and entertainment expenses, partially offset by productivity improvements.
2021 compared with 2020
On a reported basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $41 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $6 million. On a constant dollar basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased approximately $34 million, or 5%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to the impact of:
•Reinvent SEE benefits of $50 million driven by actions reducing operating costs by $48 million, including restructuring savings of $9 million, and improvements to net price realization of $2 million;
•higher volumes and favorable product mix of $47 million due to strength in automated equipment sales and higher food service demand; and
•lower operating costs of $19 million, primarily due to incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of supply chain disruptions.
These increases were partially offset by:
•higher input costs resulting in unfavorable net price realization of $82 million.

Protective
2022 compared with 2021
On a reported basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $19 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by unfavorable foreign currency translation of $17 million. On a constant dollar basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $36 million, or 8%, in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the impact of:
•favorable net price realization of $140 million.
This increase was partially offset by:
•lower volumes of $93 million, primarily due to recessionary pressures in the industrial and fulfillment markets and de-stocking throughout the value chain;
•divestiture impact of $6 million; and
•higher operating costs of $5 million, due to increased investment spend in the business to drive future growth, including higher travel and entertainment expenses.
2021 compared with 2020
On a reported basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $38 million in 2021 as compared to 2020. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by favorable foreign currency translation of $7 million. On a constant dollar basis, Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $31 million, or 8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to the impact of:
•higher volumes of $62 million on strength in fulfillment, higher industrial segment demand and increased automated equipment sales; and
•Reinvent SEE benefits of $14 million, driven by actions reducing operating costs, including restructuring savings of $10 million, and improvements to net price realization of $2 million.
These increases were partially offset by:
•unfavorable net price realization of $27 million; and
•higher operating costs of $18 million, primarily due to other costs associated with supply chain disruptions.
Corporate
2022 compared with 2021
Corporate Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $8 million on an as reported basis as compared to 2021, primarily driven by foreign currency losses, lower pension income and higher bank fee expenses in 2022.
2021 compared with 2020
Corporate Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million on an as reported basis and constant dollar basis as compared to 2020, primarily driven by an increase in non-operating income on closed defined benefit plans which are not attributable to either reporting segment.

Material Commitments and Contingencies
Settlement Agreement Tax Deduction
The information set forth in Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies,” under the caption “Settlement Agreement Tax Deduction” is incorporated herein by reference.

Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations primarily consist of short-term borrowings, principal and interest payments on long-term debt, operating and financing leases, dividend payments, compensation and benefit related obligations, including defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, and other contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business.

53

SEE has other principal contractual obligations which include agreements to purchase an estimated amount of goods, including raw materials, or services, including energy, assumed in the normal course of business. These obligations are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the purchase. We may purchase additional goods or services above the minimum requirements of these obligations and, as a result use additional cash. See Note 20, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes for additional information.

Liability for Unrecognized Tax Benefits
At December 31, 2022, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of $465 million of which we have reclassified $201 million to other current liabilities for the amounts expected to settle in 2023. See Note 19, “Income Taxes,” for further discussion.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have reviewed our off-balance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of those arrangements have a material current effect or is reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Income Tax Payments
We expect tax payments on our operations to be approximately $240 million to $250 million in 2023. Future payments are uncertain and dependent on a number of factors including the amount of future taxable income. The results of on-going appeals or audits by various taxing authorities, including the IRS, could increase our tax payments.

Interest Payments
Estimated future interest payments on the Company’s senior notes and senior secured credit facility through fiscal 2033 are expected to be $1,211 million, including $233 million expected in 2023, based on interest rates at December 31, 2022 and estimated incremental interest associated with the 2023 financing activities related to the Liquibox acquisition.
Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans
We maintain defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans for some of our U.S. and our non-U.S. employees. We currently expect our contributions to these plans to be approximately $4 million in 2023. Additionally, we expect benefits related to these plans paid directly by the Company to be $9 million in 2023. Future contributions and benefits paid directly by the Company are uncertain and rely on a number of factors including performance of underlying assets, future cash out flows of the plans, actuarial assumptions and funding discussions with boards charged with governance for some of our international plans. Refer to Note 17, “Profit Sharing, Retirement Savings Plans and Defined Benefit Pension Plans,” and Note 18, “Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans,” for additional information related to these plans.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals do not take into account any discounting for the time value of money and are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We reassess environmental liabilities whenever circumstances become better defined or we can better estimate remediation efforts and their costs. We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, we adjust the recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.
Indemnification obligations

54

We are a party to many contracts containing guarantees and indemnification obligations. These contracts include indemnities in connection with the sale of businesses, primarily related to the sale of Diversey in 2017. Because of the conditional nature of these obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement, we are unable to reasonably estimate the potential maximum exposure associated with these items.
Capital Expenditures
We expect payments for capital expenditures to be approximately $260 million to $280 million in 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Principal Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products and services to our customers and amounts available under our existing lines of credit, including our senior secured credit facility, and our accounts receivable securitization programs. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, stock repurchases, dividends, debt obligations, restructuring expenses and other long-term liabilities. We believe that our current liquidity position and future cash flows from operations will enable us to fund our operations, including all of the items mentioned above, in the next twelve months.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $456 million, of which approximately $347 million, or 76%, was located outside of the U.S. We believe our U.S. cash balances and committed liquidity facilities available to U.S. borrowers are sufficient to fund our U.S. operating requirements and capital expenditures, current debt obligations and dividends. The Company does not expect that, in the near term, cash located outside of the U.S. will be needed to satisfy our obligations, dividends and other demands for cash in the U.S. Of the cash balances located outside of the U.S., approximately $12 million are in the Company']:

['s participation in the program. We monitor our days payable outstanding relative to our peers and industry trends in order to assess our conclusion that these programs continue to be trade payable programs and not indicative of borrowing arrangements. The liabilities continue to be presented as Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until they are paid, and they are reflected as Cash flows from operating activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows when settled.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our accounts payable balances included $140 million and $161 million, respectively, related to invoices from suppliers participating in the programs. The cumulative amounts settled through the supply chain financing programs for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $463 million, compared to $417 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These programs did not significantly improve our cash provided by operating activities or free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

Debt Ratings
Our cost of capital and ability to obtain external financing may be affected by our debt ratings, which the credit rating agencies review periodically. Below is a table that details our credit ratings by the various types of debt by rating agency.

----------------------- ------------------------ ----------------
 Moody’s InvestorServices Standard& Poor’s
Corporate Rating Ba1 BB+
Senior Unsecured Rating Ba2 BB+
Senior Secured Rating Baa2 BBB-

Outlook Stable Stable

These credit ratings are considered to be below investment grade (with the exception of the Baa2 and BBB- Senior Secured Rating from Moody’s Investor Services and Standard & Poor’s, respectively, which are classified as investment grade). A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Outstanding Indebtedness
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our total debt outstanding and our non-U.S. GAAP net debt consisted of the amounts set forth in the following table.

--------------------------------------------- ------------ ------- ---- ------- - -------

Analysis of Historical Cash Flow
The following table shows the changes in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ------ ------- ---- ----- ------------- ------------- ------- ------- ------ - ------
 Year Ended December 31, Change
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 613.3 $ 709.7 $ 737.0 $ (96.4) $ (27.3)
Net cash used in investing activities (243.0) (125.7) (159.8) (117.3) 34.1
Net cash used in financing activities (446.7) (575.8) (261.7) 129.1 (314.1)
Effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (28.5) 4.1 (29.2) (32.6) 33.3

In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength and ability of our operations to generate cash. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for net income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures, as certain debt servicing requirements or other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted from this measure. We historically have generated the majority of our annual free cash flow in the second half of the year. Below are the details of non-U.S. GAAP free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

------------------------------------------ ----------------------- ----- ------ ------- ---- ----- ------------- ------------- ------ ------ ------- - ------

(In millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 2021 vs. 2020
Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 613.3 $ 709.7 $ 737.0 $ (96.4) $ (27.3)
Capital expenditures (237.3) (213.1) (181.1) (24.2) (32.0)
Non-U.S. GAAP free cash flow $ 376.0 $ 496.6 $ 555.9 $ (120.6) $ (59.3)

Operating Activities
2022 vs. 2021
Net cash provided by operating activities was $613 million during 2022, as compared to $710 million during 2021.
Net cash used by our working capital accounts (inventories, trade receivables, and accounts payable) was $178 million unfavorable during 2022, as compared to 2021. The impact of accounts payable on cash flow from operating activities was $278 million unfavorable compared to the prior year, as a result of lower balances due to a higher rate of raw material inflation and higher freight costs in 2021 as compared to 2022, coupled with a reduction in accounts payable balances in the fourth quarter of 2022 due to the moderation of purchasing activities tied to inventory reduction initiatives. Inventory was $13 million unfavorable to prior year due to stock build through the first three quarters of 2022 to mitigate global supply disruptions, raw material cost inflation, and lower sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2022. The unfavorable cash flow impact of accounts payable and inventory was partially offset by trade receivables, which generated approximately $113 million higher cash flow than the prior year. Trade receivables was favorable due to an increase in collections from our customers in 2022 as compared to prior year, as well as lower sales in the fourth quarter 2022 as compared to prior year.
Income taxes had a $59 million unfavorable indirect cash flow use of cash driven primarily by higher tax payments made in 2022 as compared to prior year.
This activity was partially offset by the increase in the reserve for uncertain tax positions which had a $42 million favorable impact on an indirect basis. Incentive compensation had a $33 million favorable impact on operating cash flow. Specifically, incentive compensation cash payments made during the first quarter 2022 were approximately $25 million lower than those made in first quarter 2021. Additionally, on an indirect basis, the December 31, 2022 accrual for payout in the first quarter 2023 was approximately $8 million higher than the accrual at December 31, 2021. The higher accrual is due to achievement of

58

performance metrics in the respective years. Indirect taxes were also favorable by $25 million compared to the prior year driven by the timing of payments in 2022 as compared to the prior year.
2021 vs. 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities was $710 million during 2021, as compared to $737 million during 2020.
Net cash used by our working capital accounts (inventories, trade receivables, and accounts payable) was $74 million unfavorable during 2021, as compared to 2020. The impact of inventory on cash flow from operating activities was $141 million unfavorable compared to 2020, as a result of higher balances due primarily to raw material cost inflation, coupled with business growth and stock build to mitigate continued global supply chain disruptions. Trade receivables was $138 million unfavorable to 2020, due to the impact of higher sales and the year over year impact of our accounts receivable factoring program (2020 year over year increase was more significant than the 2021 increase). The unfavorable cash flow impact of inventory and trade receivables was partially offset by accounts payable, which generated $205 million higher cash flow than 2020. Accounts payable was favorable due to continued raw material price increases throughout 2021 compared to price decreases during 2020, as well as higher logistic and freight balances throughout 2021 due to global supply chain disruptions.
The impact of incentive compensation had a $46 million unfavorable impact on operating cash flow. Specifically, on an indirect basis, the December 31, 2021 accrual for payout in the first quarter 2022 was approximately $30 million lower than the accrual at December 31, 2020. The lower accrual is due to achievement of performance metrics in the respective years. Additionally, incentive compensation cash payments made during the first quarter 2021 were approximately $16 million higher than those made in first quarter 2020. Indirect taxes were unfavorable by $25 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of payments and business performance.
This activity was partially offset by a $46 million decrease in restructuring and restructuring associated payments made for our Reinvent SEE business transformation, as compared to 2020, as well as $77 million favorable indirect cash flow benefit for income taxes, year over year, driven by changes in the income tax receivable balance.
Investing Activities
2022 vs. 2021
Net cash used in investing activities was $243 million during 2022, compared to net cash used in investing activities of $126 million during 2021.
In 2022, SEE generated a total of $9 million from the sale of businesses and property and equipment primarily related to the disposal of land in the UK. Cash received from the sale of businesses and property equipment in 2021 was $89 million, primarily driven by the 2021 sale of Reflectix, Inc. which generated proceeds of $83 million.
Capital expenditures were $24 million higher during 2022 as compared to 2021. The increase reflects the Company']:
