ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.

OVERVIEW

Our Business

We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household, personal care and specialty products focused on animal and food production, chemicals and cleaners. We focus our consumer products marketing efforts principally on our 14 “power brands.” These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER®, used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, cat litter, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent; TROJAN® condoms, lubricants and vibrators; OXICLEAN® stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergent and bleach alternatives; SPINBRUSH® battery-operated and manual toothbrushes; FIRST RESPONSE® home pregnancy and ovulation test kits; NAIR® depilatories; ORAJEL® oral analgesic; XTRA® laundry detergent; L’IL CRITTERS® and VITAFUSION® gummy dietary supplements; BATISTE® dry shampoos; WATERPIK® water flossers and replacement showerheads; ZICAM® cold shortening and relief products, THERABREATH® oral care products and HERO® acne treatment products. We reevaluate the composition of our “power brands” from time to time, and in 2022 removed FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS® products from our list of power brands and added HERO®.

We sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell the products to consumers. We sell our specialty products to industrial customers, livestock producers and through distributors.

We operate our business in three segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and the Specialty Products Division (“SPD”). The segments are based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. In 2022, the Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD segments represented approximately 77%, 17% and 6%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.

Supply Chain, Inflation, Labor, Consumer Demand and Competition

Throughout 2022, adverse impacts to our business have been primarily supply chain related, including raw material and labor shortages and interruptions, as well as distribution and transportation challenges. These negative impacts have resulted in difficulty meeting consumer demand. In addition, these negative impacts together with significant broad-based cost inflation have affected interest rates, input costs and consumer behavior. In addition, government restrictions in China have further exacerbated global supply chain challenges and have had a negative impact on Chinese consumer demand for our products in China. As restrictions in China ease, we expect those impacts to our business in the future to be less severe. While it is difficult to predict when conditions may improve, we expect raw material and labor shortages and input cost inflation to continue at least through the first half of 2023.

To address challenges meeting retail customer demand for certain categories, including laundry detergent and litter, we have taken steps to increase our short-term manufacturing capacity for those and other products as well as our raw material and packaging capacity, and continue to work closely with our suppliers, contract manufacturers and retail partners to increase capacity and ensure sustained supply to keep pace with increased demand. We have also made investments in the expansion of long-term in-house and third-party manufacturing capacity and are continuing to enlist additional suppliers that meet our quality specifications. We continued to see an improvement in fill rates in the fourth quarter, particularly in the household category, and we expect those improvements to continue into 2023 across most product categories. While we have made significant progress addressing our manufacturing capacity to meet consumer demand, there is no assurance that these challenges will abate in the foreseeable future, or that the other measures we have or may implement will mitigate the impact of supply disruptions or rising costs. If we continue to experience difficulty meeting consumer and retailer demand over an extended period, retailers may decide to discontinue distribution of all or some of our products.

To attempt to offset some of our cost pressures, we have enacted and continue to evaluate price increases in certain categories. However, we are also experiencing a decline in consumer spending for our most discretionary brands, primarily WATERPIK and FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS. Our WATERPIK brand has also been impacted by a consumer shift to lower cost alternatives due primarily to inflationary pressures and recessionary concerns. Most notably, a growing number of water flosser consumers are continuing to switch to competitors' value-branded products. In addition, due to the decline in consumer spending, a major retailer has discontinued certain of our FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS products. If the decline in consumer spending for our discretionary products persists over an extended period, we may not be able to increase prices to offset cost inflation and retailers may further discontinue distribution of these products. To address these demand shifts, we are taking steps to better manage production schedules and inventory levels for those products

along with increasing promotional activities and marketing spend, as well as continuing efforts to develop lower cost water flosser alternatives.

In the vitamin category there continues to be a softening of growth from record high levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and significant product competition coming from new category entrants. In the two-year period from 2019 to 2021 our vitamin products experienced a net sales increase of over 50%. The category has grown from about 10 competitors a decade ago to more than 50 of significance in recent years. Since 2019 alone, over 35 new brands have entered the gummy category. We continue to evaluate and vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending. However, there is no assurance this category will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline. Additionally, the fill rates for our vitamin products have been below historical levels, if we continue to have challenges meeting customer demand, we are vulnerable to retail customers limiting distribution of our vitamin products and consumers shifting their loyalty to competitors’ products.

Approximately 20% of our portfolio is comprised of discretionary products (WATERPIK and FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS) and the vitamin business. In addition, our portfolio is comprised of 40% value products and has a low exposure to private label which should help us to mitigate against a potential recessionary environment. We expect share gains to continue as we invest in our brands and supply chain fill levels continue to improve.

Looking forward, the impact that these challenges will continue to have on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including inflationary impacts, retail customer’s acceptance of all or a portion of any price increases, our continued ability to obtain an adequate supply of products and materials, the spread and severity of new COVID-19 variants, and the long-term impact of vaccines. Additionally, we may be impacted by our ability to recruit and retain a workforce and engage third-parties to manufacture and distribute our products, as well as any future government actions affecting employers and employees, consumers and the economy in general. The impact of any of these potential future developments are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape.

We are monitoring the impact of both inflation and recessionary indicators including the effect of corresponding government actions, such as raising interest rates to counteract inflation, that may negatively impact consumer spending, and how these factors will potentially influence future cash flows for the short and long term. While we expect that many of these effects will be transitory and that our value focused portfolio positions us well in inflationary and slowing economic environments, it is impossible to predict their impact.

2022 Financial Highlights

Key 2022 financial results include:

•
2022 net sales grew 3.6% over 2021, with gains in Consumer Domestic and SPD, partially offset by lower sales in Consumer International. The gains are primarily due to favorable pricing/product mix in all three segments and acquisitions in Consumer Domestic and Consumer International, partially offset by unfavorable volumes in all three segments and unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates in Consumer International.

•
Gross margin decreased 170 basis points to 41.9% in 2022 from 43.6% in 2021, primarily due to higher manufacturing costs including labor, raw materials and components, and higher transportation and commodity costs, as well as unfavorable volumes, partially offset by favorable price/product mix, the impact of productivity programs, and business acquisition benefits.

•
Operating margin decreased 970 basis points to 11.1% in 2022 from 20.8% in 2021, reflecting a lower gross margin percentage and higher selling general and administrative costs (including the non-cash Flawless intangible asset impairment charge of $411.0 or 760 bps and 2021's favorable $98.0 or 190 bps Flawless business acquisition liability adjustments), partially offset by lower marketing expenses.

•
We reported diluted net earnings per share in 2022 of $1.68 (including the non-cash Flawless intangible asset impairment charge of $1.26 per share), a decrease of approximately 49.4% from 2021 diluted net earnings per share of $3.32 which included the favorable impact of the Flawless business acquisition liability adjustments of $0.30 per share.

•
Cash provided by operations was $885.2 in 2022, a $108.6 decrease from the prior year due to higher working capital and lower cash earnings (net income adjusted for non-cash items).

•
We returned $255.0 in 2022 to our stockholders through cash dividends paid.

Strategic Goals, Challenges and Initiatives

Our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products and retail customers’ decisions to carry our products, which are, in part, affected by general economic conditions in our markets. While a vast majority of our products are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, certain of our products, are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending. Some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings (primarily in the dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories), launching their own brands, and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category. In addition, an increasing portion of our product categories are being sold by club stores, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers. These factors have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins.

We intend to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives: maintain competitive marketing and trade spending, tightly control our cost structure, expand our online market share, continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursue strategic acquisitions. We also intend to continue to grow our product sales globally and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products to appeal to a wide range of consumers.

We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from sales of liquid laundry detergent. As a result, any delays or reduction of sales of these products, in the event that our product category diversification efforts discussed below are not successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flows. We continue to evaluate and vigorously address these pressures through, among other things, new product introductions and increased marketing and trade spending. However, there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that we will be able to offset any such decline.

We are continuously focused on strengthening our key brands through the launch of innovative new products, which span various product categories, including premium and value household products supported by increased marketing and trade spending. There can be no assurance that these measures will be successful.

In the domestic business, seven out of 14 “power brands” met or exceeded category growth for the full year 2022. With the acquisition of HERO®, we have 14 “power brands”. Our global product portfolio consists of both premium (60% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2022) and value (40% of total worldwide consumer revenue in 2022) brands, which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments. We intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among cost-conscious consumers.

Over the past two decades, we have diversified from an almost exclusively U.S. business to a global company with approximately 17% of sales derived from countries outside of the United States in 2022. We have subsidiary operations in seven countries (Canada, Mexico, U.K., France, Germany, China and Australia). We also export products to over 130 other countries through our Global Markets Group using a broad network of third-party distributors. In 2022, we benefited from our expanded global footprint and expect to continue to focus on selectively expanding our global business. If we are unable to expand our business internationally at the rate that we expect, we may not realize our anticipated growth targets.

Although we believe ongoing international expansion represents a significant opportunity to grow our business, our increasing activity in global markets exposes us to additional complexity and uncertainty. Sales generated outside of the U.S. are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as political uncertainty which could impact future operating results. Moreover, the current domestic and international political environment, including existing and potential changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, have resulted in uncertainty regarding the global economy. The impact of U.S. tariffs on certain products was a component of increased cost of sale during the year ended December 31, 2022. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we manufacture or sell large quantities of products could negatively impact our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.

We also continue to focus on controlling our costs. Historically, we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and, to a lesser extent, by passing along cost increases to customers. We have also entered into set pricing and pre-buying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel and other commodities. Additionally, our focus on tight cost controls has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions. In 2022, due to the significant increase in input costs, we have not been able to fully mitigate the impact of these increases with pricing, cost control measures and productivity programs. We have, and will continue to, implement price increases to address cost inflation. However, we cannot be certain that these price increases will be accepted by customers.

The identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy and product category diversification. Acquisitions have added significantly to our sales, profits and product category diversification over the last decade. This is evidenced by our 2015 acquisition of certain assets of Varied Industries Corporation (the “Vi-cor Acquisition”), the 2016 acquisitions of Spencer Forrest, Inc., the maker of TOPPIK (the “Toppik Acquisition”), and the ANUSOL and RECTINOL businesses from Johnson &

Johnson (the “Anusol Acquisition”), the 2017 acquisitions of the VIVISCAL brand from Lifes2Good Holdings Limited (the “Viviscal Acquisition”), Agro BioSciences, Inc. (the “Agro Acquisition”), and the WATERPIK brand from Pik Holdings, Inc. (the “Waterpik Acquisition”), the 2018 acquisition of Passport Food Safety Solutions, Inc. (the “Passport Acquisition”), the 2019 acquisition of the FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS brand; the 2020 acquisition of the ZICAM brand from Consumer Health Holdco LLC, the 2021 acquisition of the THERABREATH brand from Dr. Harold Katz, LLC and HK-IP International, Inc, and the 2022 acquisition of the HERO brand which includes the MIGHTY PATCH acne treatment products. The failure to effectively identify or integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause us to incur material asset write-downs. We actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines, and our strong financial position provides us with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities. In addition, our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions. Since 2001, we have acquired 13 of our 14 “power brands”.

We believe we are well positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives. Our focus is to maintain competitive marketing and trade spending, manage our cost structure, continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products, while pursuing strategic acquisitions. This focus, together with the strength of our portfolio of premium and value brands, has enabled us to succeed in a range of economic environments. Moreover, the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations combined with an investment grade credit rating, provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions, drive new product development, make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements, return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs, and reduce outstanding debt. These factors position us to continue to increase stockholder value over the long-term.

For information regarding risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and cash flows, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.

Recent Developments

Hero Acquisition

On October 13, 2022, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Hero Cosmetics, Inc. ("Hero"), the developer of the Hero® brand which includes the MIGHTY PATCH® acne treatment products (the “Hero Acquisition”). We paid $546.8, net of cash acquired, at closing, and deferred an additional cash payment of $8.0 for five years to satisfy certain indemnification obligations, if necessary. We also issued $61.5 of restricted stock which will be recognized as compensation expense as the vesting requirements for individuals who received the restricted stock and will continue to be employed by us are satisfied. The vesting requirements are satisfied at various dates over a three-year period from the date of the acquisition. Hero’s annual net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately $179.0. The Hero Acquisition was financed with cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings and is managed in the Consumer Domestic segment.

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022

On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Act”), which contains provisions effective January 1, 2023, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. While we are still evaluating the impact of the Act, we do not expect any material changes on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Dividend Increase

On February 1, 2023, the Board declared a 4% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.2625 to $0.2725 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.09 per share payable to stockholders of record as of February 15, 2023. The increase raises the annual dividend payout from $255.0 to approximately $265.0.

Russia - Ukraine War

The global economy continues to be negatively impacted by the war between Russia and Ukraine. Furthermore, governments in the U.S., United Kingdom, and European Union have each imposed export controls on certain products as well as financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia and Belarus. We have experienced material shortages and increased costs for transportation, energy, and raw material due in part to the negative impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the global economy including European energy market access to Russian energy sources. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, cyber attacks, supply disruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain.

We have no operations in Russia or Ukraine. Sales into Russia and Belarus, which have been suspended indefinitely, are not material to our consolidated net sales and earnings.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty. They are based on our historical experience, our observation of trends in industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are described below.

Revenue Recognition and Promotional and Sales Return Reserves

Virtually all of our revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by our customers. The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers). All such costs are netted against sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer. Cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for our products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements and coupons are recorded when the related sale takes place. Costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold. We rely on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves. For example, we use historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements. Based on the total face value of Consumer Domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, a difference of approximately $2.7 in the reserve required for coupons would result. With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, we use experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required. If our estimates for promotional activities and sales returns reserves were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $15.9. While management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations.

Impairment of goodwill, trade names and other intangible assets

The Company has intangible assets of substantial value on its consolidated balance sheet. These intangible assets are generally related to intangible assets with a useful life, indefinite-lived trade names and goodwill. The Company determines whether an intangible asset (other than goodwill) has a useful life based on multiple factors, including how long the Company intends to generate cash flows from the asset.

Carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names are reviewed periodically for possible impairment. Finite intangible assets are assessed when there are business triggering events. Our impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate and royalty rate. Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions. With respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit. For trade names and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. Judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired. The result of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units.

Fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets was estimated based on a “relief from royalty” or “excess earnings” discounted cash flow method, which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could impact fair values in the future. We determined that the fair value of all indefinite-lived intangible assets for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 exceeded their respective carrying values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability.

In recent years our global TROJAN business, specifically the condom category, has not grown and competition has increased. In addition, profitability was negatively impacted throughout 2022 by inflation, resulting in higher input costs and discount rates, and supply shortages for packaging materials. As a result, the TROJAN business has experienced sales and profit declines that have eroded a significant portion of the excess between the fair and carrying value of the tradename, which was $176.4 as of December 31, 2022. This indefinite-lived intangible asset may be susceptible to impairment and a continued decline in fair value could trigger a future impairment charge of the TROJAN tradename. While management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of the asset.

Our global WATERPIK business has recently experienced a significant decline in customer demand for many of its products, primarily due to lower consumer spending for discretionary products from inflation and a growing number of water flosser consumers switching to more value-branded products. As a result, the WATERPIK business has experienced declining sales and profits resulting in a reduction in expected future cash flows which have eroded a substantial portion of the excess between the fair and carrying value of the tradename, which was $644.7 as of December 31, 2022. This indefinite-lived intangible asset may be susceptible to impairment and a continued decline in fair value could trigger a future impairment charge of the WATERPIK tradename. While management can and has implemented strategies to address the risk, significant changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges of these assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined that a review of our ability to recover the carrying values of the global FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS intangible assets was necessary based on the discontinuance of certain products at a major retailer. The FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS assets consist of the definite-lived tradename, customer relationships and technology assets recorded at acquisition. We evaluated our ability to recover the carrying values of the intangible assets by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows and determined that the cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets. After determining the estimated fair value of the assets, which included a reduction in cash flows due to the loss of distribution mentioned above along with an expected continued decline in discretionary consumption and higher interest rates, a non-cash impairment charge of $411.0 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022. The remaining net book value of the tradename as of December 31, 2022 is $46.3 and will be amortized over a remaining useful life of three years. We are implementing strategies to address the decline in profitability. However, if unsuccessful, a further decline could trigger a future impairment charge.

It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) the businesses or brands do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered “more likely than not” to be realized. We record liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under U.S. GAAP guidelines. The liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by us, may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement. We adjust this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change. In this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate. Conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate.

Net Sales

Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $5,375.6, an increase of $185.5, or 3.6% compared to 2021 net sales. The components of the net sales increase are as follows:

------------------------------------------ ----------------- ---- --
Net Sales - Consolidated December 31, 2022
Product volumes sold (5.1 %)
Pricing/Product mix 6.5 %
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations / Other (1.0 %)
Acquired product lines (1) 3.2 %
Net Sales increase 3.6 %

(1)
On October 13, 2022, we completed the Hero Acquisition. On December 24, 2021, we completed the TheraBreath Acquisition. The results of these acquisitions are included in our results since the date of acquisition.

 The volume change reflects decreased product unit sales for all three segments. Price/mix was favorable in all three segments.

Gross Profit

Our gross profit for 2022 was $2,250.0, a $13.5 decrease compared to 2021. Gross margin was 41.9% in 2022 compared to 43.6% in 2021, a 170 basis points (“bps”) decrease. The decrease is due to the impact of higher manufacturing costs, including labor of 270 bps, higher commodities of 230 bps, the impact of lower sales volumes of 110 bps, and higher transportation costs of 40 bps, partially offset by favorable price/mix of 320 bps, the impact of productivity programs of 110 bps, and business acquisition mix benefits of 50 bps.

Operating Costs

Marketing expenses for 2022 were $535.2, a decrease of $42.5 compared to 2021. Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 110 bps to 10.0% in 2022 as compared to 2021 due to 80 bps on lower expenses as we reduced spending throughout most of 2022 due to low case fill rates, and 30 bps of leverage on higher net sales.

SG&A expenses for 2022 were $1,117.0, an increase of $510.3 or 84.1% compared to 2021. The increase is primarily due to the non-cash Flawless intangible asset impairment charges of $411.0 and 2021’s favorable $98.0 Flawless business acquisition liability adjustments, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 910 bps to 20.8% in 2022 compared to 11.7% in 2021. The increase is due to 950 bps on higher expenses (including the Flawless impairment), offset by 40 bps of leverage associated with higher sales.

Other Income and Expenses

Other expense increased nominally in 2022 as compared to 2021.

Interest expense in 2022 was $89.6, an increase of $35.1. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt outstanding and higher interest rates.

Taxation

The 2022 U.S. federal effective income tax rate was 20.9% compared to 19.8% in 2021. The increase in the tax rate is primarily due to a lower tax benefit related to lower stock option exercises.

On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Act”), which contains provisions effective January 1, 2023, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. While we are still evaluating the impact of the Act, we do not expect any material changes on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Segment results for 2022, 2021 and 2020

We operate three reportable segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD. These segments are determined based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. We also have a Corporate segment.

---------------------- ------------------------------------
Segment Products
Consumer Domestic Household and personal care products
Consumer International Primarily personal care products
SPD Specialty chemical products

The Corporate segment income consists of equity in earnings of affiliates. As of December 31, 2022, we held 50% ownership interests in each of Armand and ArmaKleen, respectively.

Consumer Domestic

2022 compared to 2021

Consumer Domestic net sales in 2022 were $4,131.0, an increase of $189.1 or 4.8% compared to net sales of $3,941.9 in 2021. The components of the net sales change are the following:

----------------------------- ----------------- ---- --
Net Sales - Consumer Domestic December 31, 2022
Product volumes sold (5.9 %)
Pricing/Product mix 6.8 %
Acquired product lines (1) 3.9 %
Net Sales increase 4.8 %

(1)
Includes the Hero and TheraBreath Acquisitions since the date of acquisition.

The increase in net sales for 2022 reflects the impact of the Hero and TheraBreath Acquisitions, and higher net sales in ARM & HAMMER® Liquid Detergent, OXICLEAN® Powder, ARM & HAMMER® Cat Litter, and BATISTE® dry shampoo, partially offset by declines in FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS® Hair Removal Products, WATERPIK® Shower Heads, and VITAFUSION® and L’IL CRITTERS® gummy vitamins.

Consumer Domestic income before income taxes for 2022 was $427.3, a $434.1 decrease as compared to 2021. The decrease is due primarily to higher SG&A expenses of $437.7 (from the 2022 FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $349.3 and the favorable reduction in the fair value of the FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS business acquisition liability in 2021 of $83.2). Also impacting Consumer Domestic was higher manufacturing and distribution expenses of $150.6, the impact of lower sales volumes of $67.9, and higher interest and other expenses of $24.8, partially offset by a favorable price/mix of $216.7 and lower marketing expenses of $29.1.

Consumer International

2022 compared to 2021

Consumer International net sales in 2022 were $896.1, a decrease of $16.1 or 1.8% as compared to 2021. The components of the net sales change are the following:

---------------------------------- ----------------- ---- --
Net Sales - Consumer International December 31, 2022
Product volumes sold (1.7 %)
Pricing/Product mix 4.5 %
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (5.5 %)
Acquired product lines (1) 0.9 %
Net Sales decrease (1.8 %)

(1)
Includes the TheraBreath Acquisition since the date of acquisition.

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and acquired product lines, sales growth is driven by the BATISTE and CURASH brands in Australia, the BATISTE, GRAVOL, and ARM & HAMMER® Cat Litter in Canada, and the BATISTE brand in Europe.

Consumer International income before income taxes was $38.8 in 2022, a decrease of $88.5 compared to 2021 due to higher SG&A expenses of $78.1 (from the 2022 FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of $61.7 and favorable reduction in the fair value of the FINISHING TOUCH FLAWLESS business acquisition liability in 2021 of $14.8). Also impacting Consumer International was higher manufacturing and commodity costs of $38.6, unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $19.4, and the impact of lower sales volumes of $4.3, partially offset by a favorable price/mix of $34.0, lower marketing expenses of $17.1, and lower interest and other expenses of $0.6.

Specialty Products

2022 compared to 2021

SPD net sales were $348.5 for 2022, an increase of $12.5, or 3.7% compared to 2021. The components of the net sales change are the following:

-------------------- ----------------- ---- --
Net Sales - SPD December 31, 2022
Product volumes sold (5.1 %)
Pricing/Product mix 8.8 %
Net Sales increase 3.7 %

 Net sales increased primarily due to higher pricing in our dairy and specialty chemicals segments in response to rising costs.

SPD income before income taxes was $44.9 in 2022, an increase of $11.3 compared to 2021. The increase in income before income taxes for 2022 is due primarily to favorable price/product mix of $29.7 and lower SG&A costs of $12.1, which were offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs of $20.8, higher interest and other expenses of $5.8, the impact of lower sales volumes of $3.8 and higher marketing expenses of $0.1.

 Corporate

Corporate includes administrative costs of the production, planning and logistics functions which are allocated to the operating segments in SG&A expenses but are elements of cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Such amounts were $34.3, $47.1 and $59.8 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Also included in corporate are the equity in earnings of affiliates from Armand and ArmaKleen, totaling $12.3, $9.4 and $6.7 for the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

On June 16, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for our $1,500.0 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) that matures on June 16, 2027, unless extended. The Credit Agreement replaced our prior $1,000.0 unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on March 29, 2024 that was entered into on March 29, 2018. We have the ability to increase our borrowing up to an additional $750.0, subject to lender commitments and certain conditions as described in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are available for general corporate purposes and are used to support our $1,500.0 commercial paper program.

As of December 31, 2022, we had $270.3 in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $1,426.0 available through the Revolving Credit Facility and our commercial paper program. To preserve our liquidity, we invest cash primarily in government money market funds, prime money market funds, short-term commercial paper and short-term bank deposits.

On October 31, 2022, we issued $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 5.60% Senior Notes due 2032 (the “2032 Notes”). The proceeds from the sale of the 2032 Notes were used to repay commercial paper debt incurred to finance the Hero Acquisition, and related fees and expenses. The 2032 Notes will mature on November 15, 2032, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the supplemental indenture governing the terms of the 2032 Notes.

On June 2, 2022, we issued $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2052 (the “2052 Notes”). In July 2022 a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 2052 Notes were used to repay all of our outstanding $300.0 2.45% Senior Notes due August 1, 2022. The 2052 Notes will mature on June 15, 2052, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the supplemental indenture governing the terms of the 2052 Notes.

In October 2022, we repaid all of the outstanding $400.0 2.875% Senior notes due October 1, 2022 with a portion of the proceeds from the 2052 Notes and cash on hand.

On December 22, 2021, we entered into a $400.0 unsecured term loan facility (as amended on June 16, 2022, the “Term Loan Facility”) with various banks. The loan under the Term Loan Facility (the “Term Loan”) was fully drawn at closing. Unless repaid early, the Term Loan is due on December 22, 2024. The interest rate is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a spread and an applicable margin based on the Company’s credit rating, which can range from 60 basis points to 125 bps. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to partially fund the TheraBreath Acquisition, with the remaining proceeds used for the repayment of commercial paper. In January 2023, we repaid $100.0 of the Term Loan with cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings.

Additionally, we financed the TheraBreath Acquisition with a portion of the proceeds from an underwritten public offering of $400.0 aggregate principal amount Senior Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”) completed on December 10, 2021. The 2031 Notes will mature on December 15, 2031, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the supplemental indenture governing the terms of the 2031 Notes.

We financed the Waterpik Acquisition with a portion of the proceeds from an underwritten public offering of $1,425.0 aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes completed on July 25, 2017, consisting of $300.0 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes that were due in 2019 and have been fully repaid, $300.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes that were due in 2022 and have been fully repaid, $425.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.15% Senior Notes due 2027 and $400.0 aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due 2047.

In 2015, we initiated a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF Program”). Under the SCF Program, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from us for early payment. Participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with a third party. We are not party to those agreements and do not have an economic interest in the supplier’s decision to sell their receivables. The SCF Program may allow suppliers more favorable terms than they could secure on their own. The terms of our payment obligations are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF Program. Our payment terms with suppliers are consistent between suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF Program and those that do not participate. As a result, the program does not have an impact to our average days outstanding.

All amounts outstanding to suppliers participating in the SCF Program are recorded within Accounts Payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for our liquidity. See the discussion of this and other risks under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report. We continue to manage all aspects of our business including, but not limited to, monitoring the financial health of our customers, suppliers and other third-party relationships, implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth. We do not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect our ability to comply with the financial covenant in the Credit Agreement because we currently are, and anticipate that we will continue to be, in compliance with the maximum leverage ratio requirement under the Credit Agreement.

On October 28, 2021, the Board authorized a new share repurchase program under which we may purchase up to $1,000.0 in shares of Common Stock (the “2021 Share Repurchase Program”). The 2021 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration and replaces our 2017 Share Repurchase Program. The 2021 Share Repurchase Program does not modify our evergreen share repurchase program, authorized by the Board on January 29, 2014, under which we may repurchase, from time to time, Common Stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of Common Stock under our incentive plans.

In December 2021, we executed open market purchases of 1.8 million shares for $170.3, inclusive of fees, of which $100.0 was purchased under the evergreen share repurchase program and $70.3 was purchased under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program. In December 2021, we also entered into an ASR contract with a commercial bank to purchase Common Stock. We paid $200.0 to the bank, inclusive of fees, and received an initial delivery of shares equal to $180.0, or 1.8 million shares. We used cash on hand and short-term borrowings to fund the initial purchase price. Upon the completion of the ASR, which ended in February 2022, the bank delivered an additional 0.2 million shares to us. The final shares delivered to us were determined by the average price per share paid by the bank during the purchase period. All 2.0 million shares were purchased under our 2021 Share Repurchase Program.

As a result of our stock repurchases, there remains $729.7 of share repurchase availability under the 2021 Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2022.

On February 1, 2023, the Board declared a 4% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.2625 to $0.2725 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.09 per share payable to stockholders of record as of February 15, 2023. The increase raises the annual dividend payout from $255.0 to approximately $265.0.

We anticipate that our cash from operations, together with our current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to fund our share repurchase programs to the extent implemented by management, pay debt and interest as it comes due and pay dividends at the latest approved rate, and meet our capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $250.0 in 2023 primarily for manufacturing capacity investments in laundry, litter and vitamins to support expected future sales growth. Cash, together with our current borrowing capacity, may be used for acquisitions that would complement our existing product lines or geographic markets.

Cash Flow Analysis

----------------------------------------- ------------ ------ - ------------ - ------ ------------ - ------ -
 Year Ended
 December 31, December 31, December 31,
 2022 2021 2020
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 885.2 $ 993.8 $ 990.3
Net cash used in investing activities $ (728.6 ) $ (682.0 ) $ (608.1 )
Net cash used in financing activities $ (120.9 ) $ (252.1 ) $ (360.1 )

2022 compared to 2021

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities – Our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow provided by operating activities, which is dependent on the level of net income and changes in working capital. Our net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 decreased by $108.6 to $885.2 as compared to $993.8 in 2021 due to an increase in working capital and lower cash earnings (net income adjusted for non-cash items). The increase in working capital is primarily related to higher inventory balances as we increased inventory early in 2022 to ensure supply and then experienced lower demand for certain products later in the year. We measure working capital effectiveness based on our cash conversion cycle. The following table presents our cash conversion cycle information for the quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:

-------------------------------------------------------- ----------------- -- ----------------- -- ------ -
 As of
 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Change
Days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") 28 28 0
Days of inventory outstanding ("DIO") 69 64 5
Days of accounts payable outstanding ("DPO") 78 78 0
Cash conversion cycle 19 14 5

Our cash conversion cycle (defined as the sum of DSO plus DIO less DPO) at December 31, 2022, which is calculated using a two period average method, increased 5 days from the prior year due to an increase in DIO of 5 days from the increase in inventory balances as we increased inventory early in 2022 to ensure supply and then experienced lower demand for certain products later in the year. We continue to focus on reducing our working capital requirements.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities – Net cash used in investing activities during 2022 was $728.6, primarily reflecting $546.8 for the Hero Acquisition and $178.8 for property, plant and equipment additions. Net cash used in investing activities during 2021 was $682.0, primarily reflecting $556.0 for the TheraBreath Acquisition and $118.8 for property, plant and equipment additions.

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities – Net cash used in financing activities during the twelve months of 2022 was $120.9, reflecting $255.0 of cash dividend payments and $12.0 of financing costs, partially offset by $119.9 of net debt borrowings, and $26.2 of proceeds from stock option exercises. Net cash used in financing activities during the twelve months of 2021 was $252.1, reflecting $500.0 of repurchases of our Common Stock, $247.5 of cash dividend payments and $3.9 of financing costs, partially offset by $400.7 of net debt borrowings, and $98.7 of proceeds from stock option exercises.

OTHER ITEMS

Market risk

Concentration of Risk

A group of four customers accounted for approximately 42% of consolidated net sales in 2022. A group of three customers accounted for approximately 37% of consolidated net sales in 2021 and 36% in 2020, of which a single customer (Walmart Inc. and its affiliates) accounted for approximately 24%, 24% and 23% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

We had outstanding total debt at December 31, 2022, of $2,673.5, net of debt issuance costs, of which approximately 82% has a fixed weighted average interest rate of 4.1% and the remaining 18% was constituted of commercial paper issued by us that currently has a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.0% and the term loan due 2024 with a current rate of approximately 5.1%. From time to time the Company will enter into interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk of changes in the interest payments attributable to changes in the interest rate associated with anticipated issuances of debt.

Other Market Risks

We are also subject to market risks relating to our diesel and other commodity costs, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and changes in the market price of the Common Stock. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of these market risks and the derivatives used to manage the risks associated with changing diesel fuel and other commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and the price of our Common Stock.
