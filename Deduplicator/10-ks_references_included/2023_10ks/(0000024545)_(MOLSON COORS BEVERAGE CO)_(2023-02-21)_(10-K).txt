Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Items Affecting Reported Results" for further discussion. For considerations of the effects of cost inflation to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets."Coronavirus Global Pandemic We have been actively monitoring the impact of the coronavirus pandemic since it started at the end of the first quarter of 2020. The extent to which our operations will continue to be impacted by the coronavirus pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including, but not limited to, the level of governmental or societal orders or restrictions on public gatherings and on-premise venues including any vaccine mandates or testing requirements, the severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic by market including future outbreaks of variants, changes in consumer behavior, the rate of vaccination and the efficacy of vaccines against the coronavirus and related variants. We continue to actively monitor the ongoing evolution of the coronavirus pandemic and resulting impacts to our business. At the onset of the pandemic, during the first quarter of 2020, we initiated temporary keg relief programs in many of our markets which were negatively impacted. As a result, during 2020, we recognized a reduction to net sales of $30.3 million reflecting estimated sales returns and reimbursements through these keg relief programs. Further, during 2020, we recognized charges of $12.1 million within cost of goods sold related to obsolete finished goods keg inventories that were not expected to be sold within our freshness specifications, as well as the costs to facilitate the above mentioned keg returns. Additionally, during 2020, we recorded charges of $15.5 million within cost of goods sold related to temporary "thank you" pay for certain essential Americas segment brewery employees. In response to the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, various governmental authorities globally announced relief programs, which among other items, provided temporary deferrals of non-income based tax payments, which positively impacted our operating cash flows in 2020. These temporary net tax payment deferrals of approximately $25 million and $130 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, were primarily included within accounts payable and other current liabilities on our audited consolidated balance sheets. Of the $130 million of temporary net tax payment deferrals as of December 31, 2020, approximately $105 million was repaid during the year ended December 31, 2021, with approximately $25 million outstanding as of December 31, 2021. The remaining was repaid during the year ended December 31, 2022. We protected and supported our liquidity position in response to the global economic uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic. Beginning with the second quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021, our board of directors suspended our regular quarterly dividends on our Class A and Class B common and exchangeable shares. A quarterly dividend was reinstated in the third quarter of 2021.Revitalization Plan On October 28, 2019, we initiated a revitalization plan designed to allow us to invest across our portfolio to drive long-term, sustainable success. The revitalization plan established Chicago, Illinois as our Americas segment operational headquarters. We closed our office in Denver, Colorado and consolidated certain administrative functions into our other existing office locations. As of January 1, 2020, we changed our name to Molson Coors Beverage Company and changed our management structure to two segments - Americas and EMEA&APAC. We began to incur charges related to these restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of 2019 and we recognized severance and retention charges of $4.0 million and $35.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the revitalization plan restructuring charges were substantially complete. See Note 17, "Other Operating Income (Expense), net" for further discussion of the impacts of this plan.Government Assistance We receive government assistance in the form of tax credits and grants, including tax credits from government agencies in certain jurisdictions around job creation and retention, as well as capital investment initiatives. This includes, but is not limited to, refundable and non-refundable property and income tax credits in various state and other local jurisdictions. We recognize amounts received from government assistance programs, including tax credits and grants, as a reduction to MG&A expenses in our consolidated financial statements, when it is probable we will receive the funds and have met the conditions, if any, required by the government assistance program. If we receive the government assistance at a point in time for services to be completed over time, the cash received is initially recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as other liabilities, and amortized as an offset to MG&A expenses over the service period of the agreement. No programs are individually material nor are the programs material in the aggregate. Principles of ConsolidationOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries, as well as certain VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.Revenue RecognitionOur net sales represent the sale of beer, malt beverages and other adjacencies, net of excise tax. Sales are stated net of incentives, discounts and returns. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer, however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms. Where our products are sold under consignment arrangements, revenue is not recognized until control has transferred, which is when the product is sold to the end customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product. The cost of various programs, such as price promotions, rebates and coupons, are treated as a reduction of sales. In certain of our markets where legally permitted, we make cash payments to customers such as slotting or listing fees, or payments for other marketing or promotional activities. These cash payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless we receive a distinct good or service. Specifically, a good or service is considered distinct when it is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract, we receive a benefit from the good or service and the benefit is separable from the sale of our product to the customer.Certain payments made to customers are conditional on the achievement of volume targets, marketing commitments or both. If paid in advance, we record such payments as prepayments and amortize them over the relevant period to which the customer commitment is made (generally up to five years). When the payment is not for a distinct good or service, or fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, the amortization of the prepayment or the cost as incurred is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Where a distinct good or service is received and fair value can be reasonably estimated, the cost is included as MG&A expenses. The amounts deferred are reassessed regularly for recoverability over the contract period and are impaired where there is objective evidence that the benefits will not be realized or the asset is otherwise not recoverable. Separately, as discussed below, we analyze whether these advance payments contain a significant financing component for potential adjustment to the transaction price.Our primary revenue generating activity represents the sale of beer and other malt beverages to customers, including both domestic and exported product sales. Our customer could be a distributor, retail or on-premise outlet, depending on the market. The majority of our revenues are generated from brands that we own and brew ourselves; however, we also import or brew and sell certain non-owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. In addition, primarily in the U.K., we sell other beverage companies' products to on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. We refer to this as the "factored brand business." Sales from this business are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold. In the factored brand business, we normally purchase inventory, which includes excise taxes charged by the vendor, take orders from customers for such brands, negotiate with the customers on pricing and invoice customers for the product and related costs of delivery. In addition, we incur the risk of loss when we are in possession of the inventory and for the receivables due from the customers. Revenues for owned brands, partner and imported brands, as well as factored brands are recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer as discussed above. Other Revenue Generating ActivitiesWe contract manufacture for other brewers in some of our markets. These contractual agreements require us to brew, package and ship certain brands for these brewers, who then sell the products to their own customers in their respective markets. Revenues under contract brewing arrangements are recognized when our obligation related to the finished product is fulfilled and control of the product transfers to these other brewers.We also have licensing agreements with third party partners who brew and distribute our products in various markets across our segments. Under these agreements, we are compensated based on the amount of products sold by our partners in these markets at an agreed upon royalty rate or profit percentage. We apply the sales-based royalty practical expedient to these licensing arrangements and recognize revenue as product is sold by our partners at the agreed upon rate. Disaggregation of RevenueWe have evaluated our primary revenue generating activities under the disaggregation disclosure criteria outlined within the guidance and concluded that disclosure at the geographical segment level depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. We have also evaluated our other revenue generating activities and concluded that these activities are not material for separate disclosure. See Note 18, "Segment Reporting," for disclosure of revenues by geographic segment.Variable ConsiderationOur revenue generating activities include variable consideration which is recorded as a reduction of the transaction price based upon expected amounts at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. For example, customer promotional discount programs are entered into with certain distributors for certain periods of time. The amount ultimately reimbursed to distributors is determined based upon agreed-upon promotional discounts which are applied to distributors' sales to retailers. Other common forms of variable consideration include volume rebates for meeting established sales targets, and coupons and mail-in rebates offered to the end consumer. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recorded. We estimate this variable consideration, including analyzing for a potential constraint on variable consideration, by taking into account factors such as the nature of the promotional activity, historical information and current trends, availability of actual results and expectations of customer and consumer behavior.We do not have standard terms that permit return of product; however, in certain markets where returns occur we estimate the amount of returns as variable consideration based on historical return experience and adjust our revenue accordingly. Products that do not meet our high quality standards are returned by the customer or recalled and destroyed and are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The reversal of revenue is recorded upon determination that the product will be recalled and destroyed. We estimate the costs required to facilitate product returns and record them in cost of goods sold as required.For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied in the prior period due to changes in estimates in variable consideration were immaterial.Significant Financing Component and Costs to Obtain ContractsIn certain of our businesses where such practices are legally permitted, we make loans or advanced payments to retail outlets that sell our brands. For arrangements that do not span greater than one year, we apply the practical expedient available under ASC 606 and do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a potential significant financing component. We further analyze arrangements that span greater than one year on an ongoing basis to determine whether a significant financing component exists. No such arrangements existed during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.Advance payments to customers, where legally permitted, are deferred and amortized as a reduction to revenue over the expected period of benefit and tested for recoverability as appropriate. All other costs to obtain and fulfill contracts are expensed as incurred based on the nature, significance and expected benefit of these costs relative to the contract.Contract Assets and LiabilitiesWe continually evaluate whether our revenue generating activities and advanced payment arrangements with customers result in the recognition of contract assets or liabilities. No such assets or liabilities existed as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Separately, trade accounts receivable, including affiliate receivables, approximates receivables from contracts with customers. Shipping and HandlingFreight costs billed to customers for shipping and handling are recorded as revenue. Shipping and handling expense related to costs incurred to deliver product are recognized within cost of goods sold. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control has transferred as a fulfillment cost as opposed to a separate performance obligation, and the costs of shipping and handling are recognized concurrently with the related revenue. Excise TaxesExcise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on beer. Excise taxes are shown in a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of sales. In the consolidated balance sheets, excise taxes are generally recognized as a current liability within accounts payable and other current liabilities, with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority. In cases where excise taxes are prepaid, they are recorded within other current assets. Cost of Goods SoldOur cost of goods sold includes costs we incur to make and ship beer and other beverages. These costs include brewing materials, such as barley, hops and various grains. Packaging materials, such as glass bottles, aluminum cans, cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Additionally, our cost of goods sold include both direct and indirect labor, shipping and handling including freight costs, utilities, maintenance costs, warehousing costs, purchasing and receiving costs, depreciation, promotional packaging, other manufacturing overheads and costs to purchase factored and other non-owned brands from suppliers, as well as the estimated cost to facilitate product returns. Marketing, General and Administrative ExpensesOur MG&A expenses include marketing expenses, including the direct costs related to the selling of a product or brand, media advertising (television, radio, digital, print), tactical advertising (signs, banners, point-of-sale materials) and promotion costs on both local and national levels within our operating segments. The creative portion of our advertising activities is expensed as incurred. Production costs of advertising and promotional materials are expensed when the advertising is first run. Included in MG&A is total marketing and advertising expenses which were approximately $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $0.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.This classification also includes general and administrative costs for functions such as finance, legal, human resources and information technology. These costs primarily consist of labor and outside services, as well as bad debt expense related to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP, legal costs are expensed when incurred. These costs also include our marketing and sales organizations, including labor and other overheads. This line item additionally includes amortization costs associated with intangible assets, as well as certain depreciation costs related to non-production equipment and share-based compensation.Share-based compensation is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period of the awards. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. Our share-based compensation plan and the awards within it contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon change in control, retirement, disability or death of eligible employees and directors. Our share-based awards are considered vested when the employee's retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing service, which for certain awards can result in immediate recognition for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or accelerated recognition for awards granted to individuals that will become retirement eligible within the stated vesting period. Also, if less than the stated vesting period, we recognize these costs over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved.Other Operating Income (Expense), netOur other operating income (expense) items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that we believe are significant to our current operating results warranting separate classification; specifically, such items are considered to be one of the following:•restructuring charges, including atypical employee-related charges, asset abandonment-related losses, fees on termination of significant operating agreements and other related exit or disposal charges; •intangible and tangible asset impairments, excluding goodwill; •gains and (losses) on disposal of investments; and•other significant items deemed to warrant separate classification within operating incomeThese items classified as other operating income (expense) are not necessarily non-recurring, however, they are generally deemed to be incremental to income earned or costs incurred by us in conducting normal operations. Interest Expense, netOur interest costs are associated with borrowings to finance our operations and acquisitions. Interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents across our business is recorded as interest income. We capitalize interest cost as a part of the original cost of acquiring certain fixed assets if the cost of the capital expenditure and the expected time to complete the project are considered significant. Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), netOur other non-operating income (expense), net classification primarily includes gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to our operations. For instance, aggregate unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, as well as certain gains or losses on sales of non-operating assets and the mark-to-market activity associated with warrants and other equity securities are classified in this line item. These gains and losses are reported in the operating segment in which they occur; however, foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances related to financing and other treasury-related activities remain unallocated. The initial recording of foreign-denominated transactions are classified based on the nature of the transaction, with the unrealized or realized foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the subsequent remeasurement of the monetary asset or liability, and its ultimate settlement, classified in other non-operating income (expense), net. Income TaxesDeferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets, liabilities and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in AOCI. We apply the intraperiod tax allocation rules to allocate our provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings, such as other comprehensive income (loss), when we meet the criteria prescribed by U.S. GAAP. The tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is determined that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained based on its technical merits. We measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest, penalties and offsetting positions related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense with interest and penalties being recorded to the provision (benefit) for income taxes in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)OCI represents income and losses for the reporting period, including the related tax impacts, which are excluded from net income (loss) and recognized directly within AOCI as a component of equity. OCI also includes amounts reclassified to income during the reporting period that were previously recognized within AOCI. Amounts remaining within AOCI are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI in the future, at which point they will be recognized within the consolidated statement of operations as a component of net income (loss). We recognize OCI related to the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than the USD, unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion of our derivatives designated in cash flow hedging relationships and derivative and non-derivative instruments designated in net investment hedging relationships, actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, as well as our proportionate share of our equity method investments' OCI. Additionally, when we do not have the expectation or intent to cash settle certain of our intercompany note receivable and note payable positions in the foreseeable future, the remeasurement of these instruments is recorded as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments within OCI. We release stranded tax effects from AOCI using either a specific identification approach or portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item. Earnings Per ShareBasic EPS is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the additional dilutive effect of our potentially dilutive securities, which include RSUs, DSUs, PSUs and stock options. The dilutive effects of our potentially dilutive securities are calculated using the treasury stock method. Our calculation of weighted-average shares includes Class A common stock and Class B common stock and Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares. All classes of stock have in effect the same dividend rights and share equitably in undistributed earnings. Holders of Class A common stock receive dividends only to the extent dividends are declared and paid to holders of Class B common stock. See Note 14, "Stockholders' Equity" for further discussion of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock and Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares. We have no unvested outstanding equity share awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends.Anti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were 3.1 million, 1.8 million and 2.7 million shares, respectively.DividendsOn November 10, 2022, our Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.38 per share, paid on December 15, 2022, to shareholders of Class A and Class B common stock of record on December 2, 2022. Shareholders of exchangeable shares received the CAD equivalent of dividends declared on Class A and Class B common stock, equal to CAD 0.50 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2022, dividends declared to eligible shareholders totaled $1.52 per share, with the CAD equivalent totaling CAD 1.95 per share. In response to the global economic uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic, our Board of Directors suspended our regular quarterly dividend on our Class A and Class B common and exchangeable shares in May 2020. A quarterly dividend was reinstated during the third quarter of 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021, dividends declared to eligible shareholders totaled $0.68 per share, with the CAD equivalent totaling CAD 0.84 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2020, dividends declared to eligible shareholders totaled $0.57 per share, with the CAD equivalent totaling CAD 0.75 per share. Share Repurchase ProgramOn February 17, 2022, our Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up to an aggregate of $200 million of our Company's Class B common stock through March 31, 2026, with the program primarily intended to offset annual employee equity award grants. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 995,000 shares under the share repurchase program at a weighted average price of $51.70 per share, including brokerage commissions, for an aggregate value of $51.5 million.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash deposits are maintained with multiple, reputable financial institutions. Non-Cash ActivityNon-cash investing activities includes movements in our guarantee of indebtedness of certain equity method investments of $2.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 3, "Investments" for further discussion. We also had other non-cash activities related to capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid of $234.3 million, $206.6 million and $171.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we had non-cash activities related to our non-cash issuances of share-based awards. See Note 16, "Share-Based Payments" for further details.In June 2021, we rolled forward our July 2021 $250.0 million forward starting interest rate swap to May 2022 through a cashless settlement. The unrealized loss on the 2021 forward starting interest rate swap at the time of the transaction was factored into the effective interest rate assigned to the new May 2022 forward starting interest rate swap. See Note 10, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" for further details.As of December 31, 2022, we had a recorded non-cash transaction related to the establishment of an accrued liability of $56.6 million as the best estimate of the probable loss in the Keystone litigation case based on the jury verdict including associated interest. See Note 13, "Commitments and Contingencies" for further details.Other than the activity mentioned above and the supplemental non-cash activity related to the recognition of leases discussed in Note 8, "Leases," there was no other significant non-cash activity in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Accounts Receivable and Notes ReceivableWe record accounts and notes receivable at net realizable value. This carrying value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts and notes receivable balances. We calculate this allowance based on our country-specific history of write-offs, level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with and the economic status of our customers, which may be impacted by current macroeconomic and regulatory factors specific to the country of origin. This methodology takes into consideration historical loss experience and current and forecasted changes in cash flows based on internal and external information. InventoriesInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. We regularly assess the shelf-life of our inventories and reserve for those inventories when it becomes apparent the product will not be sold within our freshness specifications. In addition, we reserve for those inventories associated with discontinued SKUs or instances where we change our packaging. Other current assetsOther current assets include prepaid assets, implementation costs incurred on cloud computing arrangements, maintenance and operating supplies, promotion materials and derivative assets that are expected to be recognized or realized within the next 12 months. Maintenance and operating supplies include our inventories of spare parts, which are kept on hand for repairs and maintenance of machinery and equipment. The majority of spare parts within our business include motors, fillers and other components that are required to maintain a normal level of production in the event that expected maintenance and/or repairs are required. These parts are inventoried within current assets as they are reasonably expected to be used during the normal operating cycle of the business and are reserved for excess and obsolescence, as appropriate. The allowance for obsolete supplies was $19.8 million and $18.3 million as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.PropertiesProperties are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are reviewed periodically and have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: 20-40 years; production and office equipment 3-25 years; and software: 3-5 years. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Costs of enhancements or modifications that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated accordingly. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Our asset groups are generally identified at the segment level with the exception of certain craft breweries or other locations which may operate on a more stand-alone basis, such as our Truss LP joint venture. Returnable containers are recorded at acquisition cost and consist of returnable bottles, kegs, pallets and crates that are both in our direct control within our breweries, warehouses and distribution facilities and those that we indirectly control in the market through our agreements with our customers and other brewers and for which a deposit is received. The deposits received on our returnable containers in the market are recorded as deposit liabilities, included as current liabilities within accounts payable and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We estimate that the loss, breakage and deterioration of our returnable containers is comparable to the depreciation calculated on an estimated useful life of up to 4 years for bottles, 5 years for pallets, 7 years for crates and 15 years for returnable kegs. We also own and maintain other equipment in the market related to delivery of our products to end consumers, for example on-premise dispense equipment and refrigeration units. This equipment is recorded at acquisition cost and depreciated over lives of up to 7 years, depending on the market, reflecting the use of the equipment, as well as the loss and deterioration of the asset.The costs of acquiring or developing internal-use computer software, including directly-related payroll costs for internal resources, are capitalized and classified within properties. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred. Implementation costs incurred in hosting arrangements that are service contracts are capitalized within other assets and are not material.Properties held under finance lease are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is shorter, and the related depreciation is included in depreciation expense. Finance lease assets for which ownership is transferred at the end of the lease, or there is a purchase option that we are reasonably certain to exercise, are amortized over the useful life that would be assigned if the asset were owned.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. As of the date of the completion of our 2022 impairment testing, we have concluded that we have two reporting units, Americas and EMEA&APAC. See further discussion in Note 6, "Goodwill and Intangibles."As required, we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill at the reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that may indicate potential impairment. Our annual test is performed as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, October 1. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets uses estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions along with changes in operating performance. The evaluation involves comparing the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds its respective carrying value, then we conclude that no impairment has occurred. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit or balance of the respective indefinite-lived intangible asset. We continuously monitor the performance of our other definite-lived intangible assets and evaluate for impairment when evidence exists that certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. Definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets as this approximates the pattern in which the assets economic benefits are consumed. Goodwill impairments are recorded to the "Goodwill impairment" line item on the consolidated statement of operations whereas impairments of intangible assets are recorded in the "Other operating income (expense), net" line item.Equity Method InvestmentsWe apply the equity method of accounting to investments that we do not control but where we exercise significant influence or VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We use the cumulative earnings approach for determining cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investments. Distributions received are included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities, unless the cumulative distributions exceed our portion of the cumulative equity in the net earnings of the equity method investment, in which case the excess distributions are deemed to be returns of the investment and are classified as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note 3, "Investments" for further information regarding our equity method investments. There are no related parties that own interests in our equity method investments as of December 31, 2022.Derivative Hedging InstrumentsWe use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange, commodity prices, production and packaging material costs and for other strategic purposes related to our core business. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize our derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value and classify them in either current or non-current assets or liabilities based on each contract's respective unrealized gain or loss position and each contract's respective maturity. Our policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis, without regard to counterparty master netting agreements or similar arrangements. Further, our current derivative agreements do not allow us to net positions with the same counterparty and therefore, we present our derivative positions gross in our consolidated balance sheets.Changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow and net investment hedges are recorded in OCI, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the underlying hedged item or the sale of the underlying net investment, respectively. Effective cash flow hedges offset the gains or losses recognized on the underlying exposure in the consolidated statements of operations, or for net investment hedges, the foreign exchange translation gain or loss recognized in AOCI. Changes in fair value of outstanding fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged item are recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of the derivative attributable to components allowed to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the hedge. We record realized gains and losses from derivative instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Changes in unrealized gains and losses for derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recorded directly in earnings each period and are also recorded in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Cash flows from the settlement of derivatives, including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships, appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged item unless the instruments are deemed to contain an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case the cash flows related to this instrument will be classified as financing activities.In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we do not record the fair value of derivatives for which we have elected the Normal Purchase Normal Sale ("NPNS") exemption. We account for these contracts on an accrual basis, recording realized settlements related to these contracts in the same financial statement line items as the corresponding transaction.LeasesWe enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-owned assets, primarily real estate and equipment, which are evaluated as finance or operating leases upon commencement and are accounted for accordingly. Specifically, under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 842, Leases, a contract is or contains a lease when, (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) the customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and directs how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. For all contractual arrangements deemed to be leases (other than short-term leases, which have a duration of one year or less), as of the lease commencement date, we recognize on the consolidated balance sheet a liability for our obligation related to the lease and a corresponding asset representing our right to use the underlying asset over the period of use. For leases that qualify as short-term leases, we have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, to not apply the balance sheet recognition requirements of ASC 842, and instead, we recognize the lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have also made the election, for our existing real estate and equipment classes of underlying assets, to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to approximately 16 years. Certain of our lease agreements contain options to extend or early terminate the agreement. The lease term used to calculate the right-of-use ("ROU") asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impacts of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. When determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement, we consider various existing economic factors, including real estate strategies, the nature, length and terms of the agreement, as well as the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Based on these determinations, we generally conclude that the exercise of renewal options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement. Assumptions made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events requiring a lease modification. Additionally, for certain equipment leases involving groups of similar leased assets with similar lease terms, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities.The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future minimum lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate relative to the leased asset in all other cases.Certain of our leases include variable payments, primarily for items such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. These variable payments are excluded from the measurement of our lease assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.Lease-related expense is recorded within either cost of goods sold or MG&A expenses on the consolidated statements of operations, depending on the function of the underlying leased asset, with the exception of interest on finance lease liabilities, which is recorded within interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Pension and Postretirement BenefitsWe maintain retirement plans for the majority of our employees. We offer different types of plans within each segment, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and OPEB plans. Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. Our equity investments, BRI and BDL, maintain defined benefit, defined contribution and OPEB plans as well. We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension and OPEB plan as an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The funded status of a plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, and the related net periodic pension cost are calculated using a number of significant actuarial assumptions. Changes in net periodic pension cost and funding status may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions.We use the fair value approach to calculate the market-related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic pension cost, which includes measuring the market-related value of plan assets at fair value for purposes of determining the expected return on plan assets and amount of gain or loss subject to amortization. Projected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the measurement date of all benefits attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date using assumptions as to future compensation levels and years of service if the plan benefit formula is based on those future compensation levels and years of service. Accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or unvested) attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensation, if applicable, prior to that date. Accumulated benefit obligation differs from projected benefit obligation in that it includes no assumption about future compensation levels and years of service.We employ the corridor approach for determining each plan's potential amortization from AOCI of deferred gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from estimates, into our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. This approach defines the "corridor" as the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or 10% of the market-related value of plan assets and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants. For plans closed to new entrants and the future accrual of benefits, the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants (including retirees) is used. Fair Value MeasurementsThe carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value as recorded due to the short-term nature of these instruments. In addition, the carrying amounts of our trade loan receivables, net of allowances, approximate fair value. The fair value of derivatives is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows utilizing observable market interest, foreign exchange and commodity rates adjusted for non-performance credit risk associated with our counterparties (assets) or with MCBC (liabilities), as appropriate. See Note 10, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" for additional information. Based on current market rates for similar instruments, the fair value of long-term debt is presented in Note 9, "Debt."U.S. GAAP guidance for fair value includes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). Our financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy.The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:Level 1—Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.Level 2—Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).Level 3—Unobservable inputs that reflect the assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. We develop these inputs based on the best information available, including our own data.Foreign Currency Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies that are the functional currencies for the respective operations are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are reported as a separate component of OCI. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings for the period. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective period throughout the year.Subsequent Events On February 20, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, to be paid on March 17, 2023, to shareholders of Class A and Class B common stock of record on March 3, 2023. Shareholders of exchangeable shares will receive the CAD equivalent of dividends declared on Class A and Class B common stock.

Accounting Standards Update and Change in Accounting Principle [Abstract]
New Accounting Pronouncements New Accounting PronouncementsNew Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In March 2020, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform and was effective for all entities upon issuance on March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, defers the expiration date of Topic 848 to December 31, 2024 to realign with the revised cessation date for LIBOR. The guidance permits a company to elect certain optional expedients and exceptions when affected by the changes in reference rate reform. We have elected to adopt optional expedients impacting our derivative instruments with maturity dates extending beyond the expected discontinuance date of LIBOR. In addition, in October 2021, we amended our revolving credit facility to replace LIBOR with designated replacement rates for any future borrowings denominated in EUR or GBP. The partial adoption of, and future elections under ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, and ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, did not and are not expected to have a material impact on our accounting policies or consolidated financial statements. We will continue to evaluate the impact of reference rate reform on our other contracts and assess the impacts of adopting incremental portions of this guidance on our financial statements.In November 2021, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to provide consistent and transparent disclosures around government assistance by requiring disclosures of the type of government assistance, our method of accounting for the government assistance and the effect on our financial statements. We adopted this guidance in our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2022. None of the programs in which we receive government assistance are individually material nor are they material in the aggregate. See Note 1, "Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for additional information on our government assistance.New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn September 2022, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to provide consistent and transparent disclosures for a buyer in a supplier finance program by requiring disclosures of key program terms, the amount of obligations that have been confirmed as valid with the finance provider that are deemed outstanding as of the end of the period, a description of the financial line item in which this unpaid balance resides and a rollforward of the obligations including the amount of obligations confirmed and paid. This guidance, with the exception of the rollforward disclosure requirement, is effective for us starting with the first quarter of 2023 and is required to be applied retrospectively. The rollforward disclosure requirement is effective for us in our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2024 and is required to be applied prospectively. While early adoption of this guidance is permitted, we plan to adopt as required with all information except for the rollforward disclosure requirement to be disclosed starting with the first quarter of 2023. We expect the guidance to have an impact on disclosures only as the guidance does not impact recognition or measurement of such programs.Other than the items noted above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective or adopted in the current year that we believe have a significant impact, or potential significant impact, to our consolidated financial statements.

(1)The EMEA&APAC goodwill balance was fully impaired during the year ended December 31, 2020. Subsequent changes in the gross carrying value of goodwill and accumulated impairment loss balances are due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which are presented net in the table above, as well as an immaterial write-off related to the disposal of our India entity in 2022.
The following table presents details of our intangible assets, other than goodwill, as of December 31, 2022:

The changes in the gross carrying amounts of intangible assets from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 are primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates, as a significant amount of intangible assets are denominated in foreign currencies.
Based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, the estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets is as follows:

Year Amount
---- ------------- -----
 (In millions)
2023 $ 204.1
2024 $ 202.7
2025 $ 202.7
2026 $ 184.2
2027 $ 119.8

Amortization expense of intangible assets was $208.1 million, $218.0 million and $220.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. This expense is primarily presented within MG&A in our consolidated statements of operations.
Annual 2022 Impairment Assessment
We completed our required annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of October 1, 2022, the first day of our fourth quarter, using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach in the determination of fair value and concluded that the carrying value of the Americas reporting unit was in excess of its fair value amount such that an impairment loss of $845.0 million was recorded to the "Goodwill impairment" line item on the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the partial impairment of the Americas reporting unit goodwill, the remaining goodwill balance related to this reporting unit is still considered to be at risk for future impairments as further discussed below. Prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we tested the recoverability of the indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets within our Americas reporting unit and concluded no impairments were noted.
The decline in the fair value of the Americas reporting unit in the current year was largely impacted by macroeconomic factors including an increase to the discount rate as a result of the recent rising interest rate environment as well as reductions in management forecasts and expectations due primarily to cost inflation pressures in the near to medium term and a softening beer market in certain markets in which we operate. Specifically, the discount rate used in developing our annual fair value estimates for the Americas reporting unit in the current year was 8.75% based on market-specific factors as compared to 8.25% used as of the October 1, 2021 annual testing date.
Due to the partial impairment charge, the reporting unit is still considered to be at risk of future impairment. We continue to focus on building on the strength of our iconic core brands, growing our above premium portfolio and expanding beyond the beer aisle. While progress has been made on this strategy, including the increasing proportion of our above premium portfolio over the last several years and the strengthening of our core brands, the growth targets included in management’s forecasted future cash flows are inherently at risk given that the strategies are still in progress. In addition, these growth targets have been
adjusted to align with current expectations of the beer industry environment and broader macroeconomic conditions such as cost inflation for certain inputs, which could continue to put pressure on achieving key margin and cash flow projections into the future. Additionally, the fair value determinations are sensitive to further unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows, macroeconomic conditions, market multiples or discount rates that could negatively impact future analyses, including the ongoing impacts of cost inflation, further increases to interest rates, and other external industry factors impacting our business. The key assumptions used to derive the estimated fair values of our reporting units represent Level 3 measurements.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The fair value of the Coors brands in the Americas, the Miller brands in the U.S., the Carling brands in the U.K. and Staropramen brands in EMEA&APAC all exceed their respective carrying values by over 15.0% as of the annual testing date and therefore are not considered at risk for potential future impairment.
We utilized Level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. An excess earnings approach is used to determine the fair values of these assets as of the testing date. The future cash flows used in the analysis are based on internal cash flow projections based on our long range plans and include significant assumptions by management as noted below.
Separately, we performed a qualitative assessment of our water rights indefinite-lived intangible assets in the U.S. to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair values of these assets were greater than their respective carrying amounts. Based on this qualitative assessment, we determined that a full quantitative analysis was not necessary.
Key Assumptions
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future, and if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that impairment charges may need to be recorded in the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, an inability to execute on our strategic initiatives or increase in costs driven by inflation or other factors that could significantly impact our immediate and long range results, a prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends, a continuation of the trend away from core brands in certain of our markets, especially in markets where our core brands represent a significant portion of the market, unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets, (ii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a global pandemic or recession), (iii) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates (iv) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital, (v) sensitivity to market multiples; and (vi) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing, distribution or sale of alcoholic beverages.
Based on known facts and circumstances, we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items, as well as related potential implications, as part of our annual assessment and incorporate them into the analyses as appropriate. These facts and circumstances are subject to change and may impact future analyses. For example, we continue to monitor the challenges within the beer industry for further weakening or additional systemic structural declines, as well as for adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions such as cost inflation and the lingering coronavirus pandemic and the potential impacts either may have on our immediate or long range results. We also continuously monitor the market inputs used in calculating our discount rates, including risk-free rates, equity premiums and our cost of debt, which could result in a meaningful change to our weighted-average cost of capital calculation, as well as the market multiples used in our impairment assessment. Substantial changes in any of these inputs could lead to a material impairment. Furthermore, increased volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, including, but not limited to, extended or future government intervention in response to inflation or the pandemic, could also result in a meaningful change to our weighted-average cost of capital calculation and other inputs used in our impairment assessment.
Annual 2021 Impairment Assessment
We completed our required annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis as of October 1, 2021 and concluded that the fair value of the Americas reporting unit was determined to be in excess of its carrying amount and no goodwill impairment charge was required. While the Americas reporting unit did not have an impairment of goodwill, it was considered to be at risk for future impairments with only 6% cushion of fair value in excess of carrying value.
We also evaluated the indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets within our Americas and EMEA&APAC reporting unit and concluded no impairments were required for our indefinite-lived assets or definite-lived intangible assets.
Definite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Regarding definite-lived assets, we continuously monitor the performance of the underlying assets for potential triggering events suggesting an impairment review should be performed. As noted above, we tested the recoverability of the indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets within our Americas reporting unit prior to the annual quantitative goodwill impairment test, with no impairment noted.
During the first quarter of 2022, we identified a triggering event related to the Truss joint venture asset group within our Americas segment and recognized an impairment loss of $28.6 million, of which $12.1 million was attributable to the noncontrolling interest. The asset group was measured at fair value primarily using a market approach with Level 3 inputs. See Note 17, "Other Operating Income (Expense), net" for further details on impairment losses recorded.
No other material triggering events were identified in either 2022 or 2021 related to definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets.

(1)We repaid our $500 million 3.5% USD notes upon maturity on May 1, 2022 using a combination of commercial paper borrowings and cash on hand.
(2)On May 3, 2012, we issued approximately $1.9 billion of senior notes with portions maturing in 2017, 2022 and 2042. The issuance resulted in total proceeds, before expenses, of approximately $1.9 billion, net of underwriting fees and discounts of $14.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Approximately $1.1 billion of senior notes remained outstanding as of December 31, 2022, and the total remaining debt issuance costs capitalized in connection with these notes, including the underwriting fees and discounts, were $8.7 million and are being amortized over the term of the 2042 notes.
(3)On July 7, 2016, MCBC issued approximately $5.3 billion senior notes with portions maturing from July 15, 2019 through July 15, 2046 ("2016 USD Notes"). Approximately $3.8 billion remained outstanding as of December 31, 2022. At the same time in 2016, MCBC also issued EUR 800 million senior notes maturing July 15, 2024 ("2016 EUR Notes"), and Molson Coors International L.P., completed a private placement of CAD 1.0 billion senior notes maturing July 15, 2023 and July 15, 2026 ("2016 CAD Notes"). All senior notes were issued in order to partially fund the financing of the Acquisition (2016 USD Notes, 2016 EUR Notes and 2016 CAD Notes, collectively, the "2016 Notes"). Debt issuance costs capitalized in connection with these notes including underwriting fees, discounts and other financing related costs, were $31 million as of December 31, 2022 and are being amortized over the respective and remaining terms of the 2016 Notes.
(4)We entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate volatility for a 10-year period until they were settled on September 18, 2015. We are amortizing a portion of the resulting loss from AOCI to interest expense over the remaining term of the 2016 CAD Notes, as defined above, up to the full 10-year term of the interest rate swap agreements. The amortizing loss resulted in an increase in our effective cost of borrowing compared to the stated coupon rates by 0.6% on the 2016 CAD Notes. See Note 10, "Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" for further details on the forward starting interest rate swaps.
(5) As of December 31, 2022, we had $15.9 million in bank overdrafts and $49.7 million in bank cash related to our cross-border, cross-currency cash pool for a net positive position of $33.8 million. As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.0 million in bank overdrafts and $123.1 million in bank cash related to our cross-border, cross-currency cash pool for a net positive position of $120.1 million.
The JPY facilities were early terminated in the first quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.9 million of outstanding borrowings under our JPY facilities. In addition, we have CAD, GBP and USD overdraft facilities under which we had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.
A summary of our short-term facility availability is presented below. See Note 13, "Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion related to letters of credit.
•CAD unlimited overdraft facility at CAD Prime plus 0.50%
•GBP 10 million overdraft facility at GBP base rate plus 2.25%
•USD 10 million overdraft facility at USD Prime plus 5%
Debt Fair Value Measurements
We utilize market approaches to estimate the fair value of certain outstanding borrowings by discounting anticipated future cash flows derived from the contractual terms of the obligations and observable market interest and foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of our outstanding long-term debt (including current portion of long-term debt) was approximately $5.9 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively. The decline in the fair value of our debt was primarily driven by rising interest rates, lower notional outstanding and foreign currency impacts. All senior notes are valued based on significant observable inputs and classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of all other outstanding long-term borrowings and our short-term borrowings approximate their fair values and are also classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper
We maintain a $1.5 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of July 7, 2024 that also allows us to issue a maximum aggregate amount of $1.5 billion in commercial paper or make other borrowings at any time at variable interest rates. We use this financing from time to time to leverage cash needs including debt repayments. During 2022, we utilized borrowings from this facility in order to fund the repayment of debt upon maturity, for working capital and for general purposes. We had no borrowings drawn on this revolving credit facility and no commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Debt Covenants
Under the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include customary events of default and specified representations, warranties and covenants, as well as covenants that restrict our ability to incur certain additional priority indebtedness (certain thresholds of secured consolidated net tangible assets), certain leverage threshold percentages, create or permit liens on assets, and restrictions on mergers, acquisitions, and certain types of sale lease-back transactions.
 The maximum leverage ratio as of December 31, 2022 is 4.00x net debt to EBITDA (as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement), through maturity of the credit facility. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions and covenants, have met such financial ratios, and have met all debt payment obligations. All of our outstanding senior notes as of December 31, 2022 rank pari-passu.
As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate principal debt maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, for the next 5 years are as follows:

Year Amount

The cumulative translation adjustments related to our net investment hedges remain in AOCI until the respective underlying net investment is sold or liquidated. During the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, we did not reclassify any amounts related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings.
We expect net gains of approximately $2 million (pretax) recorded in AOCI as of December 31, 2022 will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. For derivatives designated in cash flow hedge relationships, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged as of December 31, 2022 is approximately 3 years, as well as those related to our forecasted debt issuances in 2026.

(1)The pension settlement charge recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of a settlement loss of $8.0 million that was recorded as a result of the annuity purchase for a certain Canadian pension plan described above, partially offset by a settlement gain of $5.3 million that was recorded as a result of the annuity purchase for a portion of our U.S. qualified pension plan described above.
The pension settlement charge recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to lump sum distributions allowed for under the U.K. pension plan being in excess of interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2021. Lower interest cost was primarily a result of lower interest rates as of December 31, 2020, which were used to establish the 2021 periodic pension cost, compared to prior years.

The accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was approximately $3.0 billion and $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $42.5 million increase in our underfunded status of our aggregate pension and OPEB plans from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the increase in discount rates from the prior year and the unfavorable asset returns experienced by our funded plans.
As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, certain defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. were overfunded as a result of our ongoing de-risking strategy. Information for our defined benefit pension plans that had aggregate accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets is as follows:

Assumptions
Periodic pension and OPEB cost is actuarially calculated annually for each individual plan based on data available and assumptions made at the beginning of each year. Assumptions used in the calculation include the discount rate selected and disclosed at the end of the previous year as well as other assumptions detailed in the table below. The weighted-average rates used in determining the periodic pension and OPEB cost for the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

Benefit obligations are actuarially calculated annually at the end of each year based on the assumptions detailed in the table below. Obligations under the OPEB plans are determined by the application of the terms of medical, dental, vision and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and heath care cost trend rates. The weighted-average rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation for defined pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for OPEB plans, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, were as follows.

(7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced.

We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material variable payment provisions or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense was $121 million for fiscal 2022 and $119 million for both fiscal 2021 and 2020. We recognized operating lease expense in cost of revenue and operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...

(7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...

[' OCI. Additionally, when we do not have the expectation or intent to cash settle certain of our intercompany note receivable and note payable positions in the foreseeable future, the remeasurement of these instruments is recorded as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments within OCI. We release stranded tax effects from AOCI using either a specific identification approach or portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item. Earnings Per ShareBasic EPS is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the additional dilutive effect of our potentially dilutive securities, which include RSUs, DSUs, PSUs and stock options. The dilutive effects of our potentially dilutive securities are calculated using the treasury stock method. Our calculation of weighted-average shares includes Class A common stock and Class B common stock and Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares. All classes of stock have in effect the same dividend rights and share equitably in undistributed earnings. Holders of Class A common stock receive dividends only to the extent dividends are declared and paid to holders of Class B common stock. See Note 14, "]:

As of December 31, 2022, construction in progress also includes $2.18 billion of servers and network assets components stored by our suppliers until required by our design manufacturers to fulfill certain purchase orders. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $8.50 billion, $7.56 billion, and $6.39 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The majority of the property and equipment depreciation expense was from servers and network assets depreciation of $5.29 billion, $4.94 billion, and $4.38 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful life of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $1.34 billion abandonment charge and $508 million impairment loss for data center assets and leasehold improvements assets, respectively, as a result of our restructuring efforts. For additional information, see Note 3 -- Restructuring.

[") method. We regularly assess the shelf-life of our inventories and reserve for those inventories when it becomes apparent the product will not be sold within our freshness specifications. In addition, we reserve for those inventories associated with discontinued SKUs or instances where we change our packaging. Other current assetsOther current assets include prepaid assets, implementation costs incurred on cloud computing arrangements, maintenance and operating supplies, promotion materials and derivative assets that are expected to be recognized or realized within the next 12 months. Maintenance and operating supplies include our inventories of spare parts, which are kept on hand for repairs and maintenance of machinery and equipment. The majority of spare parts within our business include motors, fillers and other components that are required to maintain a normal level of production in the event that expected maintenance and/or repairs are required. These parts are inventoried within current assets as they are reasonably expected to be used during the normal operating cycle of the business and are reserved for excess and obsolescence, as appropriate. The allowance for obsolete supplies was $19.8 million and $18.3 million as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively.PropertiesProperties are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are reviewed periodically and have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: 20-40 years; production and office equipment 3-25 years; and software: 3-5 years. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Costs of enhancements or modifications that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated accordingly. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Our asset groups are generally identified at the segment level with the exception of certain craft breweries or other locations which may operate on a more stand-alone basis, such as our Truss LP joint venture. Returnable containers are recorded at acquisition cost and consist of returnable bottles, kegs, pallets and crates that are both in our direct control within our breweries, warehouses and distribution facilities and those that we indirectly control in the market through our agreements with our customers and other brewers and for which a deposit is received. The deposits received on our returnable containers in the market are recorded as deposit liabilities, included as current liabilities within accounts payable and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. We estimate that the loss, breakage and deterioration of our returnable containers is comparable to the depreciation calculated on an estimated useful life of up to 4 years for bottles, 5 years for pallets, 7 years for crates and 15 years for returnable kegs. We also own and maintain other equipment in the market related to delivery of our products to end consumers, for example on-premise dispense equipment and refrigeration units. This equipment is recorded at acquisition cost and depreciated over lives of up to 7 years, depending on the market, reflecting the use of the equipment, as well as the loss and deterioration of the asset.The costs of acquiring or developing internal-use computer software, including directly-related payroll costs for internal resources, are capitalized and classified within properties. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred. Implementation costs incurred in hosting arrangements that are service contracts are capitalized within other assets and are not material.Properties held under finance lease are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is shorter, and the related depreciation is included in depreciation expense. Finance lease assets for which ownership is transferred at the end of the lease, or there is a purchase option that we are reasonably certain to exercise, are amortized over the useful life that would be assigned if the asset were owned.Goodwill and Other Intangible AssetsGoodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. As of the date of the completion of our 2022 impairment testing, we have concluded that we have two reporting units, Americas and EMEA&APAC. See further discussion in Note 6, "]:

[" as the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or 10% of the market-related value of plan assets and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants. For plans closed to new entrants and the future accrual of benefits, the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants (including retirees) is used. Fair Value MeasurementsThe carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value as recorded due to the short-term nature of these instruments. In addition, the carrying amounts of our trade loan receivables, net of allowances, approximate fair value. The fair value of derivatives is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows utilizing observable market interest, foreign exchange and commodity rates adjusted for non-performance credit risk associated with our counterparties (assets) or with MCBC (liabilities), as appropriate.

The JPY facilities were early terminated in the first quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we had $3.9 million of outstanding borrowings under our JPY facilities. In addition, we have CAD, GBP and USD overdraft facilities under which we had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021.
A summary of our short-term facility availability is presented below. See Note 13, "]:
(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

The cumulative translation adjustments related to our net investment hedges remain in AOCI until the respective underlying net investment is sold or liquidated. During the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, we did not reclassify any amounts related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings.
We expect net gains of approximately $2 million (pretax) recorded in AOCI as of December 31, 2022 will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. For derivatives designated in cash flow hedge relationships, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged as of December 31, 2022 is approximately 3 years, as well as those related to our forecasted debt issuances in 2026.

(1)The pension settlement charge recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily consisted of a settlement loss of $8.0 million that was recorded as a result of the annuity purchase for a certain Canadian pension plan described above, partially offset by a settlement gain of $5.3 million that was recorded as a result of the annuity purchase for a portion of our U.S. qualified pension plan described above.
The pension settlement charge recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to lump sum distributions allowed for under the U.K. pension plan being in excess of interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2021. Lower interest cost was primarily a result of lower interest rates as of December 31, 2020, which were used to establish the 2021 periodic pension cost, compared to prior years.

The accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was approximately $3.0 billion and $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The $42.5 million increase in our underfunded status of our aggregate pension and OPEB plans from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the increase in discount rates from the prior year and the unfavorable asset returns experienced by our funded plans.
As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, certain defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. were overfunded as a result of our ongoing de-risking strategy. Information for our defined benefit pension plans that had aggregate accumulated benefit obligations and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets is as follows:

[" line item on the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the partial impairment of the Americas reporting unit goodwill, the remaining goodwill balance related to this reporting unit is still considered to be at risk for future impairments as further discussed below. Prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we tested the recoverability of the indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets within our Americas reporting unit and concluded no impairments were noted.
The decline in the fair value of the Americas reporting unit in the current year was largely impacted by macroeconomic factors including an increase to the discount rate as a result of the recent rising interest rate environment as well as reductions in management forecasts and expectations due primarily to cost inflation pressures in the near to medium term and a softening beer market in certain markets in which we operate. Specifically, the discount rate used in developing our annual fair value estimates for the Americas reporting unit in the current year was 8.75% based on market-specific factors as compared to 8.25% used as of the October 1, 2021 annual testing date.
Due to the partial impairment charge, the reporting unit is still considered to be at risk of future impairment. We continue to focus on building on the strength of our iconic core brands, growing our above premium portfolio and expanding beyond the beer aisle. While progress has been made on this strategy, including the increasing proportion of our above premium portfolio over the last several years and the strengthening of our core brands, the growth targets included in management’s forecasted future cash flows are inherently at risk given that the strategies are still in progress. In addition, these growth targets have been
adjusted to align with current expectations of the beer industry environment and broader macroeconomic conditions such as cost inflation for certain inputs, which could continue to put pressure on achieving key margin and cash flow projections into the future. Additionally, the fair value determinations are sensitive to further unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows, macroeconomic conditions, market multiples or discount rates that could negatively impact future analyses, including the ongoing impacts of cost inflation, further increases to interest rates, and other external industry factors impacting our business. The key assumptions used to derive the estimated fair values of our reporting units represent Level 3 measurements.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The fair value of the Coors brands in the Americas, the Miller brands in the U.S., the Carling brands in the U.K. and Staropramen brands in EMEA&APAC all exceed their respective carrying values by over 15.0% as of the annual testing date and therefore are not considered at risk for potential future impairment.
We utilized Level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. An excess earnings approach is used to determine the fair values of these assets as of the testing date. The future cash flows used in the analysis are based on internal cash flow projections based on our long range plans and include significant assumptions by management as noted below.
Separately, we performed a qualitative assessment of our water rights indefinite-lived intangible assets in the U.S. to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair values of these assets were greater than their respective carrying amounts. Based on this qualitative assessment, we determined that a full quantitative analysis was not necessary.
Key Assumptions
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future, and if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that impairment charges may need to be recorded in the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, an inability to execute on our strategic initiatives or increase in costs driven by inflation or other factors that could significantly impact our immediate and long range results, a prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends, a continuation of the trend away from core brands in certain of our markets, especially in markets where our core brands represent a significant portion of the market, unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully achieve our cost savings targets, (ii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or an economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a global pandemic or recession), (iii) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates (iv) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital, (v) sensitivity to market multiples; and (vi) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing, distribution or sale of alcoholic beverages.
Based on known facts and circumstances, we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items, as well as related potential implications, as part of our annual assessment and incorporate them into the analyses as appropriate. These facts and circumstances are subject to change and may impact future analyses. For example, we continue to monitor the challenges within the beer industry for further weakening or additional systemic structural declines, as well as for adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions such as cost inflation and the lingering coronavirus pandemic and the potential impacts either may have on our immediate or long range results. We also continuously monitor the market inputs used in calculating our discount rates, including risk-free rates, equity premiums and our cost of debt, which could result in a meaningful change to our weighted-average cost of capital calculation, as well as the market multiples used in our impairment assessment. Substantial changes in any of these inputs could lead to a material impairment. Furthermore, increased volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, including, but not limited to, extended or future government intervention in response to inflation or the pandemic, could also result in a meaningful change to our weighted-average cost of capital calculation and other inputs used in our impairment assessment.
Annual 2021 Impairment Assessment
We completed our required annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis as of October 1, 2021 and concluded that the fair value of the Americas reporting unit was determined to be in excess of its carrying amount and no goodwill impairment charge was required. While the Americas reporting unit did not have an impairment of goodwill, it was considered to be at risk for future impairments with only 6% cushion of fair value in excess of carrying value.
We also evaluated the indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets within our Americas and EMEA&APAC reporting unit and concluded no impairments were required for our indefinite-lived assets or definite-lived intangible assets.
Definite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Regarding definite-lived assets, we continuously monitor the performance of the underlying assets for potential triggering events suggesting an impairment review should be performed. As noted above, we tested the recoverability of the indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets within our Americas reporting unit prior to the annual quantitative goodwill impairment test, with no impairment noted.
During the first quarter of 2022, we identified a triggering event related to the Truss joint venture asset group within our Americas segment and recognized an impairment loss of $28.6 million, of which $12.1 million was attributable to the noncontrolling interest. The asset group was measured at fair value primarily using a market approach with Level 3 inputs. See Note 17, "]:
