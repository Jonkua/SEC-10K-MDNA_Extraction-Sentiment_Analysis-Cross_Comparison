ITEM 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an understanding and assessment of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Ventas, Inc. You should read this discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and our Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.

Business Summary and Overview of 2022

Ventas, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and other similar terms), an S&P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) operating at the intersection of healthcare and real estate. We hold a highly diversified portfolio of senior housing communities, medical office buildings (“MOBs”), life science, research and innovation centers, hospitals and other healthcare facilities, which we generally refer to collectively as “healthcare real estate,” located throughout the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or had investments in approximately 1,300 properties (including properties classified as held for sale). Our company was originally founded in 1983 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.

We primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of healthcare real estate assets through wholly owned subsidiaries and other co-investment entities. We operate through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, senior housing operating portfolio, which we also refer to as “SHOP” and which was formerly known as senior living operations, and office operations. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes, including “Note 2 – Accounting Policies” and “Note 18 – Segment Information,” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our senior housing communities are either subject to triple-net leases, in which case they are included in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, or operated by independent third-party managers, in which case they are included in our SHOP reportable business segment.

We have a third-party institutional capital management business, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”), which includes our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund (the “Ventas Fund”). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in healthcare real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner.

We aim to enhance shareholder value by delivering consistent, superior total returns through a strategy of (1) generating reliable and growing cash flows, (2) maintaining a balanced, diversified portfolio of high-quality assets and (3) preserving our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity.

Our ability to access capital in a timely and cost-effective manner is critical to the success of our business strategy because it affects our ability to satisfy existing obligations, including the repayment of maturing indebtedness, and to make future investments. Factors such as general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our securities, expectations of our potential future earnings and cash distributions, and the trading price of our common stock impact our access to and cost of external capital. For that reason, we generally attempt to match the long-term duration of our investments in real property with long-term financing through the issuance of shares of our common stock or the incurrence of long-term fixed rate debt.

Starting in 2020, our business was significantly impacted by both the COVID-19 pandemic itself, including actions taken to prevent the spread of the virus and its variants, and its extended consequences. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and “Note 2 – Accounting Policies - COVID-19 Assessment” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, in each case, of this Annual Report.

Select 2022 Highlights

Investments and Dispositions

•During the year ended December 31, 2022, for an aggregate purchase price of $453.2 million, we acquired 18 MOBs leased to affiliates of Ardent, one behavioral health center, one research and innovation center (all of which are reported within our office operations segment) and two senior housing communities (which are reported within our SHOP segment).

43

•During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold seven senior housing communities, two MOBs, three triple-net leased properties, one vacant land parcel and one vacant office building for aggregate consideration of $115.1 million and recognized a net gain on the sale of these assets of $7.8 million in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

•In 2022, we provided secured debt financing in the aggregate amount of $29.1 million with terms ranging from two to five years and interest rates ranging from Term SOFR plus 3.75% to 5.00%.

Liquidity and Capital

•As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2.4 billion in liquidity, including availability under our revolving credit facility and cash and cash equivalents on hand, with $403.0 million borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and modest near-term debt maturing.

•In June 2022, we entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) with Ventas Realty, as borrower. The New Credit Agreement replaces Ventas Realty’s previous $200.0 million unsecured term loan priced at LIBOR plus 0.90% that matured in 2023 with a new $500.0 million unsecured term loan that matures in 2027 and is initially priced at Term SOFR plus 0.95% based on Ventas Realty’s debt ratings.

•In 2022, all three credit rating agencies took positive rating actions by upgrading Ventas’ long-term outlook to stable and affirmed its BBB+ or equivalent ratings.

•As of December 31, 2022, we have $1.0 billion remaining under our “at-the-market” equity offering program (“ATM program”), under which we may sell up to $1.0 billion aggregate gross sales price of shares of our common stock.

Portfolio

•We successfully transitioned the operations of 90 senior living communities owned by us and operated under management agreements with Eclipse Senior Living, Inc. (“ESL”) to seven experienced managers on or before January 2, 2022. ESL ceased operation of its management business in early 2022 following completion of the transitions. We incurred certain one-time transition costs and expenses in connection with the transitions, which were recognized within transaction expenses and deal costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Environmental, Social and Governance

•During 2022, we continued our leadership in ESG, receiving numerous recognitions and accolades, including the 2022 Nareit Health Care “Leader in the Light” award for a sixth consecutive year, the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year, the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the fourth consecutive year, the CDP “A List” for climate change in 2021, earning a 4-star GRESB rating for the tenth consecutive year, and named a 2022 ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year for the second consecutive year.

Other Items

•During the fourth quarter, Atria Senior Living, Inc. (“Atria”) combined its proprietary cloud-based senior housing management software platform, Glennis, with two other complementary companies in the Software as a Service (SaaS) technology space. The merger transaction was executed under the sponsorship and majority ownership of an experienced private equity technology investor. We own a 34% stake in Atria and recognized a $26.1 million gain on sale in the fourth quarter of 2022 in income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We now own nearly 10% of the new combined SaaS company.

•We earned our first promote revenue of $9.9 million as general partner of the Ventas Fund within VIM. The promote revenue was recorded in third party capital management revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

•We continued expanding our life science, research and innovation footprint, as evidenced by $0.7 billion in closed or committed projects in 2022. The 643,000 square foot, $425 million Atrium Health/Wake Forest University School of Medicine development in Charlotte announced in 2022 exemplifies our ability to leverage strong relationships with leaders in research, medicine and higher education to execute on high-quality, large-scale transactions.

44

•During the year ended December 31, 2022, we received $54.2 million and $10.5 million in HHS and other government grants, respectively, which are primarily recognized as a contra expense within property-level operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which they were received.

•In December 2022, we recognized $11.7 million in income from unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Income relating to our share of a net gain on real estate disposition recognized by Ardent.

•We hold a 9.8% ownership interest in Ardent, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, as well as the right to appoint one member to the Ardent Board of Directors. In September 2022, Ardent’s majority equity owner entered into a definitive purchase agreement to sell a minority equity investment in Ardent to a third-party investor. We have the right to, and have elected to, participate in the proposed transaction by selling approximately 24% of our ownership interest to the third-party investor on the same terms. If the proposed transaction is consummated, our ownership interest in Ardent would be reduced. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and we cannot assure you that the transaction will close.

•During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $12.5 million of expenses relating to materially disruptive events, primarily clean-up costs associated with winter storm Elliott.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the critical accounting policies described below, among others, affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, see “Note 2 – Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and the joint venture entities over which we exercise control. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation, and our net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.

GAAP requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; and (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity’s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. We consolidate our investment in a VIE when we determine that we are its primary beneficiary. We may change our original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affects the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.

We identify the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. We perform this analysis on an ongoing basis.

45

Accounting for Real Estate Acquisitions

When we acquire real estate, we first make reasonable judgments about whether the transaction involves an asset or a business. Our real estate acquisitions are generally accounted for as asset acquisitions as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. Regardless of whether an acquisition is considered a business combination or an asset acquisition, we record the cost of the businesses or assets acquired as tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.

We estimate the fair value of buildings acquired on an as-if-vacant basis or replacement cost basis and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building, generally not to exceed 35 years. We determine the fair value of other fixed assets, such as site improvements and furniture, fixtures and equipment, based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over the assets’ estimated remaining useful lives as determined at the applicable acquisition date. We determine the value of land either by considering the sales prices of similar properties in recent transactions or based on internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio. We generally determine the value of construction in progress based upon the replacement cost. However, for certain acquired properties that are part of a ground-up development, we determine fair value by using the same valuation approach as for all other properties and deducting the estimated cost to complete the development. During the remaining construction period, we capitalize project costs until the development has reached substantial completion. Construction in progress, including capitalized interest, is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion.

Intangibles primarily include the value of in-place leases and acquired lease contracts. We include all lease-related intangible assets and liabilities within acquired lease intangibles and accounts payable and other liabilities, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The fair value of acquired lease-related intangibles, if any, reflects: (i) the estimated value of any above or below market leases, determined by discounting the difference between the estimated market rent and in-place lease rent; and (ii) the estimated value of in-place leases related to the cost to obtain tenants, including leasing commissions, and an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rent and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period as if the acquired space was vacant. We amortize any acquired lease-related intangibles to revenue or amortization expense over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any assumed bargain renewal periods. If a lease is terminated prior to its stated expiration or not renewed upon expiration, we recognize all unamortized amounts of lease-related intangibles associated with that lease in operations over the shortened lease term.

We estimate the fair value of purchase option intangible assets and liabilities, if any, by discounting the difference between the applicable property’s acquisition date fair value and an estimate of its future option price. We do not amortize the resulting intangible asset or liability over the term of the lease, but rather adjust the recognized value of the asset or liability upon sale.

In connection with an acquisition, we may assume rights and obligations under certain lease agreements pursuant to which we become the lessee of a given property. We generally assume the lease classification previously determined by the prior lessee absent a modification in the assumed lease agreement. We assess assumed operating leases, including ground leases, to determine whether the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us given current market conditions on the acquisition date. To the extent the lease terms are favorable or unfavorable to us relative to market conditions on the acquisition date, we recognize an intangible asset or liability at fair value and amortize that asset or liability to interest or rental expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income over the applicable lease term. Where we are the lessee, we record the acquisition date values of leases, including any above or below market value, within operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We estimate the fair value of noncontrolling interests assumed consistent with the manner in which we value all of the underlying assets and liabilities.

We calculate the fair value of long-term assumed debt by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings, which we approximate based on the rate at which we would expect to incur a replacement instrument on the date of acquisition, and recognize any fair value adjustments related to long-term debt as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument.

46

Impairment of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily consisting of investments in real estate, for impairment indicators. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations. In performing this evaluation, we consider market conditions and our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the asset. We adjust the net book value of real estate properties and other long-lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows, including sales proceeds, is less than book value. We recognize an impairment loss at the time we make any such determination.

Estimates of fair value used in our evaluation of investments in real estate are based upon discounted future cash flow projections, if necessary, or other acceptable valuation techniques that are based, in turn, upon all available evidence including level three inputs, such as revenue and expense growth rates, estimates of future cash flows, capitalization rates, discount rates, general economic conditions and trends, or other available market data such as replacement cost or comparable sales. Our ability to accurately predict future operating results and cash flows and to estimate and determine fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments. While we believe our assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our financial results.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In November 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-10, Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance (“ASU 2021-10”), which requires expanded annual disclosures for transactions involving the receipt of government assistance. Required disclosures include a description of the nature of the transactions with government entities, our accounting policies for such transactions and their impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We adopted ASU 2021-10 on January 1, 2022 and the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Results of Operations

As of December 31, 2022, we operated through three reportable business segments: triple-net leased properties, SHOP and office operations. In our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, we invest in and own senior housing and healthcare properties throughout the United States and the United Kingdom and lease those properties to healthcare operating companies under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses. In our SHOP reportable business segment, we invest in senior housing communities throughout the United States and Canada and engage independent operators, such as Atria and Sunrise, to manage those communities. In our office operations reportable business segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage MOBs and life science, research and innovation centers throughout the United States. Information provided for “non-segment” includes income from loans and investments and other miscellaneous income and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. Assets included in “non-segment” consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments, and miscellaneous accounts receivable.

Our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each reportable business segment and determines how to allocate resources to those segments, in significant part, based on NOI and related measures for each segment. For further information regarding our reportable business segments and a discussion of our definition of NOI, see “Note 18 – Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI.

Total communities 544 545 80.8 % 78.5 % $ 4,396 $ 4,489

Resident fees and services include all amounts earned from residents at our senior housing communities, such as rental fees related to resident leases, extended health care fees and other ancillary service income. Property-level operating expenses related to our SHOP reportable business segment include labor, food, utilities, marketing, management and other costs of operating the properties. For senior housing communities in our SHOP reportable business segment, occupancy generally reflects average operator-reported unit occupancy for the reporting period. Average monthly revenue per occupied room reflects average resident fees and services per operator-reported occupied unit for the reporting period.

The increase in our SHOP reportable business NOI in 2022 over the prior year was driven by acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of over 100 independent living communities from New Senior Investment Inc. in September 2021, positive trends in occupancy and revenue, the transition of assets from our triple-net leased properties to our SHOP reportable business segment and higher government assistance received, partially offset by higher property-level operating expenses, driven by macro inflationary impacts primarily on labor, utilities and food costs. During 2022 and 2021, we received $54.2 million and $15.4 million, respectively, of HHS grants, which reduced property-level operating expenses in the applicable period.

The following table compares results of operations for our 307 same-store SHOP communities (dollars in thousands).

The increase in our same-store SHOP reportable business NOI is primarily driven by positive trends in occupancy and revenue per occupied room as well as higher government grants received, which are reflected as a reduction in property-level operating expenses, partially offset by higher property-level operating expenses, driven by macro inflationary impacts primarily on labor, utilities and food costs. During 2022 and 2021, we received $40.5 million and $9.1 million, respectively, of HHS grants, which reduced property-level operating expenses in the applicable period.

NOI $ 582,853 $ 638,488 $ (55,635) (8.7) %

In our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, our revenues generally consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to contractual escalations) received from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms. We report revenues and property-level operating expenses within our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment for real estate tax and insurance expenses that are paid from escrows collected from our tenants.

The decrease in our triple-net leased properties NOI in 2022 over the prior year was primarily driven by a $41.9 million reduction in rental income from communities that were transitioned to our senior housing operating portfolio and a $8.4 million reduction attributable to rental income from communities that were sold, partially offset by contractual rent escalators.

Occupancy rates may affect the profitability of our tenants’ operations. For senior housing communities and post-acute properties in our triple-net leased properties reportable business segment, occupancy generally reflects average operator-reported unit and bed occupancy, respectively, for the reporting period. Because triple-net financials are delivered to us following the reporting period, occupancy is reported in arrears. The following table sets forth average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at December 31, 2022 and measured over the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2022 (which is the most recent information available to us from our tenants) and average continuing occupancy rates related to the triple-net leased properties we owned at December 31, 2021 and measured over the 12 months ended September 30, 2021. The table excludes non-stabilized properties, properties owned through investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, certain properties for which we do not receive occupancy information and properties acquired or properties that transitioned operators for which we do not have a full four quarters of occupancy results.

The following table compares results of operations for our 314 same-store triple-net leased properties. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures—NOI” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure regarding same-store NOI for each of our reportable business segments (dollars in thousands):

NOI $ 568,990 $ 560,601 $ 8,389 1.5 %

51

The increase in our same-store triple-net leased properties rental income in 2022 over the prior year was attributable primarily to contractual rent escalators, partially offset by lease resolutions with several smaller senior housing triple-net tenants who were materially affected by COVID-19.

NOI — Non-Segment

Information provided for non-segment NOI includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses, related to our third-party institutional capital management business, income from loans and investments and various corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments. The $18.3 million decrease in non-segment NOI in 2022 over the prior year was primarily due to $16.6 million gain recognized in 2021 for the redemption of Ardent’s senior notes and $10.7 million gain on the sale of marketable debt securities in 2021, partially offset by $9.9 million of promote revenue earned as general partner of the Ventas Fund within VIM in 2022. See “Note 6 – Loans Receivable and Investments” and “Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Entities” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Company Results

Interest and Other Income

The $11.2 million decrease in interest and other income in 2022 over the prior year is primarily due to a $13.1 million payment received in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to a fee earned when Kindred was acquired and began operating under a new healthcare system called ScionHealth. See “Note 3 – Concentration of Credit Risk” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Interest Expense

The $27.5 million increase in total interest expense in 2022 over the prior year was primarily attributable to an increase of $16.8 million due to higher debt balances as a result of acquisitions and an increase of $9.4 million due to a higher effective interest rate. Our GAAP weighted average effective interest rate was 3.66% for 2022, compared to 3.59% for 2021. Capitalized interest for 2022 and 2021 was $9.6 million and $11.3 million, respectively.

Depreciation and Amortization

The $0.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2022 over the prior year is primarily due to a $124.3 million increase in depreciation related to the over 100 independent living communities acquired from New Senior in September 2021, partially offset by $124.7 million decrease in impairments recognized in 2022 compared to 2021.

General, Administrative and Professional Fees

The $15.1 million increase in general, administrative and professional fees in 2022 over the prior year was primarily due to the inclusion of a portion of New Senior’s overhead, the return to a more normalized business environment and professional fees in 2022.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net

The $58.7 million decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt, net in 2022 over the prior year was primarily related to an aggregate $56.4 million loss recognized during 2021 in connection with the redemptions of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.10% senior notes due January 2023, $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due 2023, and $263.7 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior notes due 2022.

Transaction Expenses and Deal Costs

The $4.3 million increase in transaction expenses and deal costs in 2022 over the prior year was primarily due to costs incurred in 2022 in connection with stockholder relations matters.

52

Allowance on Loans Receivable and Investments

The $28.8 million change in allowance on loans receivable and investments was primarily due to a $20.0 million allowance recognized in 2022 on our cash-pay mezzanine loan (the “Santerre Mezzanine Loan”) to Santerre Health Investors. The Santerre Mezzanine Loan has a current principal balance of $486.1 million, is freely prepayable and is priced at LIBOR + 6.42%. This is partially offset by the reversal of certain allowances in the first quarter of 2021 due to a change in our estimate of credit losses. See “Note 2 – Accounting Policies - Fair Values of Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other

The $21.2 million increase in other expenses in 2022 over 2021 is primarily due to an increase of $24.0 million in unrealized loss as a result of a decrease in the fair value of stock warrants received in connection with the Brookdale Senior Living lease modification. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the stock warrants was $23.6 million, which was $4.4 million lower than the fair value at the grant date.

Income from Unconsolidated Entities

The $23.5 million increase in income from unconsolidated entities for 2022 over 2021 was primarily due to a $26.1 million gain on sale recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022 in connection with Atria combining its proprietary cloud-based senior housing management software platform, Glennis, with two other complementary companies in the Software as a Service (SaaS) technology space. The merger transaction was executed under the sponsorship and majority ownership of an experienced private equity technology investor. We own a 34% stake in Atria and recognized a $26.1 million gain on sale. We now own nearly 10% of the new combined SaaS company.

Gain on Real Estate Dispositions

The $211.0 million decrease in gain on real estate dispositions was due to the higher disposition volume in 2021, comprised of 34 MOBs, eight triple-net leased properties and 23 senior housing communities, which resulted in gains on sale of real estate of $218.8 million recognized in 2021 compared to gains of $7.8 million in 2022. The gain on real estate dispositions for 2022 was primarily attributable to the sale of seven senior housing communities, two MOBs, three triple-net leased properties, one vacant land parcel and one vacant office building.

Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

The 2022 income tax benefit is primarily due to a $7.5 million income tax benefit from operating losses at certain TRS entities and an income tax benefit of $11.9 million from an internal restructuring of foreign TRS entities. The 2021 income tax expense is due to a $3.5 million deferred tax expense related to an internal restructuring of certain U.S. TRS entities, $3.3 million deferred tax expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities as a result of enacted tax rate changes in the United Kingdom, and a $3.7 million deferred tax expense related to the release of certain residual tax effects from marketable debt securities.

Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020

Our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed with the SEC on February 18, 2022, contains information regarding our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the effect of changes in those results from period to period on our net income attributable to common stockholders.

53

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We consider certain non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Described below are the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

The non-GAAP financial measures we present in this Annual Report may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. You should not consider these measures as alternatives to net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of our liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. In order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results, you should examine these measures in conjunction with net income attributable to common stockholders as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Funds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders

Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, we consider Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) and Normalized FFO to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. We believe that the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses on depreciable real estate and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. We believe that Normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and our management to compare our operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies across periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, we provide information about identified non-cash components of FFO and Normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess the impact of those items on our financial results.

We use the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”) definition of FFO. Nareit defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate property, including gain (or loss) on re-measurement of equity method investments and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests. Adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We define Normalized FFO as Nareit FFO excluding the following income and expense items, without duplication: (a) transaction expenses and deal costs, including transaction, integration and severance-related costs and expenses, and amortization of intangibles, in each case net of noncontrolling interests’ share of these items and including Ventas’ share of these items from unconsolidated entities; (b) the impact of expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of our debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to our executive equity compensation plan, derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on our Consolidated Statements of Income and non-cash charges related to leases; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) net expenses or recoveries related to materially disruptive events; and (h) other items set forth in the Normalized FFO reconciliation included herein.

54

The following table summarizes our FFO and Normalized FFO for the three years ended December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands). The increase in Normalized FFO for the year ended December 31, 2022 over the prior year is due to increased net operating income at our SHOP reportable business segment as a result of increased revenues, partially offset by higher property-level operating expenses; accretive acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of over 100 independent living communities from New Senior; partially offset by higher interest expense, lease resolutions with several smaller senior housing triple-net tenants who were materially affected by COVID-19 and dispositions in 2021.

NOI

We also consider NOI an important supplemental measure because it allows investors, analysts and our management to assess our unlevered property-level operating results and to compare our operating results with those of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis. We define NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third party capital management expenses.

See “Results of Operations” for discussions regarding both NOI and same-store NOI. We define same-store as properties owned, consolidated and operational for the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded; provided, however, that we may include selected properties that otherwise meet the same-store criteria if they are included in substantially all of, but not a full, period for one or both of the comparison periods, and in our judgment such inclusion provides a more meaningful presentation of our segment performance.

Newly acquired development properties and recently developed or redeveloped properties in our SHOP reportable business segment will be included in same-store once they are stabilized for the full period in both periods presented. These properties are considered stabilized upon the earlier of (a) the achievement of 80% sustained occupancy or (b) 24 months from the date of acquisition or substantial completion of work. Recently developed or redeveloped properties in our office operations and triple-net leased properties reportable business segment segments will be included in same-store once substantial completion of work has occurred for the full period in both periods presented. Our senior housing operating portfolio and triple-net leased properties that have undergone operator or business model transitions will be included in same-store once operating under consistent operating structures for the full period in both periods presented.

Properties are excluded from same-store if they are: (i) sold, classified as held for sale or properties whose operations were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with GAAP; (ii) impacted by materially disruptive events such as flood or fire; (iii) for SHOP, those properties that are currently undergoing a materially disruptive redevelopment; (iv) for our office operations and triple-net leased properties reportable business segments, those properties for which management has an intention to institute, or has instituted, a redevelopment plan because the properties may require major property-level expenditures to maximize value, increase NOI, or maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization, most commonly as the result of an expected or actual material change in occupancy or NOI; or (v) for SHOP and triple-net leased reportable business segments, those properties that are scheduled to undergo operator or business model transitions, or have transitioned operators or business models after the start of the prior comparison period.

To eliminate the impact of exchange rate movements, all portfolio performance-based disclosures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual

56

reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period.

Asset/Liability Management

Asset/liability management, a key element of enterprise risk management, is designed to support the achievement of our business strategy, while ensuring that we maintain appropriate and tolerable levels of market risk (primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk) and credit risk. Effective management of these risks is a contributing factor to the absolute levels and variability of our FFO and net worth. The following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities, including the use of derivative financial instruments.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured term loans, certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations, mortgage loans receivable that bear interest at floating rates and available for sale securities. These market risks result primarily from changes in LIBOR, SOFR rates or prime rates. To manage these risks, we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors, including our assessment of current and future economic conditions. See “Risk
Factors—We are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.

The variable rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $144.2 million notional amount of interest rate swaps maturing on March 22, 2027, in each case that effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. In addition, the fixed rate debt in the table above reflects, in part, the effect of $338.0 million and C$267.8 million notional amount of interest

58

rate swaps with maturities ranging from January 2023 to April 2031, in each case that effectively convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. See “Note 10 – Senior Notes Payable and Other Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

The decrease in our fixed rate debt from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar on our senior notes denominated in Canadian dollars.

The increase in our outstanding variable rate debt at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 is primarily attributable to borrowings under our unsecured term loan and commercial paper program.

Assuming a 100 basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our variable rate debt and assuming no change in our variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2022, interest expense on an annualized basis would increase by approximately $15.0 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our joint venture partners’ aggregate share of total consolidated debt was $279.0 million and $278.0 million, respectively, with respect to certain properties we owned through consolidated joint ventures.

Total consolidated debt does not include our portion of unconsolidated debt related to investments in unconsolidated real estate entities, which was $454.4 million and $338.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The fair value of our fixed rate debt is based on current market interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings. Increases in market interest rates typically result in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates typically result in an increase in the fair value of fixed rate date. While changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, these changes do not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt. Therefore, interest rate risk does not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt obligations until their maturity or earlier prepayment and refinancing. If interest rates have risen at the time we seek to refinance our fixed rate debt, whether at maturity or otherwise, our future earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional borrowing costs. Conversely, lower interest rates at the time of refinancing may reduce our overall borrowing costs.

To highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates, the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of 100 basis points in interest rates (dollars in thousands):

----------------------------------------------- ------------------ ---------- ---- ---------- - ----------
 As of December 31,
 2022 2021
Gross book value $ 10,863,436 $ 10,990,982
Fair value 10,010,935 11,766,336
Fair value reflecting change in interest rates:
-100 basis points 10,449,991 12,437,306
+100 basis points 9,607,787 11,164,150

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of our secured and non-mortgage loans receivable, based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans, was $517.0 million and $498.0 million, respectively. See “Note 6 – Loans Receivable and Investments” and “Note 11 – Fair Values of Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

As a result of our Canadian and United Kingdom operations, we are subject to fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and operating performance. Based solely on our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 (including the impact of existing hedging arrangements), if the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound and Canadian dollar were to increase or decrease by one standard deviation compared to the average exchange rate during the year, our Normalized FFO per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 would decrease or increase, as applicable, by less than $0.01 per share or 1%. We will continue to mitigate these risks through a layered approach to hedging looking out for the next year and continual assessment of our foreign operational capital structure. Nevertheless, we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have an effect on our earnings.

59

Concentration and Credit Risk

We use concentration ratios to identify, understand and evaluate the potential impact of economic downturns and other adverse events that may affect our asset types, geographic locations, business models, and tenants, operators and managers. We evaluate concentration risk in terms of investment mix and operations mix. Investment mix measures the percentage of our investments that is concentrated in a specific asset type or that is operated or managed by a particular tenant, operator or manager. Operations mix measures the percentage of our operating results that is attributed to a particular tenant, operator or manager, geographic location or business model. The following tables reflect our concentration risk as of the dates and for the periods presented:

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure and reconciliations of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP, to NOI.

We derive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with escalators, subject to certain limitations. Some of our triple-net lease escalators are contingent upon the satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters or based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), with caps, floors or collars. We also earn revenues directly from individual residents in our senior housing communities that are managed by independent operators, such as Atria and Sunrise, and tenants in our office buildings.

The concentration of our triple-net leased properties segment revenues and operating income that are attributed to Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent and Kindred creates credit risk. If any of Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent or Kindred becomes unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations to us or to renew its leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof, our financial condition and results of operations could decline, and our ability to service our indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders could be impaired. See “Risk Factors—Our Business Operations and Strategy Risks—A significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of tenants and managers, including Brookdale Senior Living, Ardent, Kindred, Atria and Sunrise.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and “Note 3 – Concentration of Credit Risk” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

We regularly monitor and assess any changes in the relative credit risk of our significant tenants, and in particular those tenants that have recourse obligations under our triple-net leases. The ratios and metrics we use to evaluate a significant

61

tenant’s liquidity and creditworthiness depend on facts and circumstances specific to that tenant and the industry or industries in which it operates, including without limitation the tenant’s credit history and economic conditions related to the tenant, its operations and the markets in which the tenant operates, that may vary over time. Among other things, we may (i) review and analyze information regarding the real estate, senior housing and healthcare industries generally, publicly available information regarding the significant tenant, and information required to be provided by the tenant under the terms of its lease agreements with us, (ii) examine monthly or quarterly financial statements of the significant tenant to the extent publicly available or otherwise provided under the terms of our lease agreements, and (iii) participate in periodic discussions and in-person meetings with representatives of the significant tenant. Using this information, we calculate multiple financial ratios (which may, but do not necessarily, include leverage, fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth), after making certain adjustments based on our judgment, and assess other metrics we deem relevant to an understanding of the significant tenant’s credit risk.

Because Atria and Sunrise manage our properties in exchange for the receipt of a management fee from us, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of our managers in the same manner or to the same extent as our triple-net tenants. However, we rely on our managers’ personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our senior living operations efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Atria and Sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financials results in a timely manner and otherwise operate our senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, including various rights to terminate and exercise remedies under the agreements as provided therein, Atria’s or Sunrise’s failure, inability or unwillingness to satisfy its respective obligations under those agreements, to efficiently and effectively manage our properties or to provide timely and accurate accounting information with respect thereto could have a Material Adverse Effect on us. See “Risk Factors—Our Business Operations and Strategy Risks.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.

We hold a 34% ownership interest in Atria, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, including the right to appoint two members to the Atria Board of Directors.

Triple-Net Lease Performance and Expirations

Any failure, inability or unwillingness by our tenants to satisfy their obligations under our triple-net leases could have a material adverse effect on us. Also, if our tenants are not able or willing to renew our triple-net leases upon expiration, we may be unable to reposition the applicable properties on a timely basis or on the same or better economic terms, if at all. Although our lease expirations are staggered, the non-renewal of some or all of our triple-net leases that expire in any given year could have a material adverse effect on us. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had no triple-net lease renewals or expirations without renewal that, in the aggregate, had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations for that period. See “Risk Factors—Our Business Operations and Strategy Risks—If we must replace any of our tenants or managers, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” included in Part I, Item IA of this Annual Report.

Kindred may extend the term for 5 years by delivering a renewal notice to the Company 12 to 18 months prior to expiration. Brookdale may extend the term for 10 years by delivering a renewal notice to the Company 13 to 18 months prior to expiration. We cannot assure you that Kindred or Brookdale will exercise its renewal option for these properties. See “Risk Factors—Our Business Operations and Strategy Risk—If we need to replace any of our tenants or managers, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, if at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, and proceeds from asset sales.

For the next 12 months, our principal liquidity needs are to: (i) fund operating expenses; (ii) meet our debt service requirements; (iii) repay maturing mortgage and other debt; (iv) fund acquisitions, investments and commitments and any development and redevelopment activities; (v) fund capital expenditures; and (vi) make distributions to our stockholders and unitholders, as required for us to continue to qualify as a REIT. Depending upon the availability of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash. We expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program. However, an inability to access liquidity through multiple capital sources concurrently could have a material adverse effect on us.

Our material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, and operating obligations which include ground lease obligations. See “Note 10 – Senior Notes Payable and Other Debt” and “Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2022 relating to our long-term debt obligations and operating obligations, respectively.

Loans Receivable and Investments

In 2022, we provided secured debt financing in the aggregate amount of $29.1 million with terms ranging from two to five years and interest rates ranging from Term SOFR plus 3.75% to 5.00%.

63

As of December 31, 2022, we recognized a $20.0 million allowance on the Santerre Mezzanine Loan. The allowance for the Santerre Mezzanine Loan was calculated using the “current expected credit loss”, or “CECL”, model, which considers relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate expected losses as of the most recent balance sheet date. See “Note 2 – Accounting Policies - Fair Values of Financial Instruments” of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Santerre Mezzanine Loan has a current principal balance of $486.1 million, is priced at LIBOR + 6.42% and is freely prepayable in whole or in part subject to satisfaction of certain financial and non-financial terms and conditions. The Santerre Mezzanine Loan generated $40.0 million in loan interest income to Ventas in 2022. The Santerre Mezzanine Loan was entered into on June 7, 2019 for a five-year term, inclusive of three one-year extensions at the borrower’s option. The borrower has exercised two of its three extension options, with the final extension option exercisable between 30 to 60 days prior to the current maturity date of June 9, 2023, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions.

The Santerre Mezzanine Loan is subordinate to the rights of a $1.0 billion principal amount senior loan (the “Santerre Senior Loan”) priced at LIBOR + 1.84%. The Santerre Senior Loan is secured by a diverse pool of medical office, senior housing, skilled nursing and other healthcare assets and the Santerre Mezzanine Loan is secured by equity interests in entities that own those assets. Both loans are otherwise non-recourse to the borrower, subject to certain exceptions. The borrower has acquired an interest rate cap (the “Santerre Cap”) for the benefit of the Santerre Mezzanine Loan and the Santerre Senior Loan in the notional amount of $1.5 billion, which sets LIBOR at 3.36% and expires on June 9, 2023.

The borrower remained current on all financial obligations to Ventas through January 2023 and is expected to remain current through February 2023. However, the current post-Covid under-performance of certain of the collateral, coupled with the rise in interest rates in the third quarter and accelerating into the fourth quarter of 2022, has caused the ratio of net operating income of the collateral to interest due on the Santerre Mezzanine Loan to decline significantly.

While we believe that the borrower has taken and is taking targeted actions to attempt to improve the performance of or sell certain of the collateral, future cash flows from the collateral may be insufficient to fully pay interest expense on the Santerre Mezzanine Loan. If the borrower is unable to or does not meet its obligations under the Santerre Mezzanine Loan, there are a variety of remedies available to us, including the ability to foreclose on the collateral and assume and extend the Santerre Senior Loan for an additional year.

See also “Risk Factors – We face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our tenants, managers, borrowers and other obligors” and “Risk Factors – If a borrower defaults, we may be unable to obtain payment, successfully foreclose on collateral or realize the value of any collateral, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investment.”

Credit Facilities, Commercial Paper, Unsecured Term Loans and Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.7 billion of undrawn capacity on our unsecured revolving credit facility with $25.2 million borrowings outstanding and an additional $15.4 million restricted to support outstanding letters of credit. We limit our use of the unsecured revolving credit facility, to the extent necessary, to support our commercial paper program when commercial paper notes are outstanding.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Ventas Realty, Limited Partnership (“Ventas Realty”), may issue from time to time unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.0 billion. The notes are sold under customary terms in the U. S. commercial paper note market and are ranked pari passu with all of Ventas Realty’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Ventas, Inc. As of December 31, 2022, we had $403.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.

In June 2022, we entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) with Ventas Realty, as borrower. The New Credit Agreement replaces Ventas Realty’s previous $200.0 million unsecured term loan priced at LIBOR plus 0.90% that matured in 2023 with a new $500.0 million unsecured term loan that matures in 2027 and is initially priced at Term SOFR plus 0.95% based on Ventas Realty’s debt ratings. The New Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature that permits us to increase our aggregate borrowings thereunder to up to $1.25 billion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of additional commitments for such increase.

As of December 31, 2022, we had a C$500 million or $369.0 million unsecured term loan facility priced at Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”) plus 0.90% that matures in 2025.

64

In October 2022, we executed a letter agreement for a $100.0 million uncommitted line for standby letters of credit. The letter agreement contains certain customary covenants and under its terms, we are required to pay a commission on each outstanding letter of credit at a rate to be agreed upon in writing at issuance of each letter of credit. As of December 31, 2022, there were no material amounts outstanding under this facility.

Senior Notes

As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding $7.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by Ventas Realty, approximately $75.2 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by Nationwide Health Properties, Inc. (“NHP”) and assumed by our subsidiary, Nationwide Health Properties, LLC (“NHP LLC”), as successor to NHP, in connection with our acquisition of NHP, and C$1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by our subsidiary, Ventas Canada Finance Limited (“Ventas Canada”). All of the senior notes issued by Ventas Realty and Ventas Canada are unconditionally guaranteed by Ventas, Inc.

We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding senior notes for cash or in exchange for equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, prospects for capital and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

The indentures governing our outstanding senior notes require us to comply with various financial and other restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at December 31, 2022.

Mortgages

At December 31, 2022, our consolidated aggregate principal amount of mortgage debt outstanding was $2.4 billion, of which our share was $2.2 billion.

Under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries’ outstanding mortgage indebtedness, may restrict our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations, including our payment guarantees with respect to Ventas Realty’s and Ventas Canada Finance Limited’s senior notes.

Derivatives and Hedging

In the normal course of our business, interest rate fluctuations affect future cash flows under our variable rate debt obligations, loans receivable and marketable debt securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our operating results. We follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative instruments, to mitigate the impact of these risks.

Dividends

During 2022, we declared four dividends totaling $1.80 per share of our common stock, including a fourth quarter dividend of $0.45 per share. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gain). In addition, we will be subject to income tax at the regular corporate rate to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, including any net capital gains. We intend to pay dividends greater than 100% of our taxable income, after the use of any net operating loss carryforwards, for 2023.

We expect that our cash flows will exceed our REIT taxable income due to depreciation and other non-cash deductions in computing REIT taxable income and that we will be able to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. However, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to meet this requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or other liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, or if we desire to retain cash, we may borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements or any combination of the foregoing.

65

Capital Expenditures

The terms of our triple-net leases generally obligate our tenants to pay all capital expenditures necessary to maintain and improve our triple-net leased properties. However, from time to time, we may fund the capital expenditures for our triple-net leased properties through loans or advances to the tenants, which may increase the amount of rent payable with respect to the properties in certain cases. We may also fund capital expenditures for which we may become responsible upon expiration of our triple-net leases or in the event that our tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under those leases. We also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our SHOP and office operations reportable business segments with the cash flows from the properties or through additional borrowings. We expect that these liquidity needs generally will be satisfied by a combination of the following: cash flows from operations, cash on hand, debt assumptions and financings (including secured financings), issuances of debt and equity securities, dispositions of assets (in whole or in part through joint venture arrangements with third parties) and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program.

To the extent that unanticipated capital expenditure needs arise or significant borrowings are required, our liquidity may be affected adversely. Our ability to borrow additional funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of the instruments governing our outstanding indebtedness.

We are party to certain agreements that obligate us to develop senior housing or healthcare properties funded through capital that we and, in certain circumstances, our joint venture partners provide. As of December 31, 2022, we had 17 properties under development pursuant to these agreements, including five properties that are owned by an unconsolidated real estate entity. In addition, from time to time, we engage in redevelopment projects with respect to our existing senior housing communities to maximize the value, increase NOI, maintain a market-competitive position, achieve property stabilization or change the primary use of the property.

Equity Offerings

We participate in an “at-the-market” equity offering program (“ATM program”), pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to $1.0 billion aggregate gross sales price of shares of our common stock. There were no issuances under the ATM program for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we sold 10.9 million and 1.5 million shares of our common stock under our previous ATM program for gross proceeds of $626.4 million and $66.6 million, respectively, at an average gross price of $57.71 and $44.88 per share, respectively.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities increased $94.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 over the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased net operating income at our SHOP reportable business segment as a result of higher revenues, partially offset by higher property-level operating expenses; accretive acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of over 100 independent living communities from New Senior; partially offset by higher interest expense and lease resolutions with several smaller senior housing triple-net tenants who were materially affected by COVID-19.

66

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Cash flows from investing activities decreased $135.1 million during 2022 over 2021 primarily due to decreased proceeds from real estate dispositions and fewer proceeds received from the repayment of loans receivable in 2022, partially offset by lower acquisition volume in 2022.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Cash flows from financing activities increased $274.5 million during 2022 over 2021 primarily due to the 2021 redemptions of $1.1 billion of senior notes due in 2022 and 2023, partially offset by the 2021 issuance of 10.9 million shares of common stock through our ATM equity offering program and increased borrowings under our commercial paper program in 2021.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We own interests in certain unconsolidated entities as described in “Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Entities.” Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding loans receivable. In addition, we have certain properties which serve as collateral for debt that is owed by a previous owner of certain of our facilities, as described under “Note 10 – Senior Notes Payable and Other Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our risk of loss for these certain properties is limited to the outstanding debt balance plus penalties, if any. Further, we use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Finally, at December 31, 2022, we had $15.4 million outstanding letters of credit obligations. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources except those described above.

Guarantor and Issuer Financial Information

Ventas, Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the outstanding senior notes issued by our 100% owned subsidiary, Ventas Realty. None of our other subsidiaries is obligated with respect to Ventas Realty’s outstanding senior notes.

Ventas, Inc. has also fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the outstanding senior notes issued by our 100% owned subsidiary, Ventas Canada Finance Limited (“Ventas Canada”). None of our other subsidiaries is obligated with respect to Ventas Canada’s outstanding senior notes, all of which were issued on a private placement basis in Canada.

In connection with the acquisition of Nationwide Health Properties, Inc. (“NHP”), our 100% owned subsidiary Nationwide Health Properties, LLC (“NHP LLC”), as successor to NHP, assumed the obligation to pay principal and interest with respect to the outstanding senior notes issued by NHP. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries (other than NHP LLC) is obligated with respect to any of NHP LLC’s outstanding senior notes.

In addition, Ventas, Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the obligations under our $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, our C$500 million unsecured term loan facility, the New Credit Agreement and our $100.0 million uncommitted line for standby letters of credit.

Under certain circumstances, contractual and legal restrictions, including those contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries’ outstanding mortgage indebtedness, may restrict our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations, including our payment guarantees with respect to Ventas Realty’s and Ventas Canada’s senior notes.
