PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

Loss on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt primarily consists of a premium payment and the write-off of debt issuance costs in connection with the May 2022 tender offers of our 3.20% February 2018 Senior Notes and 4.25% May 2013 Senior Notes and make-whole payments in connection with the early redemption of our (i) 3.20% February 2018 Senior Notes and 4.25% May 2013 Senior Notes (Fiscal 2023) and (ii) 2.70% May 2017 Senior Notes and 2.65% November 2017 Senior Notes (Fiscal 2022). For additional information, refer to Note 12.

(Provision for) benefit from income taxes
The provision for income taxes increased to $422.1 million for Fiscal 2023 from $309.4 million for Fiscal 2022. Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2023 was 110.0% as compared with 99.7% for Fiscal 2022. In comparison to prior year, our taxes were impacted primarily by:

•an increase in the valuation allowance related to our investment in Canopy; and
•a higher income tax benefit from stock-based compensation award activity for Fiscal 2022 from changes in option exercise activity; partially offset by
•a net income tax benefit recognized from the realization of tax losses related to a prior period divestiture; and
•the effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses, including the impact of the Fiscal 2022 long-lived asset impairment of brewery construction in progress.

For additional information, refer to Note 13.

We expect our reported effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 18% to 20%. This range does not reflect any future changes in the fair value of our Canopy investment measured at fair value and any future equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy Equity Method Investment and related activities. On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law in the U.S. We do not currently expect the IRA to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual effective tax rate and/or overall liquidity.

Net income (loss) attributable to CBI
Net loss attributable to CBI increased to $71.0 million for Fiscal 2023 from $40.4 million for Fiscal 2022. This increase of $30.6 million, or 76%, is largely attributable to (i) the impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment, (ii) the increase in equity losses from Canopy’s results, and (iii) the increase in the provision for income taxes, partially offset by (i) the decrease in unrealized net loss from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy, (ii) the impairment of long-lived assets for Fiscal 2022 in connection with certain assets at the Mexicali Brewery, and (iii) the improvements within the Beer segment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. Our ability to consistently generate robust cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths; it enables us to invest in our people and our brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock. Our largest use of cash in our operations is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. Historically, we have used this cash flow to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. Additionally, our commercial paper program is used to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. We use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures, among other things.

We seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share

repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.

The Reclassification required significant cash outlays during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. Pursuant to the Reclassification, each share of Class B Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was reclassified, exchanged, and converted into one share of Class A Stock and received $64.64 in cash, without interest. The aggregate cash payment to holders of Class B Stock at the Effective Time was $1.5 billion. We utilized our $1.0 billion three-year term loan facility under the August 2022 Term Credit Agreement and borrowings under our commercial paper program to fund the aggregate cash payment to holders of Class B Stock. In addition, we incurred $37.8 million of non-recurring costs and expenses for Fiscal 2023 in connection with the completion of the Reclassification. In February 2023, we repaid a portion of our indebtedness under the August 2022 Term Credit Agreement with proceeds from the February 2023 Senior Notes. We do not expect the Reclassification to have an ongoing material impact on our liquidity. For additional information, refer to Note 17.

We have an agreement with a financial institution for payment services and began to facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program through this participating financial institution during Fiscal 2023. The program is available to certain of our suppliers allowing them the option to manage their cash flow. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institution and the suppliers in connection with the program. Our rights and obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. For additional information, refer to Note 16.

The net change in operating assets and liabilities was largely driven by (i) a net income tax benefit recognized from the realization of tax losses related to a prior period divestiture, (ii) accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments for the Beer segment, and (iii) an exclusivity payment received in connection with distribution arrangements for our U.S. wine and spirits brand portfolio in Fiscal 2022. These changes were partially offset by the timing of collections for (i) recoverable value-added taxes for the Beer segment and (ii) accounts receivable for the Wine and Spirits segment. Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities benefited from lower income tax payments in Fiscal 2023 as compared to Fiscal 2022.

Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2023 decreased to $999.4 million for Fiscal 2023 from $1,035.8 million for Fiscal 2022. This decrease of $36.4 million, or 4%, was primarily due to (i) $92.1 million of higher proceeds from sale of business, driven by the 2022 Wine Divestiture, and (ii) $16.4 million of lower business acquisitions, partially offset by $74.4 million from the sale of an investment made through our corporate venture capital function in Fiscal 2022.

Debt

Total debt outstanding as of February 28, 2023, amounted to $12,461.3 million, an increase of $2,044.8 million from February 28, 2022. This increase consisted of:

Bank facilities
In April 2022, the Company and the Administrative Agent and Lender amended the June 2021 Term Credit Agreement. The principal changes effected by the April 2022 amendment were the refinement of certain negative covenants and replacement of LIBOR rates with rates based on term SOFR.

In April 2022, we entered into the 2022 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the 2020 Credit Agreement. The 2022 Restatement Agreement resulted in (i) the refinance and increase of the existing revolving credit facility from $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion and extension of its maturity to April 14, 2027, (ii) the refinement of certain negative covenants, and (iii) the replacement of LIBOR rates with rates based on term SOFR. There are no borrowings outstanding under the 2022 Credit Agreement.

In August 2022, we entered into the August 2022 Term Credit Agreement. The August 2022 Term Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion three-year term loan facility and is not subject to amortization payments, with the balance due and payable on November 10, 2025. In February 2023, we repaid a portion of our indebtedness under the August 2022 Term Credit Agreement with proceeds from the February 2023 Senior Notes.

In October 2022, we entered into the October 2022 Credit Agreement Amendments which revised certain defined terms and covenants in our credit agreements. These amendments will become effective upon (i) the amendment by Canopy of its Articles of Incorporation, (ii) the conversion of our Canopy common shares into Exchangeable Shares, and (iii) the resignation of our nominees from the board of directors of Canopy.

Senior notes
In May 2022, we issued the May 2022 Senior Notes. Proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $1,837.1 million were used towards a series of cash tender offers to purchase a portion of the 3.20% February 2018 Senior Notes and the 4.25% May 2013 Senior Notes, the June 2022 redemption of the remaining outstanding balance of the 3.20% February 2018 Senior Notes and the 4.25% May 2013 Senior Notes

and a make-whole premium, and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, funding capital expenditures, retirement of debt, and other business opportunities.

In February 2023, we issued the February 2023 Senior Notes. Proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance, of $497.1 million were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of a portion of our indebtedness under our August 2022 Term Credit Agreement.

General
The majority of our outstanding borrowings as of February 28, 2023, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2024 to calendar 2050, and variable-rate senior unsecured term loan facilities under our April 2022 Term Credit Agreement and August 2022 Term Credit Agreement with calendar 2024 and 2025 maturity dates, respectively, as follows:

Additionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.25 billion of commercial paper, inclusive of a $250.0 million increase implemented in December 2022. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility.

We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. If the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2022 Credit Agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. We do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility.

We had the following remaining borrowing capacity available under our 2022 Credit Agreement:

The financial institutions participating in our 2022 Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe they will comply with any future funding requests. However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.

As of February 28, 2023, we and our subsidiaries were subject to covenants that are contained in our 2022 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional subsidiary indebtedness, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio, both as defined in our 2022 Credit Agreement. As of February 28, 2023, under our 2022 Credit Agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 4.0x.

The representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default set forth in our April 2022 Term Credit Agreement and our August 2022 Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in our 2022 Credit Agreement.

Our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to: (i) a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii) a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii) restrictions on mergers, consolidations, and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.

As of February 28, 2023, we were in compliance with our covenants under our 2022 Credit Agreement, our April 2022 Term Credit Agreement, our August 2022 Term Credit Agreement, and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.

For further discussion and presentation of our borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to Note 12.

Common Stock Dividends

On April 5, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.89 per share of Class A Stock and $0.80 per share of Class 1 Stock payable on May 18, 2023, to stockholders of record of each class as of the close of business on May 4, 2023. We expect to return approximately $650 million to stockholders in Fiscal 2024 through cash dividends.

We currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our Board of Directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.

Share Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of our publicly traded common stock of up to $3.0 billion under the 2018 Authorization and an additional repurchase of up to $2.0 billion under the 2021 Authorization. The 2018 Authorization was fully utilized as of May 31, 2022.

During Fiscal 2023, we repurchased 7,086,446 shares of Class A Stock pursuant to the 2018 Authorization and 2021 Authorization at an aggregate cost of $1,700.2 million, excluding the impact of Federal excise tax owed pursuant to the IRA, or an average cost of $239.92 per share, through a combination of open market transactions and an ASR. We primarily used cash on hand to pay the purchase price for the repurchased shares.

2021 Authorization $ 2,000.0 $ 1,136.6 4,831,910

Share repurchases under the 2021 Authorization may be accomplished at management’s discretion from time to time based on market conditions, our cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management. Shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. We may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations and/or proceeds from borrowings. Any repurchased shares will become treasury shares, including shares repurchased under the 2018 Authorization and the 2021 Authorization.

We currently expect to continue to repurchase shares in the future, but such repurchases are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.

For additional information, refer to Note 17.

Capital Resources

We have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating and financing activities will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.

The following sets forth information about our outstanding obligations at February 28, 2023. For a detailed discussion of the items noted in the following table, refer to Notes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.

We have invested $75.8 million and $9.6 million through Fiscal 2023 in female-founded or led companies and minority-owned companies, respectively.

Capital Expenditures

During Fiscal 2023, we incurred $1,035.4 million for capital expenditures, including $813.9 million for the Beer segment primarily for the Mexico Beer Projects. We plan to spend from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for capital expenditures in Fiscal 2024, including approximately $1 billion for the Beer segment associated primarily with the Mexico Beer Projects. The remaining planned Fiscal 2024 capital expenditures consist of improvements to existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current and projected future business needs.

In April 2022, we announced that, with the assistance of the Mexican government and state and local officials in Mexico, we acquired land in Veracruz for the construction of the Veracruz Brewery where there is ample water and we will have a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs. The design and construction process for the Veracruz Brewery is underway. See Note 7 for further discussion.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1. Certain policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management to determine appropriate assumptions to be used in certain estimates; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We review estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business on an ongoing basis. Our critical accounting estimates include:

•Equity method investments. We monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary impairment. We consider several factors when evaluating our investments, including, but not limited to, (i) the period of time for which the fair value has been less than the carrying value, (ii) operating and financial performance of the investee, (iii) the investee’s future business plans and projections, (iv) recent transactions and market valuations of publicly traded companies, where available, (v) discussions with their management, and (vi) our ability and intent to hold the investment until it recovers in value.

PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

Canopy Equity Method Investment – monitored for other-than-temporary impairment at each reporting date, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable.

As of February 28, 2022, the carrying value of our Canopy Equity Method Investment exceeded the fair value by $1,488.7 million. As of August 31, 2022, we evaluated the Canopy Equity Method Investment and determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment based on several contributing factors, including: (i) the period of time for which the fair value had been less than the carrying value and the uncertainty surrounding Canopy’s stock price recovering in the near-term, (ii) Canopy recording a significant impairment of goodwill related to its cannabis operations during its three months ended June 30, 2022, and (iii) the uncertainty of U.S. federal cannabis permissibility. As a result, the Canopy Equity Method Investment with a carrying value of $1,695.1 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $634.8 million, resulting in an impairment of $1,060.3 million. The estimated fair value was determined based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of August 31, 2022.

As of February 28, 2023, the carrying value of our Canopy Equity Method Investment exceeded the fair value by $87.4 million. If Canopy’s stock price does not recover above our C$3.84 carrying value in the near-term, there may be an additional impairment of our Canopy Equity Method Investment.

•Fair value of financial instruments. Management’s estimate of fair value requires significant judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions and the availability of specific information. The fair values of our financial instruments that require the application of significant judgment by management are as follows:

Canopy investment
Equity securities, Warrants – estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement) and Monte Carlo simulations (Level 2 fair value measurement). These valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. Management applies significant judgment in its determination of expected volatility. We consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and apply limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.

Debt securities – estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on market spreads using bond data as of the valuation date. This valuation model uses various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable.

•Goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets are classified into three categories: (i) goodwill, (ii) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, and (iii) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization. For intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. We may perform a qualitative evaluation prior to a quantitative test to determine if an impairment exists. However, if the results of the qualitative evaluation are inconclusive or suggest an impairment may exist, we must proceed to the quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors, including market conditions, industry changes, actual results as compared to forecasted results, or the timing of recent acquisitions and/or divestitures. The quantitative test estimates the fair value utilizing assumptions and projections regarding items such as future cash flows, revenues, earnings, and other factors. The factors and assumptions used reflect management’s estimates and are based on historical trends, projections, and assumptions, including expectations of future economic and competitive conditions that are used in current strategic operating plans; however, these are subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. If these estimates or

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------
Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2023 Form 10-K #WORTHREACHINGFOR I 53

------- ------------ -----------------
PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of January 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.

Goodwill – Our reporting units with goodwill include the Beer segment and the Wine and Spirits segment. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the quantitative assessment. No indication of impairment was noted for either of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. Based on this analysis, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the Wine and Spirits reporting unit with approximately 26% excess fair value. For Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.

The most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with the impairment testing are: (i) the discount rate, (ii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iii) the annual cash flow projections. As of January 1, 2023, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher, used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower, or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit’s net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value. Therefore, we did not have any indication of potential impairment.

Other intangible assets – Our intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Using the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method.

In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, certain continued negative trends within our Funky Buddha and Four Corners craft beer portfolios, including ongoing negative cash flows, resulted in management’s decision to revise our long-term financial forecasts for these portfolios. Accordingly, the Beer segment’s Funky Buddha and Four Corners craft beer businesses recognized $9.0 million and $4.0 million impairment losses, respectively, in connection with the write-off of their trademark assets. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion. Additionally, in connection with our annual trademark analysis, we performed a quantitative assessment for the import beer, wine, and spirits trademarks and concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of these trademark units.

For Fiscal 2022, as a result of our annual trademark impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of our trademark units. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021, certain negative trends within our Four Corners craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts indicating lower revenue and cash flow generation for the related portfolio. This change in financial forecasts indicated it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Four Corners trademark might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Beer segment’s Four Corners craft beer business recognized a $6.0 million impairment loss in connection with its trademark asset. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion.

The most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the

PART II ITEM 7. MD&A Table of Contents

estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are: (i) the estimated royalty rate, (ii) the discount rate, (iii) the expected long-term growth rate, and (iv) the annual revenue projections. As of January 1, 2023, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower, used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher, used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower, or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting’s carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.

Divestitures – When some, but not all of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is disposed of, some of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of. The allocation of goodwill is based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining. This approach requires a determination of the fair value of both the business being disposed and the businesses retained within the reporting unit.

For Fiscal 2023, our estimate of fair value for the 2022 Wine Divestiture was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transaction. The components sold were a part of the Wine and Spirits segment and were included in that reporting unit through the date of divestiture. Goodwill was allocated to the assets based on the relative fair value of the business being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets associated with the divestiture remained in the wine and spirits reporting unit.

For Fiscal 2021, our estimate of fair value for the Paul Masson Divestiture, the Wine and Spirits Divestitures, the Concentrate Business Divestiture, and the Ballast Point Divestiture was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transactions. The components sold were a part of the Wine and Spirits or Beer segment and were included in those reporting units through the date of divestiture. Goodwill was allocated to the assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the businesses being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets associated with the respective divestitures remained in the wine and spirits or beer reporting unit.

•Accounting for income taxes. We estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes, and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws, and tax planning strategies. We are subject to income taxes in Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions. We are regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved.

We believe all tax positions are fully supported. We recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the FASB guidance for income tax accounting. Accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. If necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not they will not be realized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent

and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. We believe it is more likely than not the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. Changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.

Change in Accounting Guidance

Accounting guidance adopted for Fiscal 2023 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 2, 2022, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services: ------------- -------------------- ----- (in millions) Fiscal Year Purchase Obligations 2023 $ 1,632 2024 921 2025 775 2026 753 2027 783 Thereafter 1,226 Total $ 6,090 Royalties We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...
