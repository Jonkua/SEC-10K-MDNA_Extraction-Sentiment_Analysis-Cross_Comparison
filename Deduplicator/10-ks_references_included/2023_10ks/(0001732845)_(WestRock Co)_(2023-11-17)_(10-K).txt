Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

We are a multinational provider of sustainable fiber-based paper and packaging solutions. We partner with our customers to provide differentiated, sustainable paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our team members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

Presentation

We report our financial results of operations in four reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, Consumer Packaging, Global Paper and Distribution. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) is our measure of segment profitability in accordance with ASC 280, because it is the measure used by our chief operating decision maker (“CODM") to make decisions regarding allocation of resources and to assess segment performance.

Certain items are not allocated to our operating segments and, thus, the information that our CODM uses to make operating decisions and assess performance does not reflect such amounts. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as pre-tax earnings of a reportable segment before depreciation, depletion and amortization, and excludes the following items our CODM does not consider part of our segment performance: multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense, restructuring and other costs, net, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, non-allocated expenses, interest expense, net, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, other (expense) income, net, Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga (as hereinafter defined) and other adjustments ("Adjusted EBITDA") — each as outlined in “Note 8. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

A detailed discussion of the fiscal 2023 year-over-year changes can be found below and a detailed discussion of fiscal 2022 year-over-year changes can be found in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes as well as the risk factors included in Item 1A.

Strategic Portfolio Actions

We are committed to improving our return on invested capital as well as maximizing the performance of our assets. From time to time, we have completed acquisitions that have expanded our product and geographic scope, allowed us to increase our integration levels and impacted our comparative financials. Subject to restrictions in the Transaction Agreement, we expect to continue to evaluate potential transactions in the future, although their size may vary.

On December 1, 2022, we completed the Mexico Acquisition for $969.8 million in cash and the assumption of debt. We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination resulting in its consolidation. The acquiree is a leading integrated producer of fiber-based sustainable packaging solutions that operates four paper mills, nine corrugated packaging plants and six high graphic plants throughout Mexico, producing sustainable packaging for a wide range of end markets in the region. This acquisition is expected to provide us with further geographic and end market diversification as well as position us to continue to grow in the Latin American market. We have included the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging segment. In conjunction with our Mexico Acquisition, we also moved certain existing consumer converting operations in Latin America into our Corrugated Packaging segment in line with how we are managing the business effective January 1, 2023. We did not recast prior year results related to these operations as they were not material. However, we have disclosed those impacts in the respective results of operations section below. See “Note 3. Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In addition, in fiscal 2023, we divested our interior partitions converting operations and sold our Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill (the resulting gain referred to as the "Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga"), sold our ownership interest in an unconsolidated displays joint venture, sold our Seven Hills mill joint venture in Lynchburg, VA, and sold our Eaton, IN, and Aurora, IL uncoated recycled paperboard mills. These divestitures align with our commitment to optimize our portfolio and focus our strategy on key end markets. See

Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Description of Business” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In fiscal 2023, we announced our plan to permanently cease operating our Tacoma, WA and North Charleston, SC containerboard mills and recorded various impairment and other charges associated with the closures. These mills ceased production in September 2023 and June 2023, respectively. In fiscal 2022, we recorded charges associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Panama City, FL mill and to permanently close the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our St. Paul, MN mill. These mills ceased production in June 2022 and October 2022, respectively. By closing these mills, significant capital that would have been required to keep the mills competitive in the future is expected to be deployed to improve key assets. See “Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Transaction Agreement with Smurfit Kappa

On September 12, 2023, we entered into Transaction Agreement with Smurfit Kappa. As a result of the proposed Transaction, each share of Common Stock, with certain exceptions, will be converted into the right to receive one ListCo Share and $5.00 in cash. The Transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2024, conditional upon regulatory approvals, shareholder approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions. See Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Description of Business” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Business Systems Transformation

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we launched a multi-year phased business systems transformation project that is expected to cost approximately $0.5 to $0.6 billion. The investment will replace much of our existing disparate systems and transition them to a standardized ERP system on a cloud-based platform, as well as a suite of other complementing technologies, across over an estimated 80% of our footprint based on net sales. Approximately 90% of the project spend is expected to be related to the implementation of the ERP, including process definition, standardization and simplification, with the remaining costs primarily related to the implementation of complementing technologies.

 The new systems are intended to transform areas such as manufacturing, supply chain, procurement, quote to cash, financials and analytics, and position us to better leverage automation and process efficiency and enable productivity enhancements. An implementation of this scale is a major financial undertaking and will require substantial time and attention of management and key employees. Project completion dates and anticipated costs may also change. As the systems are phased in, they will become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting.

Due to the nature, scope and magnitude of this investment, management believes these incremental transformation costs are above the normal, recurring level of spend for information technology to support operations. These strategic investments are not expected to recur in the foreseeable future, and are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance. As such, management believes presenting these costs as an adjustment in the non-GAAP results provides additional information to investors about trends in our operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons. This presentation also allows investors to view our underlying operating results in the same manner as they are viewed by management.

The expenses expected to be adjusted from Net income attributable to common stockholders ("Net Income") are expensed as incurred during the implementation of software applications and other enabling technologies, and do not include deferred or capitalized costs, depreciation and/or amortization, and costs to support or maintain these software applications or systems once they are in productive use. During the investment period, the normal level of spend associated with non-transformative programs is expected to be maintained and these expenses will not be adjusted in our non-GAAP measures. The items adjusted from Net Income will also be adjusted in our presentation of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.

We expect approximately half of the estimated $0.5 to $0.6 billion investment will represent incremental operating costs to be adjusted in our Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share non-GAAP measures over the course of the project, with substantially all such costs being recorded within selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense in the consolidated statements of operations. These non-GAAP

34

adjustments would not include any cash operating costs that are expected to continue to recur after the business systems transformation project is completed.

 In fiscal 2023, we invested $138 million in our business systems transformation; $91 million of this amount was expensed as incurred within SG&A, including amortization, and $47 million was deferred or capitalized. Of the amount expensed, $79 million, or 87%, were adjusted from Net Income for our non-GAAP measures. The deferred and capitalized costs are being amortized as the project is deployed.

 In fiscal 2024, we expect the aggregate investment in our business systems transformation to be approximately $220 million. We expect approximately $90 million to be expensed when incurred, of which approximately 80% would be adjusted from Net Income for our non-GAAP financial measures. Approximately $130 million is expected to be deferred or capitalized and amortized over future periods as the project is deployed.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Net sales of $20.3 billion for fiscal 2023 decreased $946.5 million, or 4.5%, compared to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2022. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency which were partially offset by increased sales due to the Mexico Acquisition and higher selling price/mix.

Net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2023 was not comparable to the Net income attributable to common stockholders of $944.6 million in fiscal 2022 primarily due to the $1.9 billion pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. See "Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Goodwill” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, the decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes excluding the Mexico Acquisition, the impact of increased economic downtime and prior year mill closures, higher restructuring costs, estimated increased cost inflation, increased non-cash pension costs, higher net interest expense, business systems transformation costs and the loss recorded in connection with the Mexico Acquisition. These items were partially offset by the impact of higher selling price/mix, cost savings, the Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga, the contribution from the Mexico Acquisition, and the gain on sale of unconsolidated entities. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion in fiscal 2023 decreased $480.8 million, or 13.9%, compared to fiscal 2022. A detailed review of our performance appears below under “Results of Operations”.

Earnings per diluted share was a loss of $6.44 in fiscal 2023 compared to income of $3.61 in fiscal 2022. Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share were $3.02 and $4.76 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. See the discussion and tables under "Definitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below with respect to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share.

We generated $1.8 billion of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023, compared to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022. The $192.5 million decline was primarily due to lower earnings, partially offset by $668.0 million of reduced working capital usage compared to the prior year period. We invested $1,142.1 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 while returning $281.3 million in dividends to our stockholders. We believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest to sustain and improve our operating performance. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information.

A detailed review of our performance appears below under “Results of Operations”.

Expectations for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2024

In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect a decline in net sales and earnings from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, reflecting the normal seasonal sequential volume declines in many of our businesses, continued realization of published price declines and scheduled mill maintenance outages. We plan to continue balancing our supply with our customers’ demand. We expect sequentially higher recycled fiber costs, lower chemical costs and relatively flat energy, virgin fiber and freight costs. We also expect increased health insurance costs prior to the annual reset of employee deductibles.

35

In fiscal 2024, we expect financial results to be favorably weighted to the back half of the year due to seasonality and the expected improvement in demand trends. We expect continued realization of published price declines, continued balancing of our supply with our customers’ demand, higher costs driven by higher recycled fiber, freight and wages and other costs, and lower energy, virgin fiber and chemical costs. We also expect our results to be negatively impacted by scheduled mill maintenance outages. We expect approximately 550,000 tons of maintenance downtime compared to approximately 507,000 tons in fiscal 2023. We expect to further progress on cost savings initiatives and are targeting $300 to $400 million in cost savings in fiscal 2024. We expect to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other costs in connection with the proposed Transaction. As noted above, in fiscal 2024, we also expect the aggregate investment in our business systems transformation to be approximately $220 million, approximately $90 million of which we expect to expense as incurred. We expect fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect our fiscal 2024 cash tax rate will be higher than our expected income tax rate. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Cash Flow Activity” for additional information.

RANSOMWARE INCIDENT

As previously disclosed, on January 23, 2021, we detected a ransomware incident impacting certain of our systems. Promptly upon our detection of this incident, we initiated response and containment protocols and our security teams, supplemented by leading cyber defense firms, worked to remediate this incident. These actions included taking preventative measures, such as shutting down certain systems out of an abundance of caution, as well as taking steps to supplement existing security monitoring, scanning and protective measures. In our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we announced that all systems were back in service.

In fiscal 2022 and 2023, we realized incremental progress against our resiliency objectives. We improved our mean-time-to-resolve security incidents, optimized our endpoint detection and response technology deployments across all of our workstation and server population, transitioned all of our local drives to cloud-based storage, and progressed against key goals to modernize the security and infrastructure of our operating locations. In fiscal 2024, we expect to further advance the maturity of our resiliency posture by continuing to execute against our multi-year roadmap. Quarterly progress, as well as key risks and issues, are reported to the Audit Committee for oversight and monitoring.

In fiscal 2023, we received $10 million of business interruption insurance recoveries related to the ransomware incident, which we recorded as a reduction of Cost of goods sold and presented in net cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our recoveries related to the ransomware incident are now complete. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $57.2 million credit for ransomware insurance recoveries, recording $50.6 million of business interruption recoveries as a reduction of Cost of goods sold and $6.6 million of direct cost recoveries as a reduction of SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization. We present ransomware recoveries received as Net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

For more information on the ransomware incident, see “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Ransomware Incident” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (4.8 ) (4.6 )
Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ (1,649.0 ) $ 944.6

Net Sales (Unaffiliated Customers)

Net sales in fiscal 2023 of $20.3 billion decreased $946.5 million, or 4.5%, compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, which were largely offset by increased sales due to the Mexico Acquisition and higher selling price/mix.

See “Segment Information” below for detailed information regarding the change in net sales before intersegment eliminations by segment.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold decreased to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $17.2 billion in fiscal 2022. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 82.4% in fiscal 2023 compared to 81.1% in fiscal 2022. The dollar decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to lower volumes and the impact of cost savings which were partially offset by the impact of estimated increased net cost inflation. Net cost inflation consisted primarily of higher wage and benefit costs, chemical costs, freight costs and virgin fiber costs which were partially offset by lower recycled fiber costs and energy costs including hedges.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense Excluding Intangible Amortization

SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization increased $81.8 million to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2022. SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal 2023 to 9.9% from 9.1% in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to $93.2 million related to the Mexico Acquisition and $90.5 million of business systems transformation costs. Travel and entertainment expense also increased by $19.4 million. Excluding these items, compensation and benefit costs were $117.3 million lower, reflecting cost savings and achievement of lower performance goals compared to the prior year period.

37

Selling, General and Administrative Intangible Amortization Expense

SG&A intangible amortization expense was $341.5 million and $350.4 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The expense primarily represents the amortization of customer relationship intangibles acquired in business combinations.

Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense

In fiscal 2023 we recorded multiemployer pension withdrawal income of $12.1 million related to non-PIUMPF arbitrations. In fiscal 2022, we recorded multiemployer pension withdrawal expense of $0.2 million. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans — MEPPs” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Restructuring and Other Costs, Net

We recorded pre-tax restructuring and other costs, net of $859.2 million and $383.0 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of these costs, $604.6 million and $334.1 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, were non-cash. The charges in fiscal 2023 were primarily associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Tacoma, WA and North Charleston, SC containerboard mills, and the charges in fiscal 2022 were primarily associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Panama City, FL mill and the permanent closure of the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our St. Paul, MN mill. In addition, in both years we incurred charges for other facility closure activities, reduction in workforce actions and charges associated with acquisition, integration or divestiture activities.

These amounts are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with a given restructuring, acquisition, integration or divestiture vary. We generally expect the integration of a closed facility’s assets and production with other facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility. While restructuring costs are not charged to our segments and, therefore, do not reduce each segment's Adjusted EBITDA, we highlight the segment to which the charges relate. See “Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a description of the type of costs incurred. We have restructured portions of our operations from time to time, have current restructuring initiatives taking place, and it is likely that we will engage in future restructuring activities.

Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights

In fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment of $1.9 billion, with $1.4 billion and $0.5 billion in the Global Paper and Corrugated Packaging reportable segments, respectively. The impairment is not included in Adjusted EBITDA of our segments. See “Note 8. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $26.0 million pre-tax non-cash impairment of certain mineral rights driven by a lack of new leasing or development activity on the related properties for an extended period of time. With the impairment, we had no value assigned to our remaining mineral rights.

Interest Expense, net

Interest expense, net was $417.9 million and $318.8 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest expense increased $159.5 million and was partially offset by increased interest income of $60.4 million. The net increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates on debt in the current year period and increased debt associated with the Mexico Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by higher interest income on our cash in fiscal 2023. Additionally, fiscal 2022 included a $36.2 million reduction in interest expense associated with the remeasurement of our multiemployer pension liabilities for the change in interest rates.

Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt

In fiscal 2023, gain on extinguishment of debt was $10.5 million and in fiscal 2022, loss on extinguishment of debt was $8.5 million. In fiscal 2023, we discharged $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% senior notes due September 2024 using cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our commercial paper program.

38

 The loss in fiscal 2022 was primarily related to the redemption of $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior notes due March 2023 primarily using borrowings under our Receivables Securitization Facility (as hereinafter defined).

Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income

Pension and other postretirement non-service cost in fiscal 2023 was $21.8 million compared to income of $157.4 million in fiscal 2022. The higher costs in fiscal 2023 were primarily due to lower plan assets at September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase in the expected return on plan assets at September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year. These costs were also increased due to higher interest rates during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Customary pension and other postretirement cost (income) are included in our segment results. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Other (Expense) Income, net

Other (expense) income, net was expense of $6.1 million and expense of $11.0 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The lower net expense in fiscal 2023 primarily included a favorable $13.7 million impact of foreign currency, a favorable $12.0 million of other non-operating costs and a favorable $7.3 million on the sale of businesses, each as compared to fiscal 2022. These items were partially offset by $27.9 million of increased expense in connection with the sale of receivables. The favorable other non-operating costs included a $19.7 million gain on foreign currency exchange contract derivatives entered into in anticipation of the Mexico Acquisition, and the favorable sale of businesses included an $11.2 million gain on the sale of our Eaton, IN and Aurora, IL uncoated recycled paperboard mills.

Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities

Equity in income of unconsolidated entities in fiscal 2023 was income of $3.4 million compared to income of $72.9 million in fiscal 2022. The decline in income in fiscal 2023 was driven by a $46.8 million non-cash, pre-tax loss to recognize the write-off of historical foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as well as the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid for the Mexico Acquisition and the carrying value of our prior ownership interest. That loss was partially offset by the $19.3 million pre-tax gain on sale of our displays joint venture and a $7.6 million pre-tax gain on sale of our Seven Hills mill joint venture. Additionally, the change year-over-year was impacted by no longer recording equity income after the purchase of our remaining interest in the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition and stronger performance by the displays joint venture in the prior year period. See “Note 3. Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga

In fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our interior partitions converting operations and the sale of our Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill to our joint venture partner and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $238.8 million, excluding divestiture costs. Divestiture costs are expensed as incurred and recorded within Restructuring and other costs, net. See “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Description of Business” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Provision for Income Taxes

We recorded an income tax benefit of $60.4 million for fiscal 2023 at an effective tax rate benefit of 3.5%, compared to income tax expense of $269.6 million at an effective tax rate of 22.1% in fiscal 2022. The low tax rate in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the tax effects related to the goodwill impairment. See “Note 7. Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a table reconciling the statutory federal tax rate to our effective tax rate.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Corrugated Packaging Segment

Corrugated Packaging Shipments

Corrugated Packaging shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent in thousands of tons, which includes external and intersegment shipments from our corrugated converting operations, principally for the sale of corrugated containers and other corrugated products. Tons sold from period to period may be impacted by customer conversions to lower basis weight products. In addition, we disclose North American Corrugated Packaging shipments in billion square feet (“BSF”) and millions of square feet ("MMSF”) per shipping day. In the industry, the term “North American Corrugated Packaging” commonly refers to U.S. and Canadian operations only. We have presented this shipment data in this manner because we believe investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others find this breakout useful when evaluating our operating performance.

Net Sales before intersegment eliminations, also referred to as segment sales.

Net Sales (Aggregate) — Corrugated Packaging Segment

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Corrugated Packaging segment increased $747.3 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. The increase primarily consisted of $1.1 billion of sales from the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition, $281.7 million of higher selling price/mix and $111.6 million associated with the converting operations formerly in the Consumer Packaging segment, which were partially offset by $762.4 million of lower volumes excluding the Mexico Acquisition. Volumes were impacted by lower demand for certain of our products, as well as certain inventory rebalancing throughout the supply chain.

Adjusted EBITDA — Corrugated Packaging Segment

Corrugated Packaging segment Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 increased $213.7 million compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to an estimated $281.9 million margin impact from higher selling price/mix and $162.1 million of cost savings. These items were partially offset by an estimated $220.6 million impact of economic downtime and prior year mill closures, and $145.2 million of lower volumes. Additionally, we had $131.7 million of other net favorable items that consisted primarily of $161.0 million from the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition and $14.9 million associated with converting operations formerly in the Consumer Packaging segment that were partially offset by $33.3 million of higher non-cash pension costs and $28.3 million of lower equity in income of unconsolidated entities excluding our former joint venture in Mexico and $22.4 million of lower net ransomware recoveries in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022. Estimated net cost deflation ended the year essentially flat at $3.8 million as cost deflation in the last half of the year more than offset cost inflation in the first half of the fiscal year, each as compared to fiscal 2022.

Net Sales (Aggregate) — Consumer Packaging Segment

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Consumer Packaging segment decreased $23.4 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to $431.1 million of higher selling price/mix that was partially offset by $273.1 million of lower volumes and $73.4 million of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. In addition, the prior year period included $103.7 million of net sales for converting operations now included in the Corrugated Packaging segment. Volumes were impacted by lower demand for certain of our products, as well as certain inventory rebalancing throughout the supply chain.

Adjusted EBITDA — Consumer Packaging Segment

Consumer Packaging segment Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 increased $6.5 million compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA in the period increased primarily due to an estimated $413.8 million margin impact from higher selling price/mix and $58.2 million of cost savings which were partially offset by an estimated $184.8 million of increased net cost inflation, $151.7 million of lower volumes and an estimated $44.0 million impact of economic downtime. Additionally, we had $85.0 million of other net unfavorable items that consisted primarily of $45.2 million of higher non-cash pension costs, $18.7 million of Adjusted EBITDA from the prior year period associated with the converting operations now included in the Corrugated Packaging segment and $12.0 million of unfavorable foreign exchange rates.

 Global Paper Segment

Global Paper Shipments

Global Paper shipments in thousands of tons include the sale of containerboard, paperboard, market pulp and specialty papers (including kraft papers and saturating kraft) to external customers. The shipment data table excludes gypsum paperboard liner tons produced by our Seven Hills mill joint venture in Lynchburg, VA (prior to its September 2023 sale) since it was not consolidated. We have presented the Global Paper shipments in this manner because we believe investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others find this breakout useful when evaluating our operating performance.

Net Sales before intersegment eliminations, also referred to as segment sales.

Net Sales (Aggregate) — Global Paper Segment

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Global Paper segment decreased $1.6 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to $1.4 billion of lower volumes and $34.6 million of lower selling price/mix. Additionally, net sales are $108.3 million lower than the prior year period as sales to the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition are now eliminated. Volumes were impacted by lower demand for certain of our products, as well as certain inventory rebalancing throughout the supply chain.

Adjusted EBITDA — Global Paper Segment

Global Paper segment Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 decreased $591.4 million compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA in the period decreased primarily due to $429.2 million of lower volumes, an estimated $223.6 million impact of economic downtime and prior year mill closures, and an estimated $19.2 million of increased net cost inflation. These items were partially offset by $121.8 million of cost savings and $22.6 million of margin impact from higher selling price/mix. Additionally, we had $63.8 million of other net unfavorable items that consisted primarily of $22.3 million of higher non-cash pension costs, $12.4 million of lower net ransomware recoveries and $9.3 million of lower net weather recoveries in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.

 Distribution Segment

Distribution Shipments

Distribution shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent in thousands of tons, which includes external and intersegment shipments from our distribution and display assembly operations. We have presented the Distribution shipments in this manner because we believe investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others find this breakout useful when evaluating our operating performance.

Net Sales before intersegment eliminations, also referred to as segment sales.

Net Sales (Aggregate) — Distribution Segment

Net sales before intersegment eliminations for the Distribution segment decreased $158.2 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to $173.7 million of lower volumes that was partially offset by $12.9 million of higher selling price/mix. The lower volumes were primarily due to lower moving and storage business volumes in fiscal 2023 and large healthcare orders in the prior year period.

In April 2023, one of our larger Distribution segment customers notified us that they were transitioning their business to a third party. We do not expect the impact on our consolidated operations to be material, although we expect the segment’s net sales and Adjusted EBITDA to be reduced until the sales are replaced.

Adjusted EBITDA — Distribution Segment

Distribution segment Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 decreased $42.7 million compared to the prior year primarily due to $48.9 million of lower volumes and an estimated $23.4 million of increased net cost inflation that were partially offset by $15.5 million of cost savings and an estimated $12.9 million of margin impact from higher selling price/mix.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We have funded our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, mergers, acquisitions and investments, restructuring activities, dividends and stock repurchases from net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable monetization agreements, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment removed from service and proceeds received in connection with the issuance of debt and equity securities. See “Note 14. Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for detailed information regarding our debt.

We are a party to enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023,

44

while others are considered future obligations. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of items such as long-term debt, including current portion, lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Obligations”, for additional information.

Cash and cash equivalents were $393.4 million at September 30, 2023 and $260.2 million at September 30, 2022. Approximately half of the cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2023 were held outside of the U.S. The proportion of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. generally varies from period to period. At September 30, 2023, total debt was $8.6 billion, $533.0 million of which was current. At September 30, 2022, total debt was $7.8 billion, $212.2 million of which was current. Included in our total debt at September 30, 2023 was $157.0 million of non-cash acquisition related step-up. During fiscal 2023, debt increased $0.8 billion primarily due to the Mexico Acquisition, net of debt repayments. See “Note 3. Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Funding for our domestic operations in the foreseeable future is expected to come from sources of liquidity within our domestic operations, including cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowings under our credit facilities. As such, our foreign cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be a key source of liquidity to our domestic operations.

At September 30, 2023, we had approximately $3.4 billion of available liquidity under our long-term committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents. Our primary availability is under our revolving credit facilities and Receivables Securitization Facility, the majority of which matures July 2027. This liquidity may be used to provide for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and dividends.

On September 22, 2023, we discharged $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% senior notes due September 2024 using cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our commercial paper program and recorded a $10.5 million gain on extinguishment of debt. On March 22, 2022, we redeemed $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior notes due March 2023 primarily using borrowings under our Receivables Securitization Facility and recorded an $8.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt.

Our credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants, including a covenant to satisfy a debt to capitalization ratio. We test and report our compliance with these covenants as required by these facilities and were in compliance with them as of September 30, 2023.

At September 30, 2023, we had $77.6 million of outstanding letters of credit not drawn upon.

We use a variety of working capital management strategies including supply chain financing ("SCF") programs, vendor financing and commercial card programs, monetization facilities where we sell short-term receivables to a group of third-party financial institutions and receivables securitization facilities. We describe these programs below.

We engage in certain customer-based SCF programs to accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding accounts receivables from certain customers. Certain costs of these programs are borne by the customer or us. Receivables transferred under these customer-based SCF programs generally meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 860, “Transfers and Servicing” (“ASC 860”), resulting in derecognition of such receivables from our consolidated balance sheets. Receivables involved with these customer-based SCF programs constitute approximately 2% of our annual net sales. In addition, we have monetization facilities that sell to third-party financial institutions all of the short-term receivables generated from certain customer trade accounts. See “Note 13. Fair Value — Accounts Receivable Monetization Agreements” for a discussion of our monetization facilities.

Our working capital management strategy includes working with our suppliers to revisit terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers generally range from payable upon receipt to 120 days and vary for items such as the availability of cash discounts. We do not believe our payment terms will be shortened significantly in the near future, and we do not expect our net cash provided by operating activities to be significantly impacted by additional extensions of payment terms. Certain financial institutions offer voluntary SCF programs that enable our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from us to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers. We and our suppliers agree on commercial terms for the goods

45

and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in SCF programs. The suppliers sell us goods or services and issue the associated invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. The due dates of the invoices are not extended due to the supplier’s participation in SCF programs. Our suppliers, at their sole discretion if they choose to participate in a SCF program, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial institutions. No guarantees are provided by us under SCF programs and we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program. Therefore, amounts due to our suppliers that elect to participate in SCF programs are included in the line items Accounts payable and Other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and the activity is reflected in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Based on correspondence with the financial institutions that are involved with our two primary SCF programs, while the amount suppliers elect to sell to the financial institutions varies from period to period, the amount generally averages approximately 19% to 21% of our accounts payable balance.

We also participate in certain vendor financing and commercial card programs to support our travel and entertainment expenses and smaller vendor purchases. Amounts outstanding under these programs are classified as debt primarily because we receive the benefit of extended payment terms and a rebate from the financial institution that we would not have otherwise received without the financial institution's involvement. We also have the Receivables Securitization Facility that allows for borrowing availability based on underlying accounts receivable eligibility and compliance with certain covenants. See “Note 14 Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our Receivables Securitization Facility and the amount outstanding under our vendor financing and commercial card programs.

Cash Flow Activity

----------------------------------------- ------------------------ -------- - ---- - -------- -
 Year Ended September 30,
(In millions) 2023 2022

Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,827.9 $ 2,020.4
Net cash used for investing activities $ (1,507.2 ) $ (776.0 )
Net cash used for financing activities $ (193.5 ) $ (1,281.3 )

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 decreased $192.5 million from fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower earnings partially offset by $668.0 million of reduced working capital usage compared to the prior year period. The changes in working capital in fiscal 2023 and 2022 included a use of cash of $32.5 million and a source of cash of $58.8 million, respectively, resulting from the sale of accounts receivables in connection with the Monetization Agreement (as defined in Note 13. Fair Value).

Net cash used for investing activities of $1,507.2 million in fiscal 2023 consisted primarily of $1,142.1 million for capital expenditures and $853.5 million of cash paid for the purchase of businesses, net of cash acquired which were partially offset by $318.2 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of our interior partitions converting operations and Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill, $53.4 million of proceeds from the sale of two joint ventures, $42.2 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance, $27.6 million of proceeds from the sale of two uncoated recycled paperboard mills, $23.2 million of proceeds from currency forward contracts and $26.8 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used for investing activities of $776.0 million in fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of $862.6 million for capital expenditures that was partially offset by $60.8 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance and $28.2 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily for the sale of a previously closed facility.

We invested $1,142.1 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2023, which was in line with the $1.0 to $1.1 billion we expected to invest. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024. We expect this level of capital investment will allow us to continue to invest in safety, environmental and maintenance projects, while also making investments to support productivity and growth in our business and complete certain asset recapitalization and to initiate strategic investments. However, our capital expenditure assumptions may change, project completion dates may change, or we may decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify, or changes in market conditions or to comply with changes in laws and regulations.

46

In fiscal 2023, net cash used for financing activities of $193.5 million consisted primarily of cash dividends paid to stockholders of $281.3 million that was partially offset by a net additions to debt of $101.1 million due to the Mexico Acquisition, net of debt repayments. In fiscal 2022, net cash used for financing activities of $1.3 billion consisted primarily of share repurchases of $600.0 million, a net decrease in debt of $452.7 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders of $259.5 million.

We estimate that we will invest approximately $103 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2024 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance. We were obligated to purchase approximately $353 million of fixed assets at September 30, 2023 for various capital projects.

At September 30, 2023, the U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and other U.S. federal and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately $41 million in future potential reductions of U.S. federal, state and foreign cash taxes. These items are primarily for foreign and state net operating losses and credits that generally will be utilized between fiscal 2024 and 2042. Our cash tax rate is highly dependent on our taxable income, utilization of net operating losses and credits, changes in tax laws or tax rates, capital expenditures and other factors. Barring significant changes in our current assumptions, including changes in tax laws or tax rates, forecasted taxable income, levels of capital expenditures and other items, we expect our fiscal 2024 cash tax rate will be approximately 13 percentage points higher than our expected income tax rate. The higher cash tax rate expected in fiscal 2024 is primarily due to the timing of depreciation on our qualifying capital investments as allowed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, new legislation requiring amortization of research and experimental costs instead of a full deduction in the year incurred and cash taxes due as a result of a deferred payment on the sale of RTS and Chattanooga. We expect our fiscal 2025 and 2026 cash tax rate to be approximately 5 percentage points higher than our income tax rate primarily due to the timing of depreciation on our qualifying capital investments as allowed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and legislation requiring amortization of research and experimental costs instead of a full deduction in the year incurred. These rates are subject to change for a variety of reasons, including as a result of consummation of the proposed Transaction.

During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we made contributions of $28.2 million and $21.2 million, respectively, to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. Based on current facts and assumptions, we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans in fiscal 2024. Based on current assumptions, including future interest rates, we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $22 million to $23 million annually in fiscal 2025 through 2028. We have made contributions and expect to continue to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the Pension Act and other regulations. The net overfunded status of our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at September 30, 2023 was $408.3 million. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In the normal course of business, we evaluate our potential exposure to MEPPs, including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities. In fiscal 2018, we submitted formal notification to withdraw from certain MEPPs, including PIUMPF, and recorded estimated withdrawal liabilities for each. We also have liabilities associated with other MEPPs from which we, or legacy companies, have withdrawn in the past. In fiscal 2024, we expect to pay approximately $11 million in withdrawal liabilities, excluding accumulated funding deficiency demands. With respect to certain other MEPPs, in the event we withdraw from one or more of the MEPPs in the future, it is reasonably possible that we may incur withdrawal liabilities in connection with such withdrawals. Our estimate of any such withdrawal liability, both individually and in the aggregate, is not material for the remaining plans in which we participate. At September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had recorded withdrawal liabilities of $203.2 million and $214.7 million, respectively, including liabilities associated with PIUMPF’s accumulated funding deficiency demands. The liability reduction in fiscal 2023 was primarily the result of non-PIUMPF arbitrations, the impact of which is reflected in Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense on our consolidated statements of operations. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans — Multiemployer Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In October 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3025 per share, representing a $1.21 per share annualized dividend or an increase of 10%. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 we paid an annual dividend of $1.10 per share, $1.00 per share and $0.88 per share, respectively. Our capital allocation strategy includes reducing debt and leverage and returning capital to stockholders through a sustainable and growing dividend.

47

In July 2015, our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 40.0 million shares of our Common Stock, representing approximately 15% of our outstanding Common Stock as of July 1, 2015. On May 4, 2022, our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program of up to 25.0 million shares of our Common Stock, plus any unutilized shares left from the July 2015 authorization. The 25.0 million shares represented an additional authorization of approximately 10% of our outstanding Common Stock. Shares of our Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. In fiscal 2023, we had no share repurchases. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $597.5 million. In fiscal 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $125.1 million. The amount reflected as repurchased in the consolidated statements of cash flows varies due to the timing of share settlement. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 29.0 million shares of Common Stock available for repurchase under the program, although we have indefinitely suspended the program in light of the proposed Transaction (and related restrictions imposed by the Transaction Agreement).

The Transaction Agreement provides that we will generally continue to conduct our business in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice in all material respects. It also contains covenants that restrict our ability to undertake certain actions without consent from Smurfit Kappa, including incurrence of debt or modification of existing debt arrangements under certain circumstances. Subject to these restrictions, we anticipate funding our capital expenditures, debt service obligations, dividends, pension payments, working capital needs, restructuring activities and other corporate actions for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from our accounts receivable monetization agreements, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and other debt financing. In addition, we regularly review our capital structure and conditions in the private and public debt markets in order to optimize our mix of indebtedness. In connection with these reviews, and subject to restrictions imposed in the Transaction Agreement, we may seek to refinance existing indebtedness to extend maturities, reduce borrowing costs or otherwise improve the terms and composition of our indebtedness.

Contractual Obligations

We summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at September 30, 2023, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table. Certain amounts in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors, including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Because these estimates and assumptions are subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those presented in the table (in millions).

Includes only principal payments owed on our debt assuming that all of our long-term debt will be held to maturity, excluding scheduled payments. We have excluded $123.6 million of fair value of debt step-up, deferred financing costs and unamortized bond discounts from the table to arrive at actual debt obligations. See “Note 14. Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the interest rates that apply to our various debt instruments.

(2)
See “Note 15. Leases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(3)
Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provision; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.

48

(4)
We have included future estimated minimum pension plan contributions, MEPP withdrawal payments with definite payout terms and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Our estimates are based on various factors, such as discount rates and expected returns on plan assets. Future contributions are subject to changes in our funded status based on factors such as investment performance, discount rates, returns on plan assets and changes in legislation. It is possible that our assumptions may change, actual market performance may vary or we may decide to contribute different amounts. We have excluded $94.7 million of MEPP withdrawal liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2023, including our estimate of the accumulated funding deficiency, due to lack of definite payout terms for certain of the obligations. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans – Multiemployer Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(5)
We have not included the following items in the table:

•
An item labeled “other noncurrent liabilities” reflected on our consolidated balance sheet because these liabilities do not have a defined pay-out schedule.

•
$476.9 million for certain provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” associated with liabilities, primarily for uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of payment, if any.

•
$1,106.9 million of non-recourse liabilities held by special purpose entities ("SPEs") that have $1,244.8 million of related restricted assets. See “Note 17. Special Purpose Entities” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations presented in the table above, we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business. These contracts, however, are subject to change based on our business decisions.

Upon issuance, the Notes maturing in 2025, 2027 and March 2028 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by two other wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent: WestRock RKT, LLC (“RKT”) and WestRock MWV, LLC (“MWV”, and together with RKT, the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”). Parent has also fully and unconditionally guaranteed these Notes. The remaining Notes were issued by the Issuer subsequent to the consummation of the acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation in November 2018 and were fully and unconditionally guaranteed at the time of issuance by the Parent and the Guarantor Subsidiaries. Accordingly, each series of the Notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the Parent and the Guarantor Subsidiaries (together, the “Guarantors”). Collectively, the Issuer and the Guarantors are the “Obligor Group”.

Each series of Notes and the related guarantees constitute unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the applicable obligor. Each series of Notes and the related guarantees ranks equally in right of payment with all of the applicable obligor’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt; ranks senior in right of payment to all of the applicable obligor’s existing and future subordinated debt; is effectively junior to the applicable obligor’s existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt; and is structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities of each subsidiary of the applicable obligor (that is not itself an obligor) that does not guarantee such Notes.

The indentures governing each series of Notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to grant liens on our assets and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition,

49

the indentures limit, as applicable, the ability of the Issuer and Guarantors to merge, consolidate or sell, convey, transfer or lease our or their properties and assets substantially as an entirety under certain circumstances. The covenants contained in the indentures do not restrict the Company’s ability to pay dividends or distributions to stockholders.

The guarantee obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes are also subject to certain limitations and terms similar to those applicable to other guarantees of similar instruments, including that (i) the guarantees are subject to fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws and (ii) the obligations of each Guarantor under its guarantee of each series of Notes will be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its guarantee of such Notes not to be deemed to constitute a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law.

Under each indenture governing one or more series of the Notes, a Guarantor Subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released from its guarantee upon consummation of any transaction permitted under the applicable indenture resulting in such Guarantor Subsidiary ceasing to be an obligor (either as issuer or guarantor). Under the indentures, the guarantee of the Parent will be automatically released and will terminate upon the merger of the Parent with or into the Issuer or another guarantor, the consolidation of the Parent with the Issuer or another guarantor or the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent to the Issuer or a guarantor. In addition, if the Issuer exercises its defeasance or covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes of a series in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture, each guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released from its guarantee of the Notes of such series and all its obligations under the applicable indenture.

The Issuer and each Guarantor are holding companies that conduct substantially all of their business through subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of the Issuer’s indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by the Issuer’s and each Guarantor’s subsidiaries, as applicable, and their ability to make such cash available to the Issuer and the Guarantors, as applicable, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. The Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable them to make payments in respect of their obligations, including with respect to the Notes in the case of the Issuer and the guarantees in the case of the Guarantors. Each of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ ability to obtain cash from their subsidiaries. In the event that the Issuer and the Guarantors do not receive distributions from their subsidiaries, the Issuer and the Guarantors may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on their obligations, including with respect to the Notes and the guarantees.

Pursuant to amended Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, the summarized financial information below is presented for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the Obligor Group and equity in earnings from and investments in the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. The summarized financial information below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements contained herein, as the summarized financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities (in millions).

DEFINITIONS AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Definitions

We calculate cost savings as the year-over-year change in certain costs incurred for manufacturing, procurement, logistics, and SG&A, in each case excluding the impact of economic downtime and inflation. Cost savings achieved to date may not recur in future periods, and estimates of future savings are subject to change.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). However, management believes certain non-GAAP financial measures provide additional meaningful financial information that may be relevant when assessing our ongoing performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies.

We use the non-GAAP financial measures “Adjusted Net Income” and “Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share”. Management believes these measures provide our management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because they exclude restructuring and other costs, net, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business. We and our board of directors use this information when making financial, operating and planning decisions and when evaluating our performance relative to other periods. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measures to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share are Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders and (Loss) earnings per diluted share, respectively. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Business Systems Transformation” for additional information regarding our business systems transformation.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share to (Loss) earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure (in dollars per share) for the periods indicated.

The “Losses at closed facilities” line for the year ended September 30, 2022, includes $1.2 million of depreciation and amortization.

We discuss certain of these charges in more detail in “Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net”, “Note 8. Segment Information” and “Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies — Indirect Tax Claim”. For more information on our business systems transformation see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Business Systems Transformation”.

We also use the non-GAAP financial measure “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA”, along with other measures such as Adjusted EBITDA (a GAAP measure of segment performance our CODM uses to evaluate our segment results), to evaluate our overall performance. The composition of Adjusted EBITDA is not addressed or prescribed by GAAP.

Management believes that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is "Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders". Management believes this measure provides our management, board of directors, investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because it excludes restructuring and other costs, net, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, Gain on sale of RTS and Chattanooga, business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business.

The table above adds back expense or subtracts income for certain financial statement and segment footnote items to compute Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.

The non-GAAP measure Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA can also be derived by adding together each segment's "Adjusted EBITDA" plus "Non-allocated expenses" from our segment footnote. See “Note 8. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported. Certain significant accounting policies are described in “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

These critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management’s most subjective and complex judgments. The accounting for these

54

matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts, circumstances and assumptions that, in management’s judgment, could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and, accordingly, could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates.

Goodwill

We review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value as set forth in ASC 350, “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other” ("ASC 350"). We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component.

ASC 350 allows an optional qualitative assessment, prior to a quantitative assessment test, to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. We generally do not attempt a qualitative assessment and move directly to the quantitative test. As part of the quantitative test, we utilize the present value of expected cash flows or, as appropriate, a combination of the present value of expected cash flows and the guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. This present value model requires management to estimate future cash flows, the timing of these cash flows, and a discount rate (based on a weighted average cost of capital), which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows. Factors that management must estimate when performing this step in the process include, among other items, sales volume, prices, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions that the reporting units use for internal planning purposes, which we believe would be generally consistent with that of a market participant. If we determine that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If we determine that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we measure the goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, but not in excess of the total amount of goodwill allocated to the respective reporting unit, as required under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”. We describe our accounting policy for goodwill further in “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Goodwill” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $1,893.0 million ($1,821.8 million after-tax) associated with our interim goodwill impairment analysis completed in the second quarter. See “Note 8. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing. We considered factors such as, but not limited to, our expectations for macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and financial performance, including planned revenue, earnings and capital investments of each reporting unit. The discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 9.5% to 14.5%. We used perpetual growth rates ranging from 0.0% to 1.0%. All reporting units that have goodwill were noted to have a fair value that exceeded their carrying values. The fair value of our Consumer Packaging reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 30%. However, our Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units had fair values that exceeded their respective carrying values by less than 10%. Our Corrugated Packaging reporting unit had a narrow fair value cushion due to the goodwill impairment charge recorded for the reporting unit in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and the fair value accounting related to the Mexico Acquisition.

If we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis points, the fair value of only our Consumer Packaging reporting unit would have continued to exceed its carrying value. In our fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment analysis, projected future cash flows for the Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units were discounted at 9.5% and 14.5%, respectively. Based on the discounted cash flow model and holding other valuation assumptions constant, the discount rates for Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units would have to be increased to 9.9% and 15.4%, respectively, in order for the estimated fair value of the reporting units to fall below their carrying values.

At September 30, 2023, the Corrugated Packaging, Consumer Packaging and Distribution reporting units had $2,603.7 million, $1,506.6 million and $138.4 million of goodwill, respectively. Our Global Paper reporting unit had no goodwill. Because the fair values of the Corrugated Packaging and Distribution reporting units are not substantially more than their carrying values, these reporting units have greater risk of future impairments should

55

we experience adverse changes in our assumptions, estimates, or market factors. If the assumptions, estimates, and market factors underlying our fair value determinations change adversely, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges, which could be material. Additionally, there are certain risks inherent to our operations as described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors”.

Subsequent to our annual test, we monitored industry economic trends through the end of fiscal 2023 and determined no additional testing for goodwill impairment was warranted. We have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years.

 Long-Lived Assets

We follow the provisions included in ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” in determining whether the carrying value of any of our long-lived assets, including amortizable intangibles other than goodwill, is impaired. We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset might not be recoverable. If we determine that indicators of impairment are present, we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the potentially impaired assets are less than the carrying value. This requires management to estimate future cash flows through operations over the remaining useful life of the asset and its ultimate disposition. The assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions we use for internal planning purposes, updated to reflect current expectations. If our estimated undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, we estimate the fair value of the asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the asset. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flows, observable prices for similar assets, or other valuation techniques.

Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and operational performance. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired. Evaluating impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows, which also require judgment by management.

Accounting for Income Taxes

Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances, if any. We use significant judgment in (i) determining whether a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination and (ii) measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is “more likely than not” to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We do not record any benefit for the tax positions where we do not meet the “more likely than not” initial recognition threshold. Income tax positions must meet a “more likely than not” recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized. We generally recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Resolution of the uncertain tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or materially benefit our results of operations in future periods depending upon their ultimate resolution. A 1% change in our effective tax rate would have increased or decreased tax expense by approximately $17 million for fiscal 2023. A 1% change in our effective tax rate used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets, as recorded on the September 30, 2023 consolidated balance sheet, would have increased or decreased tax expense by approximately $100 million for fiscal 2023.

Pension

The funded status of our qualified and non-qualified U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans increased $170.5 million in fiscal 2023. Our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans were overfunded by $450.0 million as of September 30, 2023. Our non-U.S. pension plans were under funded by $41.7 million as of September 30, 2023. Our U.S. pension plan benefit obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2023 primarily by a 61-basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date. The non-U.S. pension plan obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2023 by a 73-basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date.

56

 The determination of pension obligations and pension expense requires various assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts, such as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, projected future compensation increases and mortality rates for each of our plans. These assumptions are determined annually in conjunction with our actuary. The accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts, circumstances and assumptions that, in management’s judgment, could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and, accordingly, could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates.

A 25-basis point change in the discount rate, compensation level, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and interest crediting rate, factoring in our corridor (as defined herein) as appropriate, would have had the following effect on fiscal 2023 pension expense (amounts in the table in parentheses reflect additional income, in millions):

------------------------------------------------ --------------------- ----- - --------------------- - ---- -
 Pension Plans
 25 BasisPointIncrease 25 BasisPointDecrease
Discount rate $ (8.1 ) $ 8.3
Compensation level $ 0.2 $ (0.2 )
Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets $ (12.2 ) $ 12.2
Interest crediting rate $ 0.3 $ (0.3 )

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes as well as the risk factors included in Item 1A.

Strategic Portfolio Actions

We are committed to improving our return on invested capital as well as maximizing the performance of our assets. From time to time, we have completed acquisitions that have expanded our product and geographic scope, allowed us to increase our integration levels and impacted our comparative financials. Subject to restrictions in the Transaction Agreement, we expect to continue to evaluate potential transactions in the future, although their size may vary.

On December 1, 2022, we completed the Mexico Acquisition for $969.8 million in cash and the assumption of debt. We accounted for this acquisition as a business combination resulting in its consolidation. The acquiree is a leading integrated producer of fiber-based sustainable packaging solutions that operates four paper mills, nine corrugated packaging plants and six high graphic plants throughout Mexico, producing sustainable packaging for a wide range of end markets in the region. This acquisition is expected to provide us with further geographic and end market diversification as well as position us to continue to grow in the Latin American market. We have included the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition in our Corrugated Packaging segment. In conjunction with our Mexico Acquisition, we also moved certain existing consumer converting operations in Latin America into our Corrugated Packaging segment in line with how we are managing the business effective January 1, 2023. We did not recast prior year results related to these operations as they were not material. However, we have disclosed those impacts in the respective results of operations section below. See “Note 3. Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

As of December 31, 2022, construction in progress also includes $2.18 billion of servers and network assets components stored by our suppliers until required by our design manufacturers to fulfill certain purchase orders. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $8.50 billion, $7.56 billion, and $6.39 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The majority of the property and equipment depreciation expense was from servers and network assets depreciation of $5.29 billion, $4.94 billion, and $4.38 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. For additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful life of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $1.34 billion abandonment charge and $508 million impairment loss for data center assets and leasehold improvements assets, respectively, as a result of our restructuring efforts. For additional information, see Note 3 -- Restructuring.

['s Adjusted EBITDA, we highlight the segment to which the charges relate. See “Note 5. Restructuring and Other Costs, Net” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a description of the type of costs incurred. We have restructured portions of our operations from time to time, have current restructuring initiatives taking place, and it is likely that we will engage in future restructuring activities.

Impairment of Goodwill and Mineral Rights

In fiscal 2023, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment of $1.9 billion, with $1.4 billion and $0.5 billion in the Global Paper and Corrugated Packaging reportable segments, respectively. The impairment is not included in Adjusted EBITDA of our segments. See “Note 8. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $26.0 million pre-tax non-cash impairment of certain mineral rights driven by a lack of new leasing or development activity on the related properties for an extended period of time. With the impairment, we had no value assigned to our remaining mineral rights.

Interest Expense, net

Interest expense, net was $417.9 million and $318.8 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest expense increased $159.5 million and was partially offset by increased interest income of $60.4 million. The net increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates on debt in the current year period and increased debt associated with the Mexico Acquisition. These increases were partially offset by higher interest income on our cash in fiscal 2023. Additionally, fiscal 2022 included a $36.2 million reduction in interest expense associated with the remeasurement of our multiemployer pension liabilities for the change in interest rates.

Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt

In fiscal 2023, gain on extinguishment of debt was $10.5 million and in fiscal 2022, loss on extinguishment of debt was $8.5 million. In fiscal 2023, we discharged $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.00% senior notes due September 2024 using cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our commercial paper program.

38

 The loss in fiscal 2022 was primarily related to the redemption of $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.00% senior notes due March 2023 primarily using borrowings under our Receivables Securitization Facility (as hereinafter defined).

Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service (Cost) Income

Pension and other postretirement non-service cost in fiscal 2023 was $21.8 million compared to income of $157.4 million in fiscal 2022. The higher costs in fiscal 2023 were primarily due to lower plan assets at September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year, partially offset by an increase in the expected return on plan assets at September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year. These costs were also increased due to higher interest rates during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Customary pension and other postretirement cost (income) are included in our segment results. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Other (Expense) Income, net

Other (expense) income, net was expense of $6.1 million and expense of $11.0 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The lower net expense in fiscal 2023 primarily included a favorable $13.7 million impact of foreign currency, a favorable $12.0 million of other non-operating costs and a favorable $7.3 million on the sale of businesses, each as compared to fiscal 2022. These items were partially offset by $27.9 million of increased expense in connection with the sale of receivables. The favorable other non-operating costs included a $19.7 million gain on foreign currency exchange contract derivatives entered into in anticipation of the Mexico Acquisition, and the favorable sale of businesses included an $11.2 million gain on the sale of our Eaton, IN and Aurora, IL uncoated recycled paperboard mills.

Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities

Equity in income of unconsolidated entities in fiscal 2023 was income of $3.4 million compared to income of $72.9 million in fiscal 2022. The decline in income in fiscal 2023 was driven by a $46.8 million non-cash, pre-tax loss to recognize the write-off of historical foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as well as the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid for the Mexico Acquisition and the carrying value of our prior ownership interest. That loss was partially offset by the $19.3 million pre-tax gain on sale of our displays joint venture and a $7.6 million pre-tax gain on sale of our Seven Hills mill joint venture. Additionally, the change year-over-year was impacted by no longer recording equity income after the purchase of our remaining interest in the operations acquired in the Mexico Acquisition and stronger performance by the displays joint venture in the prior year period. See “Note 3. Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga

In fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our interior partitions converting operations and the sale of our Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill to our joint venture partner and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of $238.8 million, excluding divestiture costs. Divestiture costs are expensed as incurred and recorded within Restructuring and other costs, net. See “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Description of Business” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Provision for Income Taxes

We recorded an income tax benefit of $60.4 million for fiscal 2023 at an effective tax rate benefit of 3.5%, compared to income tax expense of $269.6 million at an effective tax rate of 22.1% in fiscal 2022. The low tax rate in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to the tax effects related to the goodwill impairment. See “Note 7. Income Taxes” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including a table reconciling the statutory federal tax rate to our effective tax rate.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Corrugated Packaging Segment

Corrugated Packaging Shipments

Corrugated Packaging shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent in thousands of tons, which includes external and intersegment shipments from our corrugated converting operations, principally for the sale of corrugated containers and other corrugated products. Tons sold from period to period may be impacted by customer conversions to lower basis weight products. In addition, we disclose North American Corrugated Packaging shipments in billion square feet (“BSF”) and millions of square feet ("]:
(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

Cash Flow Activity

----------------------------------------- ------------------------ -------- - ---- - -------- -
 Year Ended September 30,
(In millions) 2023 2022

Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,827.9 $ 2,020.4
Net cash used for investing activities $ (1,507.2 ) $ (776.0 )
Net cash used for financing activities $ (193.5 ) $ (1,281.3 )

Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 decreased $192.5 million from fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower earnings partially offset by $668.0 million of reduced working capital usage compared to the prior year period. The changes in working capital in fiscal 2023 and 2022 included a use of cash of $32.5 million and a source of cash of $58.8 million, respectively, resulting from the sale of accounts receivables in connection with the Monetization Agreement (as defined in Note 13. Fair Value).

Net cash used for investing activities of $1,507.2 million in fiscal 2023 consisted primarily of $1,142.1 million for capital expenditures and $853.5 million of cash paid for the purchase of businesses, net of cash acquired which were partially offset by $318.2 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of our interior partitions converting operations and Chattanooga, TN uncoated recycled paperboard mill, $53.4 million of proceeds from the sale of two joint ventures, $42.2 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance, $27.6 million of proceeds from the sale of two uncoated recycled paperboard mills, $23.2 million of proceeds from currency forward contracts and $26.8 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used for investing activities of $776.0 million in fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of $862.6 million for capital expenditures that was partially offset by $60.8 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance and $28.2 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, primarily for the sale of a previously closed facility.

We invested $1,142.1 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2023, which was in line with the $1.0 to $1.1 billion we expected to invest. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2024. We expect this level of capital investment will allow us to continue to invest in safety, environmental and maintenance projects, while also making investments to support productivity and growth in our business and complete certain asset recapitalization and to initiate strategic investments. However, our capital expenditure assumptions may change, project completion dates may change, or we may decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify, or changes in market conditions or to comply with changes in laws and regulations.

46

In fiscal 2023, net cash used for financing activities of $193.5 million consisted primarily of cash dividends paid to stockholders of $281.3 million that was partially offset by a net additions to debt of $101.1 million due to the Mexico Acquisition, net of debt repayments. In fiscal 2022, net cash used for financing activities of $1.3 billion consisted primarily of share repurchases of $600.0 million, a net decrease in debt of $452.7 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders of $259.5 million.

We estimate that we will invest approximately $103 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2024 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance. We were obligated to purchase approximately $353 million of fixed assets at September 30, 2023 for various capital projects.

At September 30, 2023, the U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating losses and other U.S. federal and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately $41 million in future potential reductions of U.S. federal, state and foreign cash taxes. These items are primarily for foreign and state net operating losses and credits that generally will be utilized between fiscal 2024 and 2042. Our cash tax rate is highly dependent on our taxable income, utilization of net operating losses and credits, changes in tax laws or tax rates, capital expenditures and other factors. Barring significant changes in our current assumptions, including changes in tax laws or tax rates, forecasted taxable income, levels of capital expenditures and other items, we expect our fiscal 2024 cash tax rate will be approximately 13 percentage points higher than our expected income tax rate. The higher cash tax rate expected in fiscal 2024 is primarily due to the timing of depreciation on our qualifying capital investments as allowed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, new legislation requiring amortization of research and experimental costs instead of a full deduction in the year incurred and cash taxes due as a result of a deferred payment on the sale of RTS and Chattanooga. We expect our fiscal 2025 and 2026 cash tax rate to be approximately 5 percentage points higher than our income tax rate primarily due to the timing of depreciation on our qualifying capital investments as allowed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and legislation requiring amortization of research and experimental costs instead of a full deduction in the year incurred. These rates are subject to change for a variety of reasons, including as a result of consummation of the proposed Transaction.

During fiscal 2023 and 2022, we made contributions of $28.2 million and $21.2 million, respectively, to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. Based on current facts and assumptions, we expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans in fiscal 2024. Based on current assumptions, including future interest rates, we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $22 million to $23 million annually in fiscal 2025 through 2028. We have made contributions and expect to continue to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the Pension Act and other regulations. The net overfunded status of our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans at September 30, 2023 was $408.3 million. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In the normal course of business, we evaluate our potential exposure to MEPPs, including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities. In fiscal 2018, we submitted formal notification to withdraw from certain MEPPs, including PIUMPF, and recorded estimated withdrawal liabilities for each. We also have liabilities associated with other MEPPs from which we, or legacy companies, have withdrawn in the past. In fiscal 2024, we expect to pay approximately $11 million in withdrawal liabilities, excluding accumulated funding deficiency demands. With respect to certain other MEPPs, in the event we withdraw from one or more of the MEPPs in the future, it is reasonably possible that we may incur withdrawal liabilities in connection with such withdrawals. Our estimate of any such withdrawal liability, both individually and in the aggregate, is not material for the remaining plans in which we participate. At September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we had recorded withdrawal liabilities of $203.2 million and $214.7 million, respectively, including liabilities associated with PIUMPF’s accumulated funding deficiency demands. The liability reduction in fiscal 2023 was primarily the result of non-PIUMPF arbitrations, the impact of which is reflected in Multiemployer pension withdrawal (income) expense on our consolidated statements of operations. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans — Multiemployer Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In October 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3025 per share, representing a $1.21 per share annualized dividend or an increase of 10%. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 we paid an annual dividend of $1.10 per share, $1.00 per share and $0.88 per share, respectively. Our capital allocation strategy includes reducing debt and leverage and returning capital to stockholders through a sustainable and growing dividend.

47

In July 2015, our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 40.0 million shares of our Common Stock, representing approximately 15% of our outstanding Common Stock as of July 1, 2015. On May 4, 2022, our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program of up to 25.0 million shares of our Common Stock, plus any unutilized shares left from the July 2015 authorization. The 25.0 million shares represented an additional authorization of approximately 10% of our outstanding Common Stock. Shares of our Common Stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions. In fiscal 2023, we had no share repurchases. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 12.6 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $597.5 million. In fiscal 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate cost of $125.1 million. The amount reflected as repurchased in the consolidated statements of cash flows varies due to the timing of share settlement. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately 29.0 million shares of Common Stock available for repurchase under the program, although we have indefinitely suspended the program in light of the proposed Transaction (and related restrictions imposed by the Transaction Agreement).

The Transaction Agreement provides that we will generally continue to conduct our business in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice in all material respects. It also contains covenants that restrict our ability to undertake certain actions without consent from Smurfit Kappa, including incurrence of debt or modification of existing debt arrangements under certain circumstances. Subject to these restrictions, we anticipate funding our capital expenditures, debt service obligations, dividends, pension payments, working capital needs, restructuring activities and other corporate actions for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from our accounts receivable monetization agreements, proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and other debt financing. In addition, we regularly review our capital structure and conditions in the private and public debt markets in order to optimize our mix of indebtedness. In connection with these reviews, and subject to restrictions imposed in the Transaction Agreement, we may seek to refinance existing indebtedness to extend maturities, reduce borrowing costs or otherwise improve the terms and composition of our indebtedness.

Contractual Obligations

We summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at September 30, 2023, and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table. Certain amounts in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors, including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Because these estimates and assumptions are subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those presented in the table (in millions).

Includes only principal payments owed on our debt assuming that all of our long-term debt will be held to maturity, excluding scheduled payments. We have excluded $123.6 million of fair value of debt step-up, deferred financing costs and unamortized bond discounts from the table to arrive at actual debt obligations. See “Note 14. Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the interest rates that apply to our various debt instruments.

See “Note 15. Leases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(3)
Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provision; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.

(4)
We have included future estimated minimum pension plan contributions, MEPP withdrawal payments with definite payout terms and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations, supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans. Our estimates are based on various factors, such as discount rates and expected returns on plan assets. Future contributions are subject to changes in our funded status based on factors such as investment performance, discount rates, returns on plan assets and changes in legislation. It is possible that our assumptions may change, actual market performance may vary or we may decide to contribute different amounts. We have excluded $94.7 million of MEPP withdrawal liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2023, including our estimate of the accumulated funding deficiency, due to lack of definite payout terms for certain of the obligations. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans – Multiemployer Plans” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

(5)
We have not included the following items in the table:

•
An item labeled “other noncurrent liabilities” reflected on our consolidated balance sheet because these liabilities do not have a defined pay-out schedule.

•
$476.9 million for certain provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” associated with liabilities, primarily for uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of payment, if any.

•
$1,106.9 million of non-recourse liabilities held by special purpose entities ("]:

["Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Goodwill” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. In addition, the decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes excluding the Mexico Acquisition, the impact of increased economic downtime and prior year mill closures, higher restructuring costs, estimated increased cost inflation, increased non-cash pension costs, higher net interest expense, business systems transformation costs and the loss recorded in connection with the Mexico Acquisition. These items were partially offset by the impact of higher selling price/mix, cost savings, the Gain on Sale of RTS and Chattanooga, the contribution from the Mexico Acquisition, and the gain on sale of unconsolidated entities. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion in fiscal 2023 decreased $480.8 million, or 13.9%, compared to fiscal 2022.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect a decline in net sales and earnings from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, reflecting the normal seasonal sequential volume declines in many of our businesses, continued realization of published price declines and scheduled mill maintenance outages. We plan to continue balancing our supply with our customers’ demand. We expect sequentially higher recycled fiber costs, lower chemical costs and relatively flat energy, virgin fiber and freight costs. We also expect increased health insurance costs prior to the annual reset of employee deductibles.

In fiscal 2024, we expect financial results to be favorably weighted to the back half of the year due to seasonality and the expected improvement in demand trends. We expect continued realization of published price declines, continued balancing of our supply with our customers’ demand, higher costs driven by higher recycled fiber, freight and wages and other costs, and lower energy, virgin fiber and chemical costs. We also expect our results to be negatively impacted by scheduled mill maintenance outages. We expect approximately 550,000 tons of maintenance downtime compared to approximately 507,000 tons in fiscal 2023. We expect to further progress on cost savings initiatives and are targeting $300 to $400 million in cost savings in fiscal 2024. We expect to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other costs in connection with the proposed Transaction. As noted above, in fiscal 2024, we also expect the aggregate investment in our business systems transformation to be approximately $220 million, approximately $90 million of which we expect to expense as incurred. We expect fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. We expect our fiscal 2024 cash tax rate will be higher than our expected income tax rate. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Cash Flow Activity” for additional information.

RANSOMWARE INCIDENT

As previously disclosed, on January 23, 2021, we detected a ransomware incident impacting certain of our systems. Promptly upon our detection of this incident, we initiated response and containment protocols and our security teams, supplemented by leading cyber defense firms, worked to remediate this incident. These actions included taking preventative measures, such as shutting down certain systems out of an abundance of caution, as well as taking steps to supplement existing security monitoring, scanning and protective measures. In our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we announced that all systems were back in service.

In fiscal 2022 and 2023, we realized incremental progress against our resiliency objectives. We improved our mean-time-to-resolve security incidents, optimized our endpoint detection and response technology deployments across all of our workstation and server population, transitioned all of our local drives to cloud-based storage, and progressed against key goals to modernize the security and infrastructure of our operating locations. In fiscal 2024, we expect to further advance the maturity of our resiliency posture by continuing to execute against our multi-year roadmap. Quarterly progress, as well as key risks and issues, are reported to the Audit Committee for oversight and monitoring.

In fiscal 2023, we received $10 million of business interruption insurance recoveries related to the ransomware incident, which we recorded as a reduction of Cost of goods sold and presented in net cash provided by operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our recoveries related to the ransomware incident are now complete. In fiscal 2022, we recorded a $57.2 million credit for ransomware insurance recoveries, recording $50.6 million of business interruption recoveries as a reduction of Cost of goods sold and $6.6 million of direct cost recoveries as a reduction of SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization. We present ransomware recoveries received as Net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.

Net Sales (Unaffiliated Customers)

Net sales in fiscal 2023 of $20.3 billion decreased $946.5 million, or 4.5%, compared to fiscal 2022 primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, which were largely offset by increased sales due to the Mexico Acquisition and higher selling price/mix.

See “Segment Information” below for detailed information regarding the change in net sales before intersegment eliminations by segment.

Cost of Goods Sold

Cost of goods sold decreased to $16.7 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $17.2 billion in fiscal 2022. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 82.4% in fiscal 2023 compared to 81.1% in fiscal 2022. The dollar decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily due to lower volumes and the impact of cost savings which were partially offset by the impact of estimated increased net cost inflation. Net cost inflation consisted primarily of higher wage and benefit costs, chemical costs, freight costs and virgin fiber costs which were partially offset by lower recycled fiber costs and energy costs including hedges.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense Excluding Intangible Amortization

SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization increased $81.8 million to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2022. SG&A expense excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal 2023 to 9.9% from 9.1% in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to $93.2 million related to the Mexico Acquisition and $90.5 million of business systems transformation costs. Travel and entertainment expense also increased by $19.4 million. Excluding these items, compensation and benefit costs were $117.3 million lower, reflecting cost savings and achievement of lower performance goals compared to the prior year period.

37

Selling, General and Administrative Intangible Amortization Expense

SG&A intangible amortization expense was $341.5 million and $350.4 million in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The expense primarily represents the amortization of customer relationship intangibles acquired in business combinations.

Multiemployer Pension Withdrawal (Income) Expense

In fiscal 2023 we recorded multiemployer pension withdrawal income of $12.1 million related to non-PIUMPF arbitrations. In fiscal 2022, we recorded multiemployer pension withdrawal expense of $0.2 million. See “Note 6. Retirement Plans — MEPPs” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Restructuring and Other Costs, Net

We recorded pre-tax restructuring and other costs, net of $859.2 million and $383.0 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of these costs, $604.6 million and $334.1 million for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, were non-cash. The charges in fiscal 2023 were primarily associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Tacoma, WA and North Charleston, SC containerboard mills, and the charges in fiscal 2022 were primarily associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our Panama City, FL mill and the permanent closure of the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our St. Paul, MN mill. In addition, in both years we incurred charges for other facility closure activities, reduction in workforce actions and charges associated with acquisition, integration or divestiture activities.

These amounts are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with a given restructuring, acquisition, integration or divestiture vary. We generally expect the integration of a closed facility’s assets and production with other facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility. While restructuring costs are not charged to our segments and, therefore, do not reduce each segment']:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

We have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities reported. Certain significant accounting policies are described in “Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

These critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management’s most subjective and complex judgments. The accounting for these

54

matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts, circumstances and assumptions that, in management’s judgment, could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and, accordingly, could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates.

Goodwill

We review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value as set forth in ASC 350, “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other” ("]:
