ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained herein.
We are an energy technology company with a broad and diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We operate through our two business segments: Oilfield Services & Equipment ("OFSE") and Industrial & Energy Technology ("IET"). We sell products and services primarily in the global oil and gas markets, within the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Baker Hughes was successful in 2022, with key commercial successes and solid margin improvements in OFSE. Commercially in IET, orders performance in LNG and new energy hit new highs and are poised to remain strong into 2023. In 2022, we had a record year for LNG equipment orders, and achieved significant growth in new energy orders compared to 2021. Within OFSE, Subsea & Surface Pressure Systems also achieved a strong orders year compared to 2021.
Operationally, our performance for 2022 was mixed. During the year, we experienced several operational challenges across our organization most notably cost inflation, supply chain delays, impact of foreign exchange, and the suspension of our activities in Russia. Our performance improved over the second half of 2022 as supply chain challenges moderated, we saw increased activity primarily in OFSE, and we were able to achieve price improvements that collectively more than offset these operational challenges.
In 2022, we generated revenue of $21.2 billion, compared to $20.5 billion in 2021. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher volume in OFSE. Operating income in 2022 was $1,185 million compared to $1,310 million in 2021. The decrease in operating income was driven by higher restructuring, impairment and other charges, partially offset by higher segment operating income in OFSE. Income before income taxes was $22 million in 2022, and included other non-operating losses of $911 million and net interest expense of $252 million. Included in our other non-operating loss was a $451 million loss from the sale of part of the OFSE Russia business, and $265 million of unrealized net losses from marking our investments in ADNOC Drilling and C3 AI to fair value.
In the third quarter of 2022, we announced a reorganization of the Company to create two operating segments, OFSE and IET. This has kicked off a major transformation effort across the organization, including key management changes, which will fundamentally improve the way the Company operates. This reorganization is designed to simplify and streamline our organizational structure, and create better flexibility and economies of scale across the two operating segments. For OFSE, one area of focus will be right sizing OFSE through facility rationalization, removing management layers, and integrating multiple functions and capabilities. For IET, we expect commercial and technological benefits from closer integration as well as the benefit of cost out programs. We expect these changes to improve the long-term optionality and growth opportunities for Baker Hughes as our markets and customers continue to evolve.
Baker Hughes remains committed to a flexible capital allocation policy that balances returning cash to shareholders and investing in growth opportunities. We increased our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2022 by one cent to $0.19 per share. For the full year of 2022, we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest in the Baker Hughes portfolio through strategic acquisitions and early-stage new energy investments. In 2022, we made several strategic acquisitions that will complement our current portfolio. Such acquisitions include the Power Generation division of BRUSH Group (“BRUSH”). BRUSH is an established equipment manufacturer that specializes in electric power generation and management for the industrial and energy sectors, which will complement the IET existing portfolio. Other transactions include the acquisitions of Quest Integrity, which will enhance our inspection capabilities, and AccessESP, which broadens our electrical submersible pump ("ESP") technology portfolio. New energy investments include Mosaic Materials and NET Power. In 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire Altus Intervention, a leading international provider of well intervention services and downhole technology, which will enhance OFSE's existing portfolio. The Altus transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023. We also

reached an agreement with GE for the sale of our Nexus Controls business. GE will continue to provide Baker Hughes with GE’s MarkTM controls products currently in the Nexus Controls portfolio, and we will be the exclusive supplier and service provider of such GE products for our oil and gas customers’ control needs. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2023.
The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the sanctions imposed in response to this crisis have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty. As we announced in March 2022, we suspended any new investments for our Russia operations. Over the course of 2022, changes to sanctions continued to make ongoing operations increasingly complex and significantly more challenging. As a result, we took actions to suspend substantially all of our operational activities related to Russia across the Company including suspending work on equipment and service contracts in Russia, and we completed the sale of part of our OFSE Russia business to local management in the fourth quarter of 2022. Russia represented approximately 2%, 5%, and 5% of our total revenue in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
As we look ahead to 2023, the global economy is expected to experience some challenges under the weight of inflationary pressures and tightening monetary conditions. Despite recessionary pressures in some of the world’s largest economies, we maintain a positive outlook for the energy sector. With years of under investment now being amplified by recent geopolitical factors, global spare capacity for oil and gas has deteriorated and will likely require years of investment growth to meet forecasted future demand. For this reason, we continue to believe that we are in the early stages of a multi-year upturn in global activity and are poised to see a second consecutive year of strong growth in global upstream spending in 2023.
We remain positive on the near term and long term prospects for the natural gas and LNG investment cycle. Near term, we believe that the likely reopening of China, combined with Europe’s need to refill gas storage supplies, will play a critical role in keeping global gas and LNG markets tight. Longer term, we remain optimistic on the structural growth outlook for natural gas and LNG as the world looks to lower emissions and displace the consumption of coal. In addition to the strong growth in traditional oil and gas spending, we also believe that the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. and potential new legislation in Europe will support significant growth opportunities in new energy in 2023 and beyond.
OUTLOOK
Our business is exposed to a number of macro factors, which influence our outlook and expectations given the current volatile conditions in the industry. All of our outlook expectations are purely based on the market as we see it today, and are subject to changing conditions in the industry.
•OFSE North America activity: We expect North American spending to continue to improve in 2023, as compared to 2022, should commodity prices remain at current levels.
•OFSE International activity: We expect spending outside of North America to experience strong growth in 2023, as compared to 2022, should commodity prices remain at current levels.
•IET LNG projects: We remain optimistic on the LNG market long-term and view natural gas as a transition and destination fuel. We continue to view the long-term economics of the LNG industry as positive.
We have other businesses in our portfolio that are more correlated with various industrial metrics, including global GDP growth. We also have businesses within our portfolio that are exposed to new energy solutions, specifically focused around reducing carbon emissions of energy and broader industry, including hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture, utilization and storage, and energy storage. We expect to see continued growth in these businesses as new energy solutions become a more prevalent part of the broader energy mix.
Overall, we believe our portfolio is well positioned to compete across the energy value chain and deliver comprehensive solutions for our customers. We remain optimistic about the long-term economics of the oil and gas industry, but we are continuing to operate with flexibility. Over time, we believe the world’s demand for energy will continue to rise, and that hydrocarbons will play a major role in meeting the world's energy needs for the foreseeable future. As such, we remain focused on delivering innovative, low-emission, and cost-effective solutions that deliver step changes in operating and economic performance for our customers.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity position as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company.
Our revenue is predominately generated from the sale of products and services to major, national, and independent oil and natural gas companies worldwide, and is dependent on spending by our customers for oil and natural gas exploration, field development and production. This spending is driven by a number of factors, including our customers' forecasts of future energy demand and supply, their access to resources to develop and produce oil and natural gas, their ability to fund their capital programs, the impact of new government regulations and most importantly, their expectations for oil and natural gas prices as a key driver of their cash flows.
Oil and Natural Gas Prices
Oil and natural gas prices are summarized in the table below as averages of the daily closing prices during each of the periods indicated.

-------------------------------- ----- ------ ----- - ----- - -----
 2022 2021 2020
Brent oil prices ($/Bbl) (1) $ 100.93 $ 70.86 $ 41.96
WTI oil prices ($/Bbl) (2) 94.90 68.14 39.16
Natural gas prices ($/mmBtu) (3) 6.45 3.89 2.03

(1)Energy Information Administration ("EIA") Europe Brent Spot Price per Barrel
(2)EIA Cushing, OK WTI ("West Texas Intermediate") spot price
(3)EIA Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price per million British Thermal Unit
Oil and natural gas prices increased during 2022 largely driven by supply constraints which has also been amplified as a result of recent geopolitical events.
Outside North America, customer spending is most heavily influenced by Brent oil prices. The average Brent oil prices increased to $100.93/Bbl in 2022 from $70.86/Bbl in 2021 and ranged from a low of $76.02/Bbl in December 2022, to a high of $133.18/Bbl in March 2022. The average Brent oil prices increased to $70.86/Bbl in 2021 from $41.96/Bbl in 2020 and ranged from a low of $50.37/Bbl in January 2021, to a high of $85.76/Bbl in October 2021.
In North America, customer spending is highly driven by WTI oil prices, which similarly to Brent oil prices, on average increased to $94.90/Bbl in 2022 from $68.14/Bbl in 2021, and ranged from a low of $71.05/Bbl in December 2022, to a high of $123.64/Bbl in March 2022. WTI oil prices on average increased to $68.14/Bbl in 2021 from $39.16/Bbl in 2020, and ranged from a low of $47.47/Bbl in January 2021, to a high of $85.64/Bbl in October 2021.
In North America, natural gas prices, as measured by the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price, averaged $6.45/mmBtu in 2022, representing a 66% increase over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $9.85/mmBtu in August 2022, to a low of $3.46/mmBtu in November 2022. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, working natural gas in storage at the end of 2022 was 2,891 billion cubic feet ("Bcf"), which was 9.5%, or 304 Bcf, below the corresponding week in 2021. Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price averaged $3.89/mmBtu in 2021, representing a 92% increase over the prior year. Throughout the year, Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Prices ranged from a high of $23.86/mmBtu in February 2021, to a low of $2.43/mmBtu in April 2021. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, working natural gas in storage at the end of 2021 was 3,226 billion cubic feet ("Bcf"), which was 6.8%, or 234 Bcf, below the corresponding week in 2020.

Baker Hughes Rig Count
The Baker Hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers. When drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry. Rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies, which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas. The counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity, however, these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity.
We have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944. We gather all relevant data through our field service personnel, who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs, customers, contractors and other outside sources as necessary. We base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction. This data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website. We believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable, however, it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information. Rig counts are compiled weekly for the U.S. and Canada and monthly for all international rigs. Published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations, such as onshore China because this information is not readily available.
Rigs in the U.S. and Canada are counted as active if, on the day the count is taken, the well being drilled has been started, but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits. In international areas, rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week. The weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly. The rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another, rigging up, being used in non-drilling activities including production testing, completion and workover, and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits.
The rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated.

------------- ----- ---- ----- -----
 2022 2021 2020
North America 898 610 522
International 851 756 827
Worldwide 1,749 1,366 1,349

2022 Compared to 2021
Overall the rig count was 1,749 in 2022, an increase of 28% as compared to 2021 due to an increase in activity in North America and internationally. The rig count in North America increased 47% and the international rig count increased 13% in 2022 compared to 2021.
Within North America, the increase was primarily driven by the U.S. rig count, which was up 51% on average when compared to the same period last year, and an increase in the Canada rig count, which was up 32% on average. Internationally, the increase in the rig count was driven by increases in the Latin America region, Africa region, Middle East region, and Asia-Pacific region of 22%, 19%, 16%, and 8%, respectively.
2021 Compared to 2020
Overall the rig count was 1,366 in 2021, an increase of 1% as compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in activity in North America partially offset by declines internationally. The rig count in North America increased 17% and the international rig count decreased 9% in 2021 compared to 2020.
Within North America, the increase was primarily driven by the Canadian rig count, which was up 48% on average when compared to the same period last year, and an increase in the U.S. rig count, which was up 10% on average. Internationally, the decrease in the rig count was driven primarily by decreases in the Middle East region, Africa region, and Europe region of 21%, 10%, and 10%, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The discussions below relating to significant line items from our consolidated statements of income (loss) are based on available information and represent our analysis of significant changes or events that impact the comparability of reported amounts. Where appropriate, we have identified specific events and changes that affect comparability or trends and, where reasonably practicable, have quantified the impact of such items. In addition, the discussions below for revenue and cost of revenue are on a total basis as the business drivers for product sales and services are similar. All dollar amounts in tabulations in this section are in millions of dollars, unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers.
Our results of operations are evaluated by the Chief Executive Officer on a consolidated basis as well as at the segment level. The performance of our operating segments is primarily evaluated based on segment operating income (loss), which is defined as income (loss) before income taxes and before the following: net interest expense, net other non-operating income (loss), corporate expenses, restructuring, impairment and other charges, goodwill and inventory impairments, separation related costs, and certain gains and losses not allocated to the operating segments.
In evaluating the segment performance, the Company uses the following:
Volume: Volume is the increase or decrease in products and/or services sold period-over-period excluding the impact of foreign exchange and price. The volume impact on profit is calculated by multiplying the prior period profit rate by the change in revenue volume between the current and prior period. It also includes price, defined as the change in sales price for a comparable product or service period-over-period and is calculated as the period-over-period change in sales prices of comparable products and services.
Foreign Exchange ("FX"): FX measures the translational foreign exchange impact, or the translation impact of the period-over-period change on sales and costs directly attributable to change in the foreign exchange rate compared to the U.S. dollar. FX impact is calculated by multiplying the functional currency amounts (revenue or profit) with the period-over-period FX rate variance, using the average exchange rate for the respective period.
(Inflation)/Deflation: (Inflation)/deflation is defined as the increase or decrease in direct and indirect costs of the same type for an equal amount of volume. It is calculated as the year-over-year change in cost (i.e. price paid) of direct material, compensation and benefits, and overhead costs.
Productivity: Productivity is measured by the remaining variance in profit, after adjusting for the period-over-period impact of volume and price, foreign exchange and (inflation)/deflation as defined above. Improved or lower period-over-period cost productivity is the result of cost efficiencies or inefficiencies, such as cost decreasing or increasing more than volume, or cost increasing or decreasing less than volume, or changes in sales mix among segments. This also includes the period-over-period variance of transactional foreign exchange, aside from those foreign currency devaluations that are reported separately for business evaluation purposes.
Orders and Remaining Performance Obligations
Our consolidated statements of income (loss) displays sales and costs of sales in accordance with SEC regulations under which “goods” is required to include all sales of tangible products and “services” must include all other sales, including other services activities. For the amounts shown below, we distinguish between “equipment” and “product services,” where product services refers to sales under product services agreements, including sales of both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs), which is an important part of our operations. We refer to “product services” simply as “services” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Orders: We recognized orders of $26.8 billion, $21.7 billion, and $20.7 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We recognized OFSE orders of $14.1 billion, $11.8 billion, and $12.3 billion and IET orders of $12.7 billion, $9.9 billion, and $8.4 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Within IET, Gas Technology Equipment orders were $6.4 billion, $3.9 billion, $3.0 billion, and Gas Technology Services orders were $3.0 billion, $2.9 billion, and $2.6 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Fiscal Year 2022 to Fiscal Year 2021
Revenue in 2022 was $21,156 million, an increase of $654 million, or 3%, from 2021. This increase in revenue was largely a result of increased activity in OFSE, partially offset by a decline in IET. OFSE increased $1,201 million and IET decreased $547 million.
Total segment operating income in 2022 was $2,336 million, an increase of $330 million, or 16%, from 2021. The increase was primarily driven by OFSE, which increased $371 million, partially offset by IET which decreased $42 million.
Oilfield Services & Equipment
OFSE 2022 revenue was $13,229 million, an increase of $1,201 million, or 10%, from 2021, primarily as a result of increased activity in North America and internationally, as evidenced by an increase in the global rig count. North America revenue was $3,764 million in 2022, an increase of $860 million from 2021. International revenue was $9,465 million in 2022, an increase of $341 million from 2021, primarily driven by growth in Latin America and the Middle East, partially offset by declines in the Russia Caspian and Europe regions. The year-over-year revenue was reduced by the removal of the subsea drilling systems ("SDS") business from the consolidated OFSE operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the formation of a joint venture.
OFSE 2022 segment operating income was $1,201 million, compared to $830 million in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume and price, partially offset by logistics and commodity cost inflation.
Industrial & Energy Technology
IET 2022 revenue was $7,926 million, a decrease of $547 million, or 6%, from 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in both Gas Technology Equipment and Gas Technology Services, the impact from foreign currency translation, and supply chain delays in Gas Technology Services, partially offset by higher volume in Industrial Technology.

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 35

IET 2022 segment operating income was $1,135 million, compared to $1,177 million in 2021. The decrease in profitability was driven by lower volume, unfavorable foreign currency translation impact, higher research and development costs, and inflationary pressure, partially offset by favorable business mix and higher pricing in certain product lines.
Corporate
In 2022, corporate expenses were $416 million, a decrease of $13 million compared to 2021, primarily driven by cost efficiencies and past restructuring actions.
Inventory Impairment
In 2022, we recorded inventory impairments of $31 million primarily in IET as part of suspending our Russia operations. Inventory impairments are reported in the "Cost of goods sold" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss). There were no inventory impairments during 2021.
Restructuring, Impairment and Other
In 2022, we recognized $682 million of restructuring, impairment and other charges, primarily related to the suspension of substantially all of our operations in Russia, as well as, costs incurred to facilitate our reorganization into two segments and the implementation of certain projects in our OFSE segment to optimize their global footprint. In addition, we impaired certain long-lived assets in our OFSE segment for the subsea production systems ("SPS") business due to a decrease in the estimated future cash flows driven by a decline in our long-term market outlook for this business. In 2021, we recognized $209 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges. The charges in 2021 primarily related to the initiatives in our OFSE segment that were the continuation of our overall strategy to right-size our structural costs.
Separation Related
We recorded $23 million of separation related costs in 2022, a decrease of $37 million from the prior year. Costs relate to the activities for the separation from GE, primarily related to information technology. Separation activities were substantially completed by the end of 2022.
Other Non-Operating Loss, Net
In 2022, we recorded $911 million of other non-operating loss, an increase of $328 million from the prior year, primarily due to the loss of $451 million from the sale of part of the OFSE business in Russia. We also recorded $265 million of unrealized losses related to marking our investments in C3 AI and ADNOC to fair value. Additionally, in December 2022, the Company, BHH LLC and GE entered into an agreement which resulted in the termination of the Tax Matters Agreement ("TMA"), and as a result, we recorded a charge of $81 million, of which $21 million was a cash payment to GE as a net settlement of claims asserted under the TMA. See "Note 11. Income Taxes" for further information.
Interest Expense, Net
In 2022, we incurred interest expense, net of interest income, of $252 million, a decrease of $47 million from the prior year, driven primarily by higher interest income, and lower interest expense due to $28 million of non-recurring costs in 2021 associated with the refinancing of our senior notes.
Income Taxes
In 2022, our provision for income taxes was $600 million. The difference between the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate is primarily related to losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances, restructuring charges for which a majority has no tax benefit, and earnings in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the U.S.

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 36

In 2021, our provision for income taxes was $758 million. The difference between the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% and the effective tax rate is primarily related to losses with no tax benefit due to valuation allowances and changes in unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions.
Fiscal Year 2021 to Fiscal Year 2020
Revenue in 2021 was $20,502 million, a decrease of $203 million, or 1%, from 2020. This decrease in revenue was largely a result of decreased activity in OFSE, partially offset by an increase in IET. OFSE decreased $956 million and IET increased $754 million.
Total segment operating income in 2021 was $2,006 million, an increase of $502 million, or 33%, from 2020. The increase was driven by OFSE, which increased $324 million, and IET, which increased $178 million.
Oilfield Services & Equipment
OFSE 2021 revenue was $12,028 million, a decrease of $956 million, or 7%, from 2020, primarily as a result of decreased international activity in 2021 compared to 2020, as evidenced by a decline in the corresponding rig count, and, to a lesser extent, decreased activity in North America, and supply chain constraints that occurred in the second half of 2021. International revenue was $9,124 million in 2021, a decrease of $753 million from 2020, primarily driven by declines in the Middle East, partially offset by growth in Latin America. North America revenue was $2,904 million in 2021, a decrease of $203 million from 2020. The decrease in revenue was also driven by the disposition of the surface pressure control flow business in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the removal of SDS from consolidated OFSE operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to the formation of a joint venture.
OFSE 2021 segment operating income was $830 million, compared to $506 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher cost productivity as a result of cost efficiencies and restructuring actions. Additional drivers were increases in price in certain product lines, partially offset by lower volume.
Industrial & Energy Technology
IET 2021 revenue was $8,473 million, an increase of $754 million, or 10%, from 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher volume for both Gas Technology Equipment and Gas Technology Services, partially offset by supply chain constraints that impacted product deliveries, mainly in the Industrial Technology product lines.
IET 2021 segment operating income was $1,177 million, compared to $998 million in 2020. The increase in profitability was driven primarily by higher volume, price, and productivity, partially offset by unfavorable business mix.
Corporate
In 2021, corporate expenses were $429 million, a decrease of $35 million compared to 2020, primarily driven by lower expenses as a result of cost out programs and restructuring actions.
Inventory Impairment
There were no inventory impairments during 2021. In 2020, we recorded inventory impairments of $246 million primarily related to our OFSE segment as a result of certain restructuring activities initiated by the Company. Charges for inventory impairments are reported in the "Cost of goods sold" caption of the consolidated statements of income (loss).
Goodwill Impairment
There were no goodwill impairments during 2021. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company’s market capitalization declined significantly driven by current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions including the decrease in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and collapse of oil prices driven by both surplus production and supply. Based on these events, we concluded that a triggering event occurred and we performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recognized a

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 37

goodwill impairment charge of $14,773 million during the first quarter of 2020. There were no other goodwill impairments during 2020.
Restructuring, Impairment and Other
In 2021, we recognized $209 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges. The charges in 2021 primarily relate to the initiatives in our OFSE segment that are the continuation of our overall strategy to right-size our structural costs. In 2020, we recognized $1,866 million in restructuring, impairment and other charges. These charges primarily related to the restructuring plan announced in the first quarter of 2020, which included product line rationalization actions, headcount reductions in certain geographical locations, and other initiatives to right-size operations for anticipated activity levels and market conditions.
Separation Related
We recorded $60 million of separation related costs in 2021, a decrease of $74 million from the prior year, largely driven by a reduction in the ongoing activities for the separation from GE, primarily related to information technology.
Other Non-Operating Income/(Loss), Net
In 2021, we recorded $583 million of other non-operating loss. Costs in 2021 include an unrealized loss of $1,085 million from marking our investment in C3 AI to fair value, partially offset by an unrealized gain of $241 million from marking our investment in ADNOC Drilling to fair value, by the reversal of $121 million of current accruals due to the settlement of certain legal matters, and by income of $121 million for liabilities previously expected to be recoverable as they were indemnified under the TMA with GE. This income from indemnified liabilities has an offset in the "Provision for income taxes" caption in our consolidated statements of income (loss).
In 2020, we recorded $1,040 million of other non-operating income. Included in this amount was an unrealized gain of $1,417 million related to marking our investment in C3 AI to fair value, partially offset by losses of $353 million for the sale of two product lines in OFSE, the rod lift systems business and the surface pressure control flow business.
Interest Expense, Net
In 2021, we incurred net interest expense of $299 million, an increase of $35 million from the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest expense, mainly related to $28 million of costs associated with the refinancing of our senior notes due December 2022, and lower interest income.
Income Taxes
In 2021, our income tax expense was $758 million, an increase of $199 million, from $559 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to tax expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and the geographical mix of earnings. Our 2021 income tax expense included $121 million that we previously expected to be recoverable as it related to liabilities indemnified under the TMA with GE. This tax expense has an offset in the "Other non-operating income (loss), net" caption in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

COMPLIANCE
In the conduct of all of our activities, we are committed to maintaining the core values of our Company, as well as high safety, ethical, and quality standards as also reported in our Quality Management System ("QMS"). We believe such a commitment is integral to running a sound, successful, and sustainable business. We devote significant resources to maintain a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program ("Compliance Program") which is designed to prevent, detect, and appropriately respond to any potential violations of the law, the Code of Conduct, and other Company policies and procedures.

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 38

Highlights of our Compliance Program include the following:
•Comprehensive internal policies over such areas as anti-bribery; travel, entertainment, gifts and charitable donations to government officials and other parties; payments to commercial sales representatives; and, the use of non-U.S. police or military organizations for security purposes.  In addition, there are policies and procedures to address customs requirements, visa processing risks, export and re-export controls, economic sanctions, anti-money laundering and anti-boycott laws.
•Global and independent structure of Chief Compliance Officer and other compliance professionals providing compliance advice, customized training and governance, as well as investigating allegations across all regions and countries where we do business.
•Comprehensive employee compliance training program that combines instructor-led and web-based training modules tailored to the key risks that employees face on an ongoing basis.
•Due diligence and monitoring procedures for third parties who conduct business on our behalf, including channel partners (sales representatives, distributors, resellers), and administrative service providers.
•Due diligence procedures for acquisition activities.
•Specifically tailored compliance risk assessments and audits focused on country and third party risk.
•Compliance Review Board comprised of senior officers of the Company that meets quarterly to monitor effectiveness of the Compliance Program, as well as segment compliance review boards that meet quarterly.
•Technology to monitor and report on compliance matters, including an internal investigations management system, a conflict of interest reporting and management system, a web-based anti-boycott reporting tool, global trade management systems and comprehensive watch list screening.
•Data privacy compliance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable data privacy requirements.
•A compliance program designed to create an “Open Reporting Environment” where employees are encouraged to report any ethics or compliance matter without fear of retaliation, including a global network of trained employee ombudspersons, and a worldwide, 24-hour business helpline operated by a third party and available in approximately 200 languages.
•Centralized finance organization with company-wide policies.
•Anti-corruption audits of high-risk countries, as well as risk-based compliance audits of third parties.
•We have region-specific processes and procedures for management of HR related issues, including pre-hire screening of employees; a process to screen existing employees prior to promotion into select roles where they may be exposed to finance and/or corruption-related risks; and implementation of a global new hire training module which includes compliance training for all employees.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our objective in financing our business is to maintain sufficient liquidity, adequate financial resources, and financial flexibility in order to fund the requirements of our business. We continue to maintain solid financial strength and liquidity. At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2021.
In the U.S. we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.6 billion and $1.6 billion and outside the U.S. of approximately $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. A substantial portion of the cash held outside the U.S. at December 31, 2022 has been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. If we decide at a later date to repatriate those funds to the U.S., we may incur other additional taxes that would not be significant to the total tax provision.

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 39

We have a $3 billion committed unsecured revolving credit facility ("the Credit Agreement") with commercial banks maturing in December 2024. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties, certain customary affirmative covenants and certain customary negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the Credit Agreement and other customary defaults. No such events of default have occurred. In addition, we have a commercial paper program with authorization up to $3 billion under which we may issue from time to time commercial paper with maturities of no more than 397 days. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the commercial paper program.
Certain Senior Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take certain actions. See "Note 9. Borrowings" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further details. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Our next debt maturity is December 2023.
We continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by geopolitical events, a global pandemic or a significant decline in oil and gas prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility; however, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends, repurchases of our common stock, and distributions to noncontrolling interests.
Cash Flows
Cash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:

-------------------- ------- ----- ------- - ----- - -----
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020
Operating activities $ 1,888 $ 2,374 $ 1,304
Investing activities (1,564) (463) (618)
Financing activities (1,592) (2,143) 225

Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities generated cash of $1,888 million, $2,374 million, and $1,304 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Our largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of goods and services.
In 2022, cash generated from operating activities were primarily driven by net losses adjusted for certain noncash items (including depreciation, amortization, loss on business dispositions, stock based compensation cost, loss on equity securities, and the impairment of certain assets). Working capital, which includes contract and other deferred assets, generated cash of $122 million in 2022 primarily due to strong progress collections on equipment contracts and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by the increase in receivables and inventory as we build for revenue growth.
In 2021, working capital generated $480 million of cash primarily due to accounts payable, inventories and contract and other deferred assets partially offset by accounts receivable and progress collections, as we continued to make progress on improving our working capital processes. Restructuring and GE separation related payments

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 40

were $175 million on a net basis in 2021 and included the proceeds from the disposal of certain facilities, which are reflected below in investing activities.
In 2020, working capital generated $216 million of cash primarily due to receivables and positive progress collections partially offset by accounts payable. Restructuring and GE separation related payments were $670 million in 2020.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities used cash of $1,564 million, $463 million, and $618 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $989 million, $856 million, and $974 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $217 million, $315 million, and $187 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets are primarily related to equipment that was lost-in-hole, predominantly in OFSE, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period.
In 2022, we paid $845 million for both acquisitions and investments in business interests. We completed several acquisitions during 2022 including BRUSH Power Generation, Quest Integrity, AccessESP, and Mosaic Materials. The total cash paid, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions was $767 million, and we used cash on hand to fund these transactions.
In 2021, we contributed our SDS business to create a joint venture and received as consideration 50% of the shares of the joint venture, cash of $70 million, and a promissory note of $80 million. In 2020, we received proceeds of $187 million primarily from the sale of our rod lift systems and our surface pressure control flow businesses.
In 2021, we invested $266 million to add capabilities to our new energy and industrial asset management offerings through the acquisition of business interests in Augury, Ekona Power, Electrochaea, and the acquisition of ARMS Reliability, among others. Also in 2021, we sold approximately 2.2 million C3 AI Shares and received proceeds of $145 million, which is included in other investing activities.
Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities used cash of $1,592 million, $2,143 million, and generated cash of $225 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
We had net repayments of short-term debt of $28 million, $41 million, and $204 million and long-term debt of nil, $1,313 million, and $42 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The repayment of long-term debt in 2021 was primarily driven by the early repayment of our 2.773% Senior Notes due December 2022 ("the 2022 Notes") with a principal amount of $1,250 million. In addition, a charge of $28 million related to the early redemption was recorded within "Interest expense, net" in our consolidated statements of income (loss).
In 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend by one cent to $0.19 per share during the fourth quarter. We paid dividends of $726 million, $592 million, and $488 million to our Class A stockholders, and we made distributions of $17 million, $157 million, and $256 million to GE in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
In 2022, our Board of Directors authorized an increase to our repurchase program of $2 billion of additional Class A common stock and LLC units for each of the Company and BHH LLC, respectively, increasing its existing repurchase authorization of $2 billion to $4 billion. During 2022, the Company and BHH LLC repurchased and canceled 29.7 million shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units, respectively, for a total of $828 million.
In 2021, we received proceeds from the issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 1.231% Senior Notes due December 2023 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.061% Senior Notes due December

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 41

2026. In 2020, we had proceeds from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.486% Senior Notes due May 2030.
In 2021, we repaid $832 million (£600 million) of commercial paper originally issued in 2020 ($737 million at date of issuance) under the COVID Corporate Financing Facility established by the Bank of England.
During 2021, the Company and BHH LLC repurchased and canceled 17.6 million shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units, respectively, for a total of $434 million.
Cash Requirements
We believe cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities, the available revolving credit facility, access to both our commercial paper program or our uncommitted lines of credit, and availability under our existing shelf registrations of debt will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity in the short-term and long-term to manage our working capital needs, meet contractual obligations, fund capital expenditures and dividends, repay debt, repurchase our common stock, and support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. When necessary, we issue commercial paper or other short-term debt to fund cash needs in the U.S. in excess of the cash generated in the U.S.
Our capital expenditures can be adjusted and managed by us to match market demand and activity levels. Based on current market conditions, capital expenditures in 2023 will be made at a rate that we estimate would equal up to 5% of annual revenue. The expenditures are expected to be used primarily for normal, recurring items necessary to support our business. We also anticipate making income tax payments in the range of $500 million to $550 million in 2023.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Our material cash commitments from known contractual and other obligations consist primarily of obligations for long-term debt and related interest, leases for property and equipment, and purchase obligations as part of normal operations. Certain amounts included in our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 are based on our estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors.
See “Note 9. Borrowings” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our long-term debt. See “Note 8. Leases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for information regarding scheduled maturities of our operating leases.
As of December 31, 2022, we had expected cash payments for estimated interest on our long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $267 million payable within the next twelve months and $2,936 million payable thereafter.
As of December 31, 2022, we had purchase obligations of $1,584 million payable within the next twelve months and $907 million payable thereafter. Our purchase obligations include expenditures for capital assets for 2023 as well as agreements to purchase goods or services or licenses that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.
Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with our uncertain tax positions, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, to the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $665 million in uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, have been excluded from the contractual obligations discussed above. See "Note 11. Income Taxes" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein for further information.

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 42

Other factors affecting liquidity
Customer receivables: In line with industry practice, we may bill our customers for services provided in arrears dependent upon contractual terms. In a challenging economic environment, we may experience delays in the payment of our invoices due to customers' lower cash flow from operations or their more limited access to credit markets. While historically there have not been material non-payment events, we attempt to mitigate this risk through working with our customers to restructure their debts. A customer's failure or delay in payment could have a material adverse effect on our short-term liquidity and results from operations. As of December 31, 2022, 15% of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the U.S. and 11% were from customers in Mexico. As of December 31, 2021, 13% of our gross customer receivables were from customers in the U.S and 12% were from customers in Mexico.
International operations: Our cash that is held outside the U.S. is 77% of the total cash balance as of December 31, 2022. We may not be able to use this cash quickly and efficiently due to exchange or cash controls that could make it challenging. As a result, our cash balance may not represent our ability to quickly and efficiently use this cash.
Supply chain finance programs: Under supply chain finance programs, administered by a third party, our suppliers are given the opportunity to sell receivables from us to participating financial institutions at their sole discretion at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers. Our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. These liabilities continue to be presented as accounts payable in our consolidated statements of financial position and reflected as cash flow from operating activities when settled. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing programs would have a material impact on our liquidity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to a material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our consolidated financial statements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions and their potential effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in future impairments of goodwill, or the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increased tax liabilities, among other effects. Also, see "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment, but they are not deemed critical as defined above.
Revenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements
We have long-term service agreements with our customers within our IET segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of greater than 10 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an over time basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 43

To develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.
To develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
We routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods.
Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $20 million, $14 million and $17 million for the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs.
Revenue Recognition on Sale of Customized Equipment
We recognize revenue on agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications including long-term construction projects, on an over time basis utilizing cost inputs as the measurement criteria in assessing the progress toward completion. Our estimation of the total costs required to fulfill our promise to a customer is generally based on our history of manufacturing similar assets for customers. This estimation of cost is critical to our revenue recognition process and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or cost of the inputs. In certain projects, the underlying technology or promise to the customer is unique to what we have historically promised and reliably estimating the total cost to fulfill the promise to the customer requires a significant level of judgment. We provide for potential losses on any of these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.  The total revenue recognized for the sale of equipment on an over time basis during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $4.2 billion, $4.8 billion, and $4.6 billion, respectively.
Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets
We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information, such as trading multiples, and comparable transactions. Cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors, such as management’s projections of future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital, and long-term growth rates. Market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from those assumed in our analysis. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our forecasts, business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments, potentially decreasing the fair value of one or more reporting units. Any resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 44

Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and differences between tax laws and U.S. GAAP in various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our rate may be further impacted by the repatriation of foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested to the extent the repatriation would result in additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Our tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $496 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2022. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers' ability to pay amounts due to us. We monitor our customers' payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured. We also consider the overall business climate in which our customers operate. For accounts receivable, a loss allowance matrix is utilized to measure lifetime expected credit losses. The matrix contemplates historical credit losses by age of receivables, adjusted for any forward-looking information and management expectations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for credit losses totaled $341 million and $400 million of total gross accounts receivable, respectively. We believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the anticipated credit losses under current conditions; however, uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers, either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing of any additional credit losses that may be required.
Inventory Reserves
Inventory is a significant component of current assets and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory. To determine these reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements, and technological developments. These estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential future outcomes. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, inventory reserves totaled $396 million and $374 million of gross inventory, respectively. We believe that our reserves are adequate to properly value potential excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory under current conditions. Significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess, slow moving or obsolete inventory that may be required.

NOTE 18. LEASES We lease certain facilities and data centers under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2032. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material variable payment provisions or material restrictive covenants. Operating lease expense was $121 million for fiscal 2022 and $119 million for both fiscal 2021 and 2020. We recognized operating lease expense in cost of revenue and operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our operating lease expense includes variable lease costs and is net of sublease income, both of which are not material.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

[" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for further details. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. Our next debt maturity is December 2023.
We continuously review our liquidity and capital resources. If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by geopolitical events, a global pandemic or a significant decline in oil and gas prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings. There are no ratings triggers that would accelerate the maturity of any borrowings under our committed credit facility; however, a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowings under the credit facility and could also limit or preclude our ability to issue commercial paper. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including borrowing under the credit facility.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we dispersed cash to fund a variety of activities including certain working capital needs, capital expenditures, the payment of dividends, repurchases of our common stock, and distributions to noncontrolling interests.
Cash Flows
Cash flows provided by (used in) each type of activity were as follows for the years ended December 31:

-------------------- ------- ----- ------- - ----- - -----
(In millions) 2022 2021 2020
Operating activities $ 1,888 $ 2,374 $ 1,304
Investing activities (1,564) (463) (618)
Financing activities (1,592) (2,143) 225

Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities generated cash of $1,888 million, $2,374 million, and $1,304 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Our largest source of operating cash is payments from customers, of which the largest component is collecting cash related to our sales of products and services including advance payments or progress collections for work to be performed. The primary use of operating cash is to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities and others for a wide range of goods and services.
In 2022, cash generated from operating activities were primarily driven by net losses adjusted for certain noncash items (including depreciation, amortization, loss on business dispositions, stock based compensation cost, loss on equity securities, and the impairment of certain assets). Working capital, which includes contract and other deferred assets, generated cash of $122 million in 2022 primarily due to strong progress collections on equipment contracts and an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by the increase in receivables and inventory as we build for revenue growth.
In 2021, working capital generated $480 million of cash primarily due to accounts payable, inventories and contract and other deferred assets partially offset by accounts receivable and progress collections, as we continued to make progress on improving our working capital processes. Restructuring and GE separation related payments

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 40

were $175 million on a net basis in 2021 and included the proceeds from the disposal of certain facilities, which are reflected below in investing activities.
In 2020, working capital generated $216 million of cash primarily due to receivables and positive progress collections partially offset by accounts payable. Restructuring and GE separation related payments were $670 million in 2020.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities used cash of $1,564 million, $463 million, and $618 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
Our principal recurring investing activity is the funding of capital expenditures to ensure that we have the appropriate levels and types of machinery and equipment in place to generate revenue from operations. Expenditures for capital assets totaled $989 million, $856 million, and $974 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, partially offset by cash flows from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $217 million, $315 million, and $187 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Proceeds from the disposal of assets are primarily related to equipment that was lost-in-hole, predominantly in OFSE, and to property, machinery and equipment no longer used in operations that was sold throughout the period.
In 2022, we paid $845 million for both acquisitions and investments in business interests. We completed several acquisitions during 2022 including BRUSH Power Generation, Quest Integrity, AccessESP, and Mosaic Materials. The total cash paid, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions was $767 million, and we used cash on hand to fund these transactions.
In 2021, we contributed our SDS business to create a joint venture and received as consideration 50% of the shares of the joint venture, cash of $70 million, and a promissory note of $80 million. In 2020, we received proceeds of $187 million primarily from the sale of our rod lift systems and our surface pressure control flow businesses.
In 2021, we invested $266 million to add capabilities to our new energy and industrial asset management offerings through the acquisition of business interests in Augury, Ekona Power, Electrochaea, and the acquisition of ARMS Reliability, among others. Also in 2021, we sold approximately 2.2 million C3 AI Shares and received proceeds of $145 million, which is included in other investing activities.
Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities used cash of $1,592 million, $2,143 million, and generated cash of $225 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
We had net repayments of short-term debt of $28 million, $41 million, and $204 million and long-term debt of nil, $1,313 million, and $42 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The repayment of long-term debt in 2021 was primarily driven by the early repayment of our 2.773% Senior Notes due December 2022 ("]:

[" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 herein, which discusses our most significant accounting policies.
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has reviewed our critical accounting estimates and the disclosure presented below. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates, and we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. There are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation and judgment, but they are not deemed critical as defined above.
Revenue Recognition on Long-Term Product Services Agreements
We have long-term service agreements with our customers within our IET segment. These agreements typically require us to maintain assets sold to the customer over a defined contract term. These agreements have average contract terms of greater than 10 years. From time to time, these contract terms may be extended through contract modifications or amendments, which may result in revisions to future billing and cost estimates. Revenue recognition on long-term product services agreements requires estimates of both customer payments and the costs to perform required maintenance services over the contract term. We recognize revenue on an over time basis using input method to measure our progress toward completion at the estimated margin rate of the contract.

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 43

To develop our billings estimates, we consider the number of billable events that will occur based on estimated utilization of the asset under contract, over the life of the contract term. This estimated utilization will consider both historical and market conditions, asset retirements and new product introductions, if applicable.
To develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of maintenance and overhaul events, including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services. In developing our cost estimates, we utilize a combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvements. Cost improvements are only included in future cost estimates after savings have been observed in actual results or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process.
We routinely review the estimates used in our product services agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes. These revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. We gain insight into expected future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the equipment installed and the close interaction with our customers through supplying critical services and parts over extended periods.
Revisions to cost or billing estimates may affect a product services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings; such adjustments generated earnings of $20 million, $14 million and $17 million for the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We provide for probable losses when they become evident. Cash billings collected on these contracts were approximately $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 18% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of future costs.
Revenue Recognition on Sale of Customized Equipment
We recognize revenue on agreements for sales of equipment manufactured to unique customer specifications including long-term construction projects, on an over time basis utilizing cost inputs as the measurement criteria in assessing the progress toward completion. Our estimation of the total costs required to fulfill our promise to a customer is generally based on our history of manufacturing similar assets for customers. This estimation of cost is critical to our revenue recognition process and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or cost of the inputs. In certain projects, the underlying technology or promise to the customer is unique to what we have historically promised and reliably estimating the total cost to fulfill the promise to the customer requires a significant level of judgment. We provide for potential losses on any of these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.  The total revenue recognized for the sale of equipment on an over time basis during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $4.2 billion, $4.8 billion, and $4.6 billion, respectively.
Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets
We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill on a qualitative or quantitative basis for each of our reporting units as of July 1, or more frequently when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level. When performing the annual impairment test we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine the existence of events and circumstances that would lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If such a conclusion is reached, we would then be required to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill. A quantitative assessment for the determination of impairment is made by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit with its fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information, such as trading multiples, and comparable transactions. Cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors, such as management’s projections of future cash flows, weighted-average cost of capital, and long-term growth rates. Market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time the valuation is performed. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain, and actual results may differ from those assumed in our analysis. The determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in these assumptions, and changes in our forecasts, business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments, potentially decreasing the fair value of one or more reporting units. Any resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations.

Baker Hughes Company 2022 Form 10-K | 44

Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and differences between tax laws and U.S. GAAP in various jurisdictions. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Our rate may be further impacted by the repatriation of foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested to the extent the repatriation would result in additional taxes such as withholding and income taxes. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. In cases where repatriation would otherwise incur significant withholding or income taxes, these foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and any other basis differences is not practicable.
Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to provide insight. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Our tax filings routinely are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or through the courts. We have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these proceedings, but settlements of issues raised in these audits may affect our tax rate. We have $496 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, at December 31, 2022. We are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts ultimately will be settled.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The estimation of anticipated credit losses that may be incurred as we work through the invoice collection process with our customers requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding our customers']:
