This section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

Market Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022

The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company’s operating results. In Ag Services and Oilseeds, strong global demand continued due to a short crop in South America. The conflict in Ukraine resulted in even tighter global stocks of commodities and created high volatility, which had a positive impact on North and South American origination prices. Global Trade results were driven by market disconnects, tight supply, strong destination marketing margins, and firm ocean freight rates. North American origination was negatively impacted by weather-related supply disruption and delayed planting and lower river levels. Crushing margins continued to benefit from strong protein and renewable diesel demand and tight oilseeds stocks. In Refined Products and Other, margins were driven by strong oil demand and tight supply with volatile energy markets driving up biodiesel margins. In Carbohydrate Solutions, demand for starches and sweeteners was solid with margins remaining steady despite higher input costs. Ethanol demand for domestic gasoline was lower, in part due to high gas prices, while export demand remained strong, driven by favorable blending economics and government incentives. Corn milling margins benefited from strong co-product results, as prices for oil and feed products rose in line with higher underlying corn prices. Corn costs were volatile and higher, in part due to a relatively low projected corn stocks-to-use ratio and uncertainty caused by the conflict in Ukraine. Nutrition benefited from overall strong demand in various food, beverage, and dietary supplement categories. In Human Nutrition, demand for flavors, flavor systems, specialty proteins, bioactives, and fibers was strong, but higher energy, transportation, and raw material costs, and a strong U.S. dollar adversely impacted results. In Animal Nutrition, amino acids pricing and margins improved due to a tighter global supply environment but the devaluation of certain currencies, a bird flu outbreak, and weak demand in other product lines, with some premix and additives customers cutting products out of formulation due to increased ingredient, freight, and energy costs, adversely impacted results. Increased competition in Brazil also contributed to the weak demand in that country. ADM’s productivity initiatives are improving the Company’s capabilities to help mitigate the impact of inflation.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased 60% or $1.6 billion, to $4.3 billion. Segment operating profit increased 41% or $1.9 billion, to $6.5 billion, and included a net charge of $100 million consisting of charges totaling $147 million related to the impairment of certain assets, restructuring, and contingencies/settlements, partially offset by gains on the sale of certain assets of $47 million. Included in segment operating profit in the prior year was a net charge of $136 million consisting of charges totaling $213 million related to the impairment of certain assets, restructuring, and settlement, partially offset by gains on the sale of ethanol and certain other assets of $77 million. Adjusted segment operating profit (a non-GAAP measure) increased $1.9 billion to $6.6 billion due primarily to higher results in most businesses except in Vantage Corn Processors. Corporate results in the current year were a net charge of $1.3 billion and included a mark-to-market gain of $9 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. Corporate results in the prior year were a net charge of $1.3 billion and included a pension settlement charge of $83 million, loss on debt extinguishment of $36 million, a mark-to-market gain of $19 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020, acquisition-related expenses of $7 million, and a restructuring charge of $4 million.

Income taxes of $868 million increased $290 million. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2022 was 16.6% compared to 17.4% for 2021. The change in the rate was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings and the impact of discrete tax items.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions. The overall decrease in oilseeds processed volumes was primarily related to decreased crush rates resulting from the decline in seeds availability, a temporarily idled facility in Paraguay due to crop failure, weather-related challenges, and the indefinite shutdown of a Ukraine facility since February 2022. The overall decrease in corn processed volumes was primarily related to reduced volumes of fuel alcohol due to market conditions, the sale of the Peoria, Illinois facility in November 2021, and logistical challenges surrounding railcar availability since the second quarter of 2022.

Revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

------------------------------ ------ ------- ---- ------ ------ ------ ------ - ------
(In millions) 2022 2021 Change

Revenues and cost of products sold in agricultural merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes. In periods of significant changes in market prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Ag Services and Oilseeds, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.

Revenues increased $16.3 billion to $101.6 billion due to higher sales prices ($17.1 billion), partially offset by lower sales volumes ($0.8 billion). Higher sales prices of corn, wheat, oil, soybean, and meal, and higher sales volumes of rice, flavors, biodiesel, and corn, were partially offset by lower sales prices of rice and flavors, and lower sales volumes of wheat and oil. Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues increased 19% to $79.6 billion due to higher sales prices ($14.3 billion), partially offset by lower sales volumes ($1.8 billion). Carbohydrate Solutions revenues increased 26% to $14.0 billion due to higher sales prices ($2.6 billion) and higher sales volumes ($0.3 billion), despite the loss of USD-grade industrial alcohol volumes from the divested Peoria, Illinois facility. Nutrition revenues increased 14% to $7.6 billion due to higher sales prices ($0.2 billion) and higher sales volumes ($0.7 billion).

Cost of products sold increased $14.7 billion to $94.0 billion due principally to higher average commodity costs and higher manufacturing expenses. Manufacturing expenses increased $0.9 billion to $7.0 billion due principally to higher energy costs, higher maintenance expenses, increased operating supplies, and higher salaries and benefit costs.

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Foreign currency translation impacts decreased revenues by $2.6 billion and cost of products sold by $2.4 billion.

Gross profit increased $1.6 billion or 26%, to $7.6 billion due to higher results in Ag Services and Oilseeds ($1.3 billion), Starches and Sweeteners ($477 million), and Nutrition ($149 million), partially offset by lower results in Vantage Corn Processors ($352 million). These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 35.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12% to $3.4 billion due principally to provisions for bad debt, higher IT and project-related expenses, higher salaries and benefit costs, increased travel expenses, and amortization of intangibles from new acquisitions.

Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs decreased $98 million to $66 million. Charges in the current year consisted of $37 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets and $28 million of restructuring charges, presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $1 million of restructuring charges in Corporate. Charges in the prior year consisted primarily of $125 million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets and $35 million of restructuring charges, presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $4 million of restructuring charges in Corporate.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $237 million to $832 million due to higher earnings from the Company’s investments in Wilmar and Olenex.

Loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year of $36 million was related to the early redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due in March 2025.

Interest and investment income increased $197 million to $293 million due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by lower revaluation gains of $37 million compared to $49 million in the prior period.

Interest expense increased $131 million to $396 million due to higher long-term debt balances and increased short-term rates on the Company’s U.S. and European commercial paper borrowing programs. Interest expense in the current year also included a $9 million mark-to-market gain adjustment related to the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020 compared to a $19 million mark-to-market gain adjustment in the prior year.

Other income - net of $358 million increased $264 million. Current year income included a legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Company’s Reserve, Louisiana, export facility of $110 million, net foreign exchange gains of $105 million, a $50 million one-time payment from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program, gains on disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $25 million, partially offset by other net expense. Prior year income included gains on the sale of ethanol and certain other assets and disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, net foreign exchange gains of $24 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $33 million, and other income, partially offset by a non-cash pension settlement charge of $83 million related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain salaried and hourly retirees and terminated vested participants under the Company’s ADM Retirement Plant and ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees.

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Ag Services and Oilseeds operating profit increased 58%. Ag Services results were significantly higher versus the prior year. Global trade results were higher, driven by strong performances in destination marketing and global ocean freight. North American origination volumes were lower but margins were higher year-over-year. South America results were higher, driven by better origination margins on good demand for grain. Crushing was higher year-over-year driven by robust protein and renewable diesel demand. Positive net timing effects in the current year versus negative timing effects in the prior year helped drive higher year-over-year results. Refined Products and Other results were higher than the prior year, driven by higher margins due to strong oils demand. Biodiesel margins also benefited from direct sales compared to the historical auction sales. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher versus the prior year.

Carbohydrate Solutions operating profit increased 6%. Starches and Sweeteners, including ethanol production from the wet mills, delivered higher results versus the prior year, driven by solid margins across sweeteners and starches, strong contributions from corn co-products, and effective risk management, partially offset by weaker ethanol margins. Sales volumes for starches and sweeteners continued their recovery and the biosolutions platform continued to deliver revenue growth as demand for plant-based products expanded into more diverse applications. Vantage Corn Processors results were lower versus the prior year as ethanol margins decreased from the 2021 strong positioning gains and industrial alcohol results from the now-sold Peoria, Illinois facility, partially offset by the $50 million one-time payment from the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery Program.

Nutrition operating profit increased 7%. Human Nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results. Flavors results were lower driven by demand fulfillment challenges, the impact of the strong U.S. dollar in EMEA, softer demand in Asia Pacific, and higher costs in North America. Strong sales growth in alternative proteins, including contribution from the Sojaprotein acquisition, and good demand for texturants offset some higher operating costs to help deliver better year-over-year results in Specialty Ingredients. Health and Wellness was also higher year-over-year, powered by probiotics, including the contribution from the November 2021 Deerland Probiotics and Enzymes acquisition, and robust demand for fiber and Vitamin E. Animal Nutrition profits were higher than the prior year due primarily to strength in amino acids.

Other Business operating profit increased 568%. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services and improved underwriting performance resulted in better captive insurance results.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Corporate results were a net charge of $1.3 billion in the current year compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Interest expense-net increased $56 million due primarily to higher long-term debt balances and increased average rates on the Company’s U.S. and European commercial paper borrowing programs. Unallocated corporate costs increased $69 million due primarily to higher IT and project-related costs and higher costs in the Company’s centers of excellence, partially offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. Loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year related to the early redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due in March 2025. Gain on debt conversion option was related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020. Impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges in the prior year included a non-cash pension settlement charge of $83 million related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain salaried and hourly retirees and terminated vested participants under the Company’s ADM Retirement Plan and ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees to independent third parties, and individually insignificant restructuring charges. Other income in the current year included investment revaluation gains of $37 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $25 million, and foreign exchange gains from hedge activity, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million. Other income in the prior year included investment revaluation gains of $49 million, the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $16 million, and foreign exchange gains from hedge activity, partially offset by railroad maintenance expenses of $67 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance. These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items. The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes. Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted, where applicable, for specified items.

Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company’s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. Adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS, earnings before income taxes, and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.  The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of ADM’s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures. The primary source of funds to finance ADM’s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility and accounts receivable securitization programs.  In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets.

Cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2022 compared to $6.6 billion in 2021. Working capital changes as described below decreased cash by $1.5 billion in the current year compared to an increase of $2.7 billion in the prior year. Segregated investments increased approximately $1.5 billion due to increased trading activity in the Company’s futures commission and brokerage business. Trade receivables increased $1.7 billion primarily due to higher revenues. Inventories increased $0.3 billion due to higher inventory prices, partially offset by lower inventory volumes. Trade payables increased $1.4 billion due to increased payables related to inventory purchases and higher costs and expenses from increased operating activity during the fourth quarter of the current year compared to the same period last year. Payables to brokerage customers increased $0.9 billion due to increased customer trading activity in the Company’s futures commission and brokerage business.

Cash used in investing activities was $1.4 billion this year compared to $2.7 billion last year. Capital expenditures in the current year were $1.3 billion compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Net assets of businesses acquired in the prior year of $1.6 billion were related to the acquisitions of P4, Sojaprotein, and Deerland. Proceeds from sales of assets and businesses of $0.1 billion in the current year related to the sale of certain assets compared to $0.2 billion in the prior year related to the sale of the ethanol production complex in Peoria, Illinois and certain other assets.

Cash used in financing activities was $2.5 billion this year compared to $1.1 billion last year. Long-term debt borrowings in the current year of $0.8 billion consisted of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.900% Notes due 2032. Long-term debt borrowings in the prior year of $1.3 billion consisted of the $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.700% Notes due 2051 issued on September 10, 2021 and the €0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2022 issued in a private placement on March 25, 2021. The Company expects to apply an amount equal to the proceeds from the borrowings in the current year to finance or refinance eligible green projects and/or eligible social projects. Proceeds from the borrowings in the prior year were used to redeem debt and for general corporate purposes. Long-term debt payments in the current year of $0.5 billion consisted of the €0.5 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate senior notes due 2022 issued in a private placement on March 25, 2021. Long-term debt payments in the prior year of $0.5 billion consisted of the early redemption of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due 2025 in September 2021. Net payments on short-term credit arrangements were $0.4 billion in the current year compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. Share repurchases in the current year were $1.5 billion compared to an insignificant amount in the prior year. Dividends paid in the current year were $0.9 billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year.

At December 31, 2022, ADM had $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.5 to 1.  Included in working capital is $9.0 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.  At December 31, 2022, the Company’s capital resources included shareholders’ equity of $24.3 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling $12.4 billion, of which $9.3 billion was unused.  ADM’s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders’ equity) was 24% and 26% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company uses this ratio as a measure of ADM’s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.  The Company’s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders’ equity) was 25% and 28% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $5.0 billion supported the commercial paper borrowing programs, against which there was $0.3 billion of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on the Company’s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $5.7 billion, the Company has asserted that these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.

38

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers. The Programs provide the Company with up to $2.6 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expand the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 19 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs). As of December 31, 2022, the Company utilized $2.6 billion of its facility under the Programs.

On November 5, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019. On August 7, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the extension of the stock repurchase program through December 31, 2024 and the repurchase of up to an additional 100,000,000 shares under the extended program. The Company has acquired approximately 112.2 million shares under this program and its extension as of December 31, 2022.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has total available liquidity of $10.3 billion comprised of cash and cash equivalents and unused lines of credit.

In 2023, the Company expects capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and additional cash outlays of approximately $1.0 billion in dividends and up to $1.0 billion in opportunistic share repurchases, subject to other strategic uses of capital and the evolution of operating cash flows and the working capital position throughout the year.

The Company’s purchase obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $15.8 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively. The change is primarily related to a decrease in obligations to purchase agricultural commodity inventories and other commitments. As of December 31, 2022, the Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations of $14.8 billion within the next twelve months. The Company’s other material cash requirements within the next 12 months include commercial paper outstanding of $0.3 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of $0.9 billion, interest payments of $0.3 billion, operating lease payments of $0.3 billion, transition tax liability of $37 million, and pension and other postretirement plan contributions of $107 million. The Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations and other material cash requirements beyond the next twelve months of $16.8 billion.

The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.  The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2022.

The three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company’s credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.  These estimates and judgments are based on the Company’s historical experience and management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.  Certain of the Company’s accounting policies and estimates are considered critical, as these policies and estimates are important to the depiction of the Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.  Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on ADM’s financial condition and results of operations. Management has discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies and estimates.  Following are the accounting policies and estimates management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Fair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity Derivatives

Description: Certain of the Company’s inventory, inventory-related payables, and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 are valued at estimated fair values, including $9.0 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $1.3 billion of commodity derivative assets, $1.3 billion of commodity derivative liabilities, and $1.3 billion of inventory-related payables.  Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward purchase and sales contracts for agricultural commodities. Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.

Judgments and Uncertainties: Management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.  The Company’s inventory, inventory-related payables, and commodity derivative fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $3.3 billion of assets and $0.7 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.  For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 3, see Note 4 in Item 8.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.  If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported could differ materially.  Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods could differ materially.

Derivatives – Designated Hedging Activities

Description: The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase or sales price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month. See Note 5 in Item 8 for additional information.

Judgments and Uncertainties: Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of revenues and/or cost of products sold.

Income Taxes

Description: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law. Changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur.

Judgments and Uncertainties: ADM calculates its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company uses judgment in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its annual tax provision.

------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: While ADM considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. The Company recognizes a tax position in its consolidated financial statements when it is determined to be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For example, the Company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in Argentina and the Netherlands, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company. The Company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits (see Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information).

Business Combinations

Description: The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, Business Combinations, as amended. The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill. The Company accounts for any redeemable noncontrolling interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings.

Judgments and Uncertainties: Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and related allocations. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings.

Goodwill

Description: Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests.  The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.  The Company has seven reporting units with goodwill identified at one level below the operating segment using the criteria in ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).

Judgments and Uncertainties: The Company adopted the provisions of Topic 350, which permits, but does not require, a company to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting unit’s fair value. If after completing the qualitative assessment, a company believes it is likely that a reporting unit is impaired, a discounted cash flow analysis is prepared to estimate fair value. Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, revenue growth, and discount rates. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment in five reporting units and using a quantitative assessment in two reporting units.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change: The Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $5 million and $1 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (see Note 18 in Item 8 for more information). There was no goodwill impairment charge recorded for the year ended December 31, 2022. The estimated fair values of the reporting units evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment were substantially in excess of their carrying values. If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...
