ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company and generally discusses the results of operations for the current year compared to prior two years. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in connection with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Certain references to particular information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are made to assist readers.

OVERVIEW
Whirlpool significantly accelerated its portfolio transformation with the divestiture of its Russia business, the acquisition of InSinkErator and the conclusion of the EMEA strategic review which resulted in an agreement to contribute Whirlpool's European major domestic appliance business to a newly formed entity. Collectively, these actions are expected to deliver an enhanced financial profile as we transform our portfolio to a high-growth, high-margin business.
In a challenging macroeconomic cycle, including softening consumer sentiment and inflationary pressures, Whirlpool's full-year net sales declined 10%, including Whirlpool Russia net sales of $138 million in 2022 compared to $505 million of net sales in the prior year. Whirlpool saw GAAP net loss available to Whirlpool of $1,519 million (net loss margin of (7.7)%), or $(27.18) per share, compared to GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool of $1,783 (net earnings margin of 8.1%), or $28.36 per share in the same prior-year period. Additionally, Whirlpool delivered ongoing (non-GAAP) earnings per share of $19.64 and full-year ongoing EBIT margin of 6.9%, compared to $26.59 and 10.8% in the same prior-year period. On a GAAP basis, net loss margins were impacted by $1.9 billion due to primarily non-cash charges related to the divestiture of the Whirlpool Russia business and the conclusion of the strategic review of EMEA. On a GAAP and ongoing basis Whirlpool's results were impacted by lower volumes and cost inflation partially offset by favorable price/mix and lower GAAP and adjusted tax rates.
Cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in 2021, alongside free cash flow (non-GAAP) of $820 million in 2022, compared to $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily driven by lower earnings, partially offset by favorable working capital and hedge settlements in the current period.
In 2022, Whirlpool returned $1.3 billion in cash to shareholders, including a twenty-five percent increase in our quarterly dividend and over $900 million of share repurchases, in addition to the $1.4 billion returned to shareholders in 2021.
Please see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" elsewhere in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

nm: not meaningful
Consolidated net sales for 2022 decreased by 10.3% compared to 2021, primarily driven by lower volumes, divestiture of our Russia business and the impact of foreign currency, partially offset by the favorable impact of product/price mix. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales for 2022 decreased 8.1% compared to 2021. Consolidated net sales for 2021 increased 13.0% compared to 2020, primarily driven by the favorable impact of product price/mix. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, net sales for 2021 increased 12.3% compared to 2020.
The chart below summarizes the balance of net sales by operating segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2022 decreased to 15.6% compared to 20.1% in 2021, primarily driven by lower volume, cost inflation and inventory reduction actions, partially offset by favorable product price/mix. The consolidated gross margin percentage for 2021 increased to 20.1% compared to 19.7% in 2020, primarily driven by the favorable impact of product price/mix, partially offset by raw material inflation and increased marketing and technology investments.

Results of Operating Segments
Our operating segments are based upon geographical region and are defined as North America, EMEA, Latin America and Asia. These regions also represent our reportable segments. The chief operating decision maker, who is the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance based on each segment's earnings (loss) before interest and taxes (EBIT), which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry (income) expense and excluding restructuring costs, asset impairment charges and certain other items that management believes are not indicative of the region's ongoing performance, if any. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
On January 16, 2023, Whirlpool entered into a contribution agreement with Arçelik A.Ş (“Arcelik”) related to our European major domestic appliance business which is reported within our EMEA reportable segment. The European disposal group met the criteria for held for sale accounting during the fourth quarter of 2022. The operations of the disposal group did not meet the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2023 and the results of European major domestic appliance business will be included in our financials until closing of the transaction. For additional information, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Whirlpool will retain ownership of its EMEA KitchenAid small domestic appliance business.
The following is a discussion of results for each of our operating segments. Each of our operating segments has been impacted by COVID-19 in the areas of manufacturing operations such as a decrease in production levels resulting in production level below normal capacity. Excess capacity costs were not material for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. Additionally, operating segments have been impacted by disruptions in supply chains and distribution channels, among other macroeconomic impacts.

Selling, General and Administrative
The following table summarizes selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by operating segment:

------------------- ------------ ----- ------------------ ---- ---- ------------------ --- ---- ----- ------------------ --- --- - ----- --- -
 December 31,
Millions of dollars 2022 As a %of Net Sales 2021 As a %of Net Sales 2020 As a %of Net Sales
North America $ 837 7.3 % $ 860 6.9 % $ 733 6.5 %
EMEA 366 9.1 502 9.9 472 10.8
Latin America 272 8.7 261 8.3 233 9.0
Asia 124 11.3 151 12.2 218 17.2
Corporate/other 221 — 307 — 221 —
Consolidated $ 1,820 9.2 % $ 2,081 9.5 % $ 1,877 9.6 %

Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2022 decreased compared to 2021. The decrease is primarily driven by a reduction in employee compensation related costs, reductions in marketing spend, a gain from a sale-leaseback transaction, divestiture of businesses and benefits of prior restructuring actions. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2021 is comparable to 2020.

Restructuring
We incurred restructuring charges of $21 million, $38 million and $288 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the full year 2023, we expect to incur less than $50 million of restructuring charges, similar to the past two years.
See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles
In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded an impairment loss of $384 million related to goodwill ($278 million) and other intangibles ($106 million) related to the EMEA reporting unit, Indesit and Hotpoint* trademarks, respectively. The primary indicators of impairment were the adverse impacts from the continuation of the Russia and Ukraine conflict resulting in economic uncertainty in the EMEA region, the divestiture of our Russia operations and other macroeconomic factors.
No material impairment charges of goodwill or other intangibles were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020, respectively.

See Note 6 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.
(Gain) Loss on Sale and Disposal of Businesses
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we incurred a loss of $1,521 million related to the planned divestiture of our European major domestic appliance business. The loss includes a write-down of the net assets of $1,151 million of the disposal group to a fair value of $139 million and also includes $393 million of cumulative currency translation adjustments, $98 million release of other comprehensive loss on pension and $18 million of other transaction related costs. The net assets of the disposal group also include the EMEA trademarks, Hotpoint* and Indesit, which were impaired as part of the write-down.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
On June 27, 2022, our subsidiary Whirlpool EMEA SpA entered into a share purchase agreement with Arcelik to sell our Russian business to Arcelik for contingent consideration. On August 31, 2022, we completed the sale to Arcelik. We incurred a loss of $348 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 related to the sale of the Russia business.
On May 6, 2021, the partial tender offer for Whirlpool China was completed and, subsequent to the deconsolidation of the entity, we recorded a gain of $284 million in the third quarter of 2021.
On June 30 2021, we completed the sale of our Turkish subsidiary and incurred a loss of $164 million in the second quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, an additional loss of $13 million related to the final purchase price adjustments was recorded, increasing the total loss to $177 million.
See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Interest and Sundry (Income) Expense
Interest and sundry (income) expenses were $(19) million, $(159) million and $(21) million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Net interest and sundry income decreased $140 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a substantial liquidation of an offshore subsidiary, resulting in a total charge of $84 million for a release of other comprehensive income on hedging and cumulative translation adjustments. The remaining decrease is primarily due to a gain of $42 million on previously held equity interest of 49% in Elica PB India recorded in the prior year.
Net interest and sundry income increased $138 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due a gain of $42 million on previously held equity interest of 49% in Elica PB India in 2021 and the higher expense of pension settlements and other postretirement benefit plans in 2020.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $190 million, $175 million and $189 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest expense increased in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to increase in long-term debt driven by the InSinkErator acquisition. Interest expense decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to short-term debt reduction.
For additional information, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $265 million, $518 million and $382 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change in tax expense in 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily due to overall lower level of earnings, partially offset by the impact of recorded impairments on the sale and disposal of businesses and goodwill which are not deductible, and increases in valuation allowances.
The increase in tax expense in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to higher earnings and related tax expense, audits and settlements, partially offset by legal entity restructuring tax benefits.
See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE
Based on internal projections for the industry and broader economy, we currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for 2023 to be within the following ranges:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------- - ------
 2023
 Current Outlook
Estimated GAAP earnings per diluted share, for the year ending December 31 $16.00 — $18.00

Industry demand
North America (6)% — (4)%
EMEA (6)% — (4)%
Latin America (3)% — (1)%
Asia 2% — 4%

For the full-year 2023, we have incorporated our latest expectations of the following key trends in our guidance: subdued demand with gradual improvement throughout the year, strong net cost takeout actions delivering $500 million benefit, as well as raw material inflation tailwinds combined for $800-$900 million cost benefits. Our anticipated tax rate is between 14% and 16%. Additionally, we expect to generate cash from operating activities of approximately $1.4 billion and free cash flow of approximately $800 million, including restructuring cash outlays of approximately $25 million and, with respect to free cash flow, capital expenditures of approximately $600 million.
The table below reconciles projected 2023 cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named non-GAAP measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations. For 2023 we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.

-------------------------------------------------- ---------------
 2023
Millions of dollars Current Outlook
Cash provided by (used in) operating activities(1) ~$1,400
Capital expenditures ~(600)
Free cash flow ~$800

(1)Financial guidance on a GAAP basis for cash provided by (used in) financing activities and cash provided by (used in) investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection, the Company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control.
The projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the Board of Directors of Whirlpool, and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, some of which we refer to as "ongoing" measures, including:
•Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
•EBIT margin
•Ongoing EBIT
•Ongoing earnings per diluted share

39

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
•Ongoing EBIT margin
•Sales excluding foreign currency
•Free cash flow
•Gross debt leverage
Ongoing measures, including ongoing earnings per diluted share and ongoing EBIT, exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. EBIT margin is calculated by dividing EBIT by net sales. Sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales, in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's exchange rate compared to the prior-year period net sales. Management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that Gross Debt Leverage (Gross Debt/Ongoing EBITDA) provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess the Company's ability to pay off its incurred debt. We also disclose segment EBIT, which we define as operating profit less interest and sundry (income) expense and excluding restructuring costs, asset impairment charges and certain other items, if any, that management believes are not indicative of the region's ongoing performance, as the financial metric used by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting.
Management believes that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. The Company provides free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow related metrics, such as free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net sales, as long-term management goals, not an element of its annual financial guidance, and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for these long-term goal metrics. Any such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the Company's control. Whirlpool does not provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for its other forward looking long-term value creation and other goals, such as organic net sales, EBIT, and gross debt/Ongoing EBITDA, as such reconciliation would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company’s control.
We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool, net sales, net earnings (loss) as a percentage of net sales (net earnings margin), net earnings (loss) per diluted share and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Throughout 2021 and comparable periods, the Company defined adjusted free cash flow as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assets/businesses, and changes in restricted cash. Starting in 2022, the Company presents free cash flow which is cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow of $1,963 million and $1,246 million in 2021 and 2020 has been restated to $1,651 million and $1,091 million free cash flow measure, respectively, to conform with current year presentation.

Footnotes
(a) RESTRUCTURING COSTS - In 2022, and moving forward, we will only exclude restructuring actions greater than $50 million from our ongoing results. In 2021, these costs were primarily related to actions that right-size and reduce the fixed cost structure of our EMEA business and other centralized functions. In 2020, these costs were primarily related to actions that right-size and reduce the fixed cost structure of our global business, attributable primarily to the macroeconomic uncertainties caused by COVID-19. This includes costs of approximately $100 million related to restructuring in the United States and approximately $188 million related to restructuring outside of the United States, including the exit of our Naples, Italy facility.
(b) IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND OTHER ASSETS - During the second quarter of 2022, the carrying value of the EMEA reporting unit and Indesit and Hotpoint* trademarks exceeded their fair values resulting in an impairment charge of $384 million which is recorded within Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2022 we recognized an impairment charge of $12M related to equity method investment in Brazil which is recorded within Equity method investment income (loss), net of tax.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas.

In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on disposal of $1,521 million in the fourth-quarter of 2022. The loss includes a write-down of the net assets of $1,151 million of the disposal group to a fair value of $139 million and also includes $393 million of cumulative currency translation adjustments, $98 million release of other comprehensive loss on pension and $18 million of other transaction related costs. Whirlpool’s European major domestic appliance business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting during the fourth-quarter of 2022 and will be included in the Company’s results until closing of the transaction.
During the second quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Russia business. We classified this disposal group as held for sale and recorded an impairment loss of $346 million for the write-down of the assets to their fair value. During the third quarter of 2022, the loss from disposal was adjusted by an immaterial amount resulting in a final loss amount of $348 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.
Additionally, during the fourth-quarter 2022, we incurred unique transaction related costs of $25 million related to portfolio transformation for a total of $67 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. These transaction costs are recorded in Selling, General and Administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).
On May 17, 2021, our subsidiary entered into a share purchase agreement to sell its Turkish subsidiary to Arçelik. As part of the agreement, Arçelik assumed responsibility for operating the manufacturing site in Manisa, Turkey, following closing. The transaction closed on June 30, 2021. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $93 million and recognized a loss on sale of $164 million. During the third quarter of 2021, amounts for working capital and other customary post-closing adjustments were finalized and an additional $13 million loss related to the sale of business was recorded.
On March 31, 2021, Galanz launched its partial tender offer for majority ownership of Whirlpool China. Our subsidiary tendered approximately 31% of Whirlpool China's outstanding shares in the tender offer, with the remainder representing a noncontrolling interest of approximately 20% in Whirlpool China. The transaction closed on May 6, 2021. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $193 million and recognized a gain on sale of $284 million.
The net impact realized for gain on sale and disposal of Turkey and China businesses included in the income statement for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 is $105 million.
(d) SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDATION OF SUBSIDIARY - During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company liquidated an offshore subsidiary and recorded a one-time charge of $84 million for a release of the other comprehensive income on hedging and cumulative translation adjustments.
(e) (GAIN) LOSS ON PREVIOUSLY HELD EQUITY INTEREST - During the third quarter of 2021, Whirlpool Corporation acquired an additional 38% equity interest in Elica PB India Private Limited (Elica PB India) for $57 million, which resulted in a controlling equity ownership of approximately 87%. The previously held equity interest of 49% in Elica PB India was remeasured at fair value of $74 million on the acquisition date, which resulted in a gain of $42 million. This gain was recorded within Interest & sundry (income) expense during the third quarter. The earnings per diluted share impact is calculated net of minority interest.
(f) PRODUCT WARRANTY AND LIABILITY (INCOME) EXPENSE - During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company released an accrual of approximately $30 million related to an EMEA-produced washer recall campaign. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company further released an accrual of approximately $9 million. These adjustments were made based on our revised expectations regarding future period cash expenditures for the campaign.
(g) CORRECTIVE ACTION RECOVERY - The Company recorded a benefit of $13 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to a vendor recovery in our EMEA-produced washer corrective action.

(h) SALE-LEASEBACK, REAL ESTATE AND RECEIVABLE ADJUSTMENTS - In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company sold and leased back a group of properties for net proceeds of approximately $139 million. The transaction met the requirements for sale leaseback accounting. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded the sale of the properties, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $113 million.
(i) NORMALIZED TAX RATE ADJUSTMENT - During the full-year of 2021, the Company calculated ongoing earnings per share using an adjusted tax rate of 23.5%. During the full-year of 2022, the Company calculated ongoing earnings per share using an adjusted tax rate of 4.4%, which excludes the impacts of the non-tax deductible loss on sale of the Russia business of $348 million and impairment of goodwill of $278 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022, along with the impact of M&A transactions of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.
(j) NORMALIZED SHARE COUNT ADJUSTMENT - As a result of our current period GAAP earnings loss, the impact of antidilutive shares was excluded from the loss per share calculation on a GAAP basis. The share count adjustment used in the calculation of the full-year ongoing earnings per diluted share includes basic shares outstanding of 55.9 million plus the impact of antidilutive shares of 0.6 million which were excluded on a GAAP basis.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying the maturity structure, we avoid concentrations of debt, reducing liquidity risk. We have varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business. We regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities, which include funding innovation and growth through capital, research and development expenditures as well as opportunistic mergers and acquisitions; and providing returns to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and maintaining our strong investment grade rating.
The Company believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool's ability to fund its activities and obligations. Whirlpool has historically been able to leverage its strong free cash flow generation to fund our operations, pay for any debt servicing costs and allocate capital for reinvestment in our business, funding share repurchases and dividend payments.
Our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending, restructuring activities, and returns to shareholders. We also have $248 million of term debt maturing in the next twelve months, and are currently evaluating our options in connection with this maturing debt, which may include repayment through refinancing, free cash flow generation or cash on hand.
The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022, of which 64% was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and expected future foreign investments. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the cash to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (if any) and withholding taxes payable to various countries. It is not practical to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with the repatriation of cash due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation.
At December 31, 2022, we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Switzerland and India which represented 4.1%, 1.7%, 1.3%, 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively. In addition, we had third-party accounts receivable outside of the United States greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in Brazil, which represented 1.3%. We continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally.

Notes payable consists of short-term borrowings payable to banks and commercial paper, which are generally used to fund working capital requirements. At December 31, 2022, we had $4 million of notes payable outstanding. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
We monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending, depository, derivative counterparty banks and customers regularly, and take certain action to manage credit risk. We diversify our deposits and investments in short-term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty. We also continue to review customer conditions globally.
In the past, when faced with a potential volume reduction from any one particular segment of our trade distribution network, we generally have been able to offset such declines through increased sales throughout our broad distribution network.
For additional information on transfers and servicing of financial assets, accounts payable outsourcing and guarantees, see Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Share Repurchase Program
For additional information about our share repurchase program, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Sources and Uses of Cash
We met our cash needs during 2022 through cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and financing arrangements. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at December 31, 2022 decreased $1,086 million compared to the same period in 2021.
The following table summarizes the net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the periods presented. Significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during 2022 are discussed below:

Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ (1,086) $ 110 $ 982

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities in 2022 decreased compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced cash earnings partially offset by the favorable cash impact of improved working capital and hedge settlements in the current period.
Cash provided by operating activities in 2021 increased compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by strong cash earnings partially offset by working capital initiatives. The improvement in working capital was driven by increased accounts payable due to raw material inflation, partially offset by increased inventory due to higher input costs and a modest inventory build.
The timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels, sales patterns, promotional programs, funding requirements, credit management, as well as receivable and payment terms. Depending on the timing of cash flows, the

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
location of cash balances, as well as the liquidity requirements of each country, external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2022 primarily reflects the $3 billion cash outflow for the purchase of InSinkErator business.
The increase in cash provided by investing activities during 2021 primarily reflects the cash impacts from the divestiture of Whirlpool China (approximately $341 million) and our Turkey manufacturing subsidiary (approximately $52 million) as well as an increase in capital expenditures (approximately $115 million).
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
The increase in cash provided by financing activities during 2022 primarily reflects the proceeds ($2.5 billion) from borrowings of long-term debt related to InSinkErator acquisition.
The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2021 primarily reflects lower debt issuance proceeds (approximately $733 million) along with higher share repurchases (approximately $920 million) partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt (increase of approximately $273 million) net effect of reduced short-term debt (increase of approximately $330 million).
Dividends paid in financing activities were $390 million, $338 million, and $311 million during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Financing Arrangements
The Company had total committed credit facilities of approximately $6.2 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The facilities are geographically diverse and reflect the Company's global operations. The Company believes these facilities are sufficient to support its global operations. We had $2.5 billion drawn on the committed credit facilities at December 31, 2022 which were used to fund the InSinkErator acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2022. We had no borrowings outstanding under the committed credit facilities at December 31, 2021.
See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Other material obligations include off-balance sheet arrangements arising in the normal course of business. They primarily consist of agreements we enter into with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds. These agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in Brazil, as is customary under local regulations, and other governmental obligations and debt agreements. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately $401 million and $294 million outstanding under these agreements, respectively.
Additionally, we have material contractual obligations. They primarily consist of long-term debt obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, taxes, United States and foreign pension plans and other postretirement benefits. See Notes 1, 3, 7-10 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Dividends
In February 2022, our Board of Directors approved a 25.0% increase in our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.75 per share from $1.40 per share representing the 10th consecutive year of increased dividends.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, forecasted events, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee's expected period of employment. The determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions. Those key assumptions include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds and stock, and medical cost inflation. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense.
Our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at December 31, 2022 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for 2023 were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes the sensitivity of our December 31, 2022 retirement obligations and 2023 retirement benefit costs of our United States plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results:

------------------------------------------------ ---------------- -------------------------------- -------------------
 Estimated increase (decrease) in
Millions of dollars PercentageChange 2023 Expense PBO/APBO(1)for 2022

(1)Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for other postretirement benefit plans.
These sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years' financial results. Furthermore, the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results. For additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes
We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, general business credits and deductible temporary differences, will be realizable in future years. Realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and, where possible, considers projections of future profitability. If recovery is not more likely than not, we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, for the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. If future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had total deferred tax assets of $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $412 million and $195 million, respectively. The Company has established tax planning strategies and transfer pricing policies to provide sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. Our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years. The tax expense has been influenced primarily by foreign tax credits, audit settlements and adjustments, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income. Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including business profitability, tax planning strategies, and enacted tax laws.
We have various tax filings with applicable jurisdictions to defend our positions with regards to the timing and amount of deductions and credits as well as the allocation of income across various jurisdictions. We regularly inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken to ensure the timely recording of liabilities for tax positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We believe that our estimates and judgements with respect to uncertain tax positions are reasonable and accurate at the time they are developed. However, actual results may differ due to unforeseen future events and circumstances. If one or more of the applicable taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefits we have recorded, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in outcomes that are unfavorable to the Company. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 1, Note 8 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Warranty Obligations
The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized. The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold. Warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, warranty expense as a percentage of consolidated net sales approximated 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. For additional information about warranty obligations, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles
Certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets which are not amortized. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had goodwill of approximately $3.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. The increase in goodwill in 2022 was driven by the InSinkErator acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by full impairment of EMEA goodwill in the second quarter of 2022. We have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately $3.0 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The trademark assets increase in 2022 was driven by the InSinkErator acquisition, partially offset by EMEA trademarks that were partially impaired in the second quarter of 2022 and subsequently classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2022.
The InSinkErator acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. On the acquisition date, we recognized the separately identifiable intangible assets based on the preliminary purchase price allocation. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values assigned to the net identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business was recognized as goodwill. For additional information, see Notes 11 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is below the carrying amount. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment.
In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible, including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible; actual and projected revenue and EBIT margin; relevant market data for both the Company and its peer companies; industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the Company's competitive position. Significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value.
For our annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2022, the Company performed a qualitative impairment assessment for goodwill and elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment to evaluate certain brand trademarks. The Company elected to perform a qualitative assessment on the other indefinite-lived intangible assets noting no events that indicated that the fair value was less than the carrying value that would require a quantitative impairment assessment.
Goodwill Valuations
In 2022, we evaluated goodwill using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, a goodwill impairment test is performed to identify potential impairment. The goodwill impairment test compares a reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, then a goodwill impairment loss is measured at the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Otherwise, we conclude that no impairment is indicated and and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no impairment loss is measured.
In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit, including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative tests performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit; actual and projected operating results; relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies;

49

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the Company's competitive position. Significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Valuations
In performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill, primarily trademarks, we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark; and a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment loss.
The estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of intangible assets involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management's estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions. In performing the quantitative assessment on these assets, significant assumptions used in our relief-from-royalty model included revenue growth rates, assumed royalty rates and the discount rate, which are discussed further below.
Revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our financial planning and analysis process and vary from brand to brand. Adverse changes in the operating environment or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a material impairment charge.
In determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we considered factors that affect the assumed royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid by a market participant for the use of trademarks. The most significant factors in determining the assumed royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry, the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks, and the position of the trademarked products in the given product category.
In developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks, we used a market participant discount rate based on a weighted-average cost of capital, adjusted for higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries, as applicable, as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets.
If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, a material impairment charge of our trademarks could occur, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Maytag trademark
Our Maytag trademark is at risk at December 31, 2022. The fair value of the Maytag trademark exceeded its carrying value of $1,021 million by approximately 6%. We expect future fiscal year revenues for this brand to improve as we recover from temporary volume loss and continue to execute our brand leadership strategy and benefit from our new product investments.
A 10% reduction of forecasted Maytag revenues would result in an impairment charge of approximately $49 million.
We determined a royalty rate of 4% for the Maytag trademark, noting that a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $75 million.
We determined a discount rate of 10.25% for Maytag, noting that a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $9 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
JennAir trademark
Our JennAir trademark is at risk at December 31, 2022. The fair value of the JennAir trademark exceeded its carrying value of $304 million by approximately 8%.
A 10% reduction of forecasted JennAir revenues would result in an impairment charge of approximately $9 million.
We determined a royalty rate of 6% for JennAir, noting that a 50 basis point reduction of the royalty rate would result in an impairment charge of approximately $3 million.
We determined a discount rate of 11.25% for JennAir, noting that a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value of the trademark to breakeven with its carrying value.
Other indefinite-lived intangible assets
Based on our quantitative impairment assessment as of May 31, 2022, the carrying values of the Hotpoint* and Indesit trademarks exceeded their fair values by $36 million and $70 million, respectively, and we recorded intangible impairment charges for these amounts during the second quarter of 2022. The remaining carrying values of the Hotpoint* and Indesit trademarks were included in the European major domestic appliance disposal group which was classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2022.
The fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by an amount sufficient to not be deemed "at risk". There were no other impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2022 or 2021.
For additional information about goodwill and indefinite-life intangible valuations, see Note 6 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

OTHER MATTERS
For additional information regarding certain of our loss contingencies/litigation, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unfavorable outcomes in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period.
Antidumping and Safeguard Petition
As previously reported, Whirlpool filed petitions in 2011 and 2015 alleging that Samsung, LG and Electrolux violated U.S. and international trade laws by dumping large residential washers into the U.S. Those petitions resulted in orders imposing antidumping duties on certain large residential washers imported from South Korea, Mexico, and China, and countervailing duties on certain large residential washers from South Korea. In March 2019, the order covering certain large residential washers from Mexico was extended for an additional five years, while the order covering certain large residential washers from South Korea was revoked. In August 2022, the order covering certain large residential washers from China was extended for an additional five years. The order is subject to administrative reviews, possible appeals, and other potential modifications.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
Whirlpool also filed a safeguard petition in May 2017 to address our concerns that Samsung and LG were evading U.S. trade laws by moving production from countries covered by antidumping orders. A safeguard remedy went into effect in February 2018, implementing tariffs on finished large residential washers and certain covered parts for three years. The remedy expired in accordance with its terms and as scheduled in February 2023.
Raw Materials and Global Economy
The current domestic and international political environment have contributed to uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. We have experienced raw material inflation in certain prior years based on the impact of U.S. tariffs and other global macroeconomic factors. Due to many factors beyond our control, including the conflict in Ukraine and related sanctions, COVID-related shutdowns and government actions in China, we expect to continue to be impacted by the following factors: a global shortage of certain components, such as semiconductors, a strain on raw material and input cost inflation, all of which began easing towards the end of 2022, but are expected to continue throughout the first half of 2023. This could require us to modify our current business practices, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements in any particular reporting period. In addition, we are pursuing a business interruption insurance claim related to the 2021 Texas freeze, amounts related to which could be a material gain in a future period.

These forward-looking statements should be considered with the understanding that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially.
This document contains forward-looking statements about Whirlpool Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Whirlpool") that speak only as of this date. Whirlpool disclaims any obligation to update these statements. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding future financial results, long-term value creation goals, restructuring expectations, productivity, raw material prices and related costs, supply chain, transaction-related closing and synergies expectations, asset impairment, litigation, ESG efforts, and the impact of COVID-19 and the Russia/Ukraine conflict on our operations. Many risks, contingencies and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from Whirlpool's forward-looking statements. Among these factors are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers, and the impact of the changing retail environment, including direct-to-consumer sales; (2) Whirlpool's ability to maintain or increase sales to significant trade customers; (3) Whirlpool's ability to maintain its reputation and brand image; (4) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business objectives and leverage its global operating platform, and accelerate the rate of innovation; (5) Whirlpool’s ability to understand consumer preferences and successfully develop new products; (6) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (7) acquisition, divestiture, and investment-related risks, including risks associated with our past acquisitions; (8) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (9) COVID-19 pandemic-related business disruptions and economic uncertainty; (10) Whirlpool's ability to navigate risks associated with our presence in emerging markets; (11) risks related to our international operations, including changes in foreign regulations; (12) Whirlpool's ability to respond to unanticipated social, political and/or economic events; (13) information technology system failures, data security breaches, data privacy compliance, network disruptions, and cybersecurity attacks; (14) product liability and product recall costs; (15) our ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees; (16) the impact of labor relations; (17) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel, resins, base metals) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (18) Whirlpool's ability to manage foreign currency fluctuations; (19) impacts from goodwill impairment and related charges; (20) triggering events or circumstances impacting the carrying value of our long-lived assets; (21) inventory and other asset risk; (22) health care cost trends, regulatory changes and variations between results and estimates that could increase future funding obligations for pension and postretirement benefit plans; (23) litigation, tax, and legal compliance risk and costs, especially if materially different from the amount we expect to incur or have accrued for, and any disruptions caused by the same; (24) the effects and costs of governmental investigations or related actions by third parties; (25) changes in the legal and regulatory environment including environmental, health and safety regulations, data privacy, and taxes and tariffs; (26) Whirlpool's ability to respond to the impact of climate change and climate change regulation; and (27) the uncertain global economy and changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, and investors are advised to review disclosures in our filings with the SEC. It is not possible to foresee or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. Therefore, investors should not consider the foregoing factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties, or factors that could potentially cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements.
Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 2, 2022, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services: ------------- -------------------- ----- (in millions) Fiscal Year Purchase Obligations 2023 $ 1,632 2024 921 2025 775 2026 753 2027 783 Thereafter 1,226 Total $ 6,090 Royalties We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...

(7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies.

Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State.

['S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company and generally discusses the results of operations for the current year compared to prior two years. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in connection with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Certain references to particular information in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are made to assist readers.

INCOME TAXES Income before income taxes for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following: -------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - ----- (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Domestic $ 1,958 $ 1,736 $ 1,090 Foreign 4,050 3,969 3,086 Income before income taxes $ 6,008 $ 5,705 $ 4,176 The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following: ----------------------------------------- ---- ----- ---- ----- ---- --- ------- - ------- (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Current: United States federal $ 465 $ 391 $ 119 Foreign 329 197 222 State and local 132 103 79 Total current 926 691 420 Deferred: United States federal (45) (148) (123) Foreign 360 359 (1,313) State and local 11 (19) (68) Total deferred 326 192 (1,504) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 1,252 $ 883 $ (1,084) Intra-Entity Transfers of Certain Intellectual Property Rights ("IP rights") During fiscal 2020, we completed intra-entity transfers of certain IP rights to our Irish subsidiary in order to better align the ownership of these rights with how our business operates. The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.

Corporate/other 221 — 307 — 221 —
Consolidated $ 1,820 9.2 % $ 2,081 9.5 % $ 1,877 9.6 %

Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2022 decreased compared to 2021. The decrease is primarily driven by a reduction in employee compensation related costs, reductions in marketing spend, a gain from a sale-leaseback transaction, divestiture of businesses and benefits of prior restructuring actions. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of consolidated net sales in 2021 is comparable to 2020.

Restructuring
We incurred restructuring charges of $21 million, $38 million and $288 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the full year 2023, we expect to incur less than $50 million of restructuring charges, similar to the past two years.
See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangibles
In the second quarter of 2022, we recorded an impairment loss of $384 million related to goodwill ($278 million) and other intangibles ($106 million) related to the EMEA reporting unit, Indesit and Hotpoint* trademarks, respectively. The primary indicators of impairment were the adverse impacts from the continuation of the Russia and Ukraine conflict resulting in economic uncertainty in the EMEA region, the divestiture of our Russia operations and other macroeconomic factors.
No material impairment charges of goodwill or other intangibles were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)
Income Taxes
We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, general business credits and deductible temporary differences, will be realizable in future years. Realization of our net operating loss and general business credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and, where possible, considers projections of future profitability. If recovery is not more likely than not, we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, for the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. If future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made.
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had total deferred tax assets of $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $412 million and $195 million, respectively. The Company has established tax planning strategies and transfer pricing policies to provide sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets. Our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years. The tax expense has been influenced primarily by foreign tax credits, audit settlements and adjustments, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income. Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including business profitability, tax planning strategies, and enacted tax laws.
We have various tax filings with applicable jurisdictions to defend our positions with regards to the timing and amount of deductions and credits as well as the allocation of income across various jurisdictions. We regularly inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken to ensure the timely recording of liabilities for tax positions that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We believe that our estimates and judgements with respect to uncertain tax positions are reasonable and accurate at the time they are developed. However, actual results may differ due to unforeseen future events and circumstances. If one or more of the applicable taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefits we have recorded, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.
In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in outcomes that are unfavorable to the Company. For additional information about income taxes, see Note 1, Note 8 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Warranty Obligations
The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized. The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold. Warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, warranty expense as a percentage of consolidated net sales approximated 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. For additional information about warranty obligations, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 9. Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements mostly for certain of our offices, data centers, colocations, and land. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements mostly for certain network infrastructure. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2023 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles
Certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets which are not amortized. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had goodwill of approximately $3.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. The increase in goodwill in 2022 was driven by the InSinkErator acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by full impairment of EMEA goodwill in the second quarter of 2022. We have trademark assets with a carrying value of approximately $3.0 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The trademark assets increase in 2022 was driven by the InSinkErator acquisition, partially offset by EMEA trademarks that were partially impaired in the second quarter of 2022 and subsequently classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2022.
The InSinkErator acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. On the acquisition date, we recognized the separately identifiable intangible assets based on the preliminary purchase price allocation. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values assigned to the net identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business was recognized as goodwill. For additional information, see Notes 11 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We consider qualitative factors to assess if it is more likely than not that the fair value for goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets is below the carrying amount. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative assessment.
In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible, including, but not limited to: the results of prior quantitative assessments performed; changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible; actual and projected revenue and EBIT margin; relevant market data for both the Company and its peer companies; industry outlooks; macroeconomic conditions; liquidity; changes in key personnel; and the Company']:
