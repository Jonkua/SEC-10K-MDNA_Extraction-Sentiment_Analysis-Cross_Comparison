Item 7.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes presented in this report. Within the tables presented throughout this discussion, certain columns may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. References to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years, which end on September 30.
Company Overview
Description of the Company and Business Segments
Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. The Company's organizational structure is based upon three principal business segments, BD Medical (“Medical”), BD Life Sciences (“Life Sciences”) and BD Interventional (“Interventional”).
BD’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. Our products are marketed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. We organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include the following geographic regions: Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and certain countries within Greater Asia. We are primarily focused on certain countries whose healthcare systems are expanding.
Strategic Objectives
BD remains focused on delivering durable growth, creating shareholder value and making appropriate investments for the future. BD 2025, our vehicle for value creation, is anchored in three key pillars: grow, simplify and empower. BD's management team aligns our operating model and investments with these key strategic pillars through continuous focus on the following underlying objectives:
Grow
•Developing and maintaining a strong portfolio of leading products and solutions that address significant unmet clinical needs, improve outcomes, and reduce costs;
•Focusing on our core products, services and solutions that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers;
•Investing in research and development that leads to and expands category leadership, as well as results in a robust product pipeline;
•Accelerating innovation in smart devices, robotics, analytics, and artificial intelligence in order to enable new care settings, streamline care workflows and remove administrative burdens for healthcare providers;
•Leveraging our global scale in order to provide equitable access to affordable medical technologies around the world, including in under-resourced markets;
•Supplementing our internal growth through strategic acquisitions in faster growing market segments; and
•Focusing on cash management and an efficient capital structure in order to drive balance sheet productivity and strong shareholder returns.

Simplify
•Driving operating effectiveness and margin expansion by increasing factory productivity and asset efficiencies;
•Reducing complexity, increasing agility and improving customer experience by rationalizing our product portfolio, as well as by simplifying and optimizing our architecture and operating model;
•Making strategic investments which prioritize a culture of quality and our quality management system to ensure we are a best-in-class, proactive quality-driven organization;
•Enhancing customer experiences through the digitalization of internal processes and go-to-market approaches;
•Working across our supply chain to responsibly source materials and goods, as well as to reduce environmental impacts; and
•Creating more resilient operations through investments in an enterprise-wide renewable energy strategy.
Empower
•Fostering a purpose-driven culture with a focus on positive impact to all stakeholders–customers, patients, employees, shareholders and communities;
•Cultivating an inclusive work environment that welcomes and celebrates diverse backgrounds and perspectives;
•Growing and enabling talent through training, development and reskilling strategies; and
•Driving sustainability initiatives within our organizational units to support enterprise-wide collaboration towards our sustainability strategy.
In assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as BD’s financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews forecast data, monthly actual results, including segment sales, and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows.
BD’s Spin-Off of Diabetes Care and Sale of Surgical Instrumentation Platform
On April 1, 2022, we completed the spin-off of our former Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company. The historical results of the Diabetes Care business that was contributed in the spin-off were reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2023, we completed the sale of the Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform. The historical financial results for this platform have not been classified as a discontinued operation. Additional disclosures regarding the spin-off and sale are provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Key Trends Affecting Results of Operations
Our operations, supply chain, suppliers and customers are exposed to various global macroeconomic factors. The factors which were most impactful to our fiscal year 2023 results included the following:
•Inflation continued to drive higher costs of raw materials, electronic components, labor, energy, and logistical services. We expect inflation to persist into our fiscal year 2024, but at levels lower than our fiscal year 2023.
•A limited supply of skilled labor in certain markets drove higher overall labor costs, as noted above, and we expect labor availability will continue to be a macroeconomic challenge for our operations.
•The availability of energy sources in certain markets, as well as the availability of certain raw materials and electronic components on a global basis.

27

Table of Contents
•Logistics capacity constraints eased in our fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022 and lead times improved in most key routes. However, adequate supply of transportation capacity is critical to our operations and constrained capacity may unfavorably impact our results of operations.
Current healthcare delivery has transitioned more care from acute to non-acute settings and has increased focus on chronic disease management; this transition has placed additional financial pressure on hospitals and the broader healthcare system. Healthcare institutions may take actions to mitigate any persistent pressures on their budgets and such actions could impact the future demand for our products and services. Additionally, a worsening of staffing shortages within healthcare systems may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products.
Certain geopolitical conditions, including the evolving situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, may contribute to the macroeconomic conditions discussed above. While these geopolitical conditions have not materially impacted our results of operations to date, the continuation and/or an escalation of these evolving situations may further weaken the global economy and could result in additional inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints, including the unavailability and cost of energy.
 Additionally, governments in China and other countries use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders as well as price regulation. During our fiscal year 2023, regional and national volume-based procurement programs (“VoBP”) established by the government in China unfavorably impacted our revenues and we anticipate that these programs may continue to impact our results of operations.
We continue to invest in research and development, strategic tuck-in acquisitions, geographic expansion, and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including geographical expansion), develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness.
We have been mitigating the impacts of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above through various strategies which leverage our procurement, logistics and manufacturing capabilities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively mitigate these pressures in future periods and an inability to offset these pressures through our strategies, at least in part, could adversely impact our results of operations. Due to the significant uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above, our future operating performance, particularly in the short-term, may be subject to volatility. The impacts of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are dependent on certain factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Summary of Financial Results
Worldwide revenues in 2023 of $19.372 billion increased 2.7% from the prior-year period. This increase reflected the following impacts:

----------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- -
 Increase (decrease) in current-period revenues
Volume/other 3.0 %
Period-over-period decline in revenues related to COVID-19-only testing (2.3) %
Pricing 3.8 %
Foreign currency translation (1.8) %

Increase in revenues from the prior-year period 2.7 %

Our fiscal year 2023 revenues reflected sales in our Life Sciences segment related to COVID-19-only diagnostic testing on the BD VeritorTM Plus and BD MaxTM Systems of $73 million, compared with revenues from such testing products in 2022 of $511 million.

Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from continuing operating activities totaling $2.990 billion in 2023. At September 30, 2023, we had $1.489 billion in cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash. We continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends. During fiscal year 2023, we paid cash dividends of $1.114 billion, including $1.046 billion paid to common shareholders and $68 million paid to preferred shareholders.
Each reporting period, we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period. A stronger U.S. dollar, compared to the prior-year period, resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues and earnings during our fiscal year 2023. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Foreign currency-neutral ("FXN") information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a foreign currency-neutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). Results on a foreign currency-neutral basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The impact of other specified items on gross margin in 2023 compared with 2022, and also in 2022 compared with 2021, reflected charges of $653 million, $72 million and $56 million, in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the estimate of probable future product remediation costs, as further discussed above. The impacts of other specified items on the comparisons of gross margin above additionally reflected a non-cash asset impairment charge of $54 million recorded in the Medical segment in 2022.
Operating performance in 2023 and 2022 reflected the following:
•Favorable impacts attributable to our ongoing continuous improvement projects and pricing.
•The unfavorable impacts of higher raw material, labor and freight costs.
•Operating performance in 2022 additionally reflected the optimization of our product mix and the recovery of pre-pandemic demand for products with higher margins as well as a favorable comparison to 2021, which included approximately $93 million of excess and obsolete inventory expenses related to COVID-19-only testing inventory which were recognized by the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit.

Selling and administrative
Lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily reflected higher revenues in 2023 and favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher selling costs in 2023, as well as an increase in our deferred compensation plan liability due to market performance. The investment gains on deferred compensation plan assets were recorded to Other expense, net.
Higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily reflected higher shipping and selling costs in 2022, partially offset by a decrease in our deferred compensation plan liability due to market performance and favorable foreign currency translation.
Research and development
Lower research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily reflected revenue growth that outpaced the timing of project spending. Research and development expense as a percentage of revenues was flat in 2022 compared with 2021, which primarily reflected the timing of project spending. Spending in 2023, 2022 and 2021 reflected our continued commitment to invest in new products and platforms.
Acquisitions and other restructurings
Restructuring expense in 2023, 2022 and 2021 primarily included restructuring costs related to simplification and other cost saving initiatives. Integration expense in 2023 and 2022 included system integration costs and integration expense in 2021 included costs incurred due to our acquisition of C.R. Bard, Inc. in fiscal year 2018. For further disclosures regarding the costs relating to restructurings, refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Other operating (income) expense, net
Other operating (income) expense in 2023, 2022 and 2021 included the following items which are further discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data:

Financial Instrument Market Risk
We selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk, primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations. The counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Foreign Exchange Risk
BD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts. We have also hedged the currency exposure associated with investments in certain foreign subsidiaries with instruments such as foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps, which are designated as net investment hedges, as well as currency exchange contracts. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period. We did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against these foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2023 or 2022.

Table of Contents
Derivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities.
With respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2023 and 2022, the impact that changes in the U.S. dollar would have on pre-tax earnings was estimated as follows:

------------------------------- ------------------- ----- ---- - ----
 Increase (decrease)
(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022
10% appreciation in U.S. dollar $ (100) $ (63)
10% depreciation in U.S. dollar $ 100 $ 63

These calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments.

Interest Rate Risk
When managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities.
The impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2023 and 2022, as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period, based upon our overall interest rate exposure, were estimated as follows:

------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------- --- --------------------------------------------- ---- --- ---- - --- - ---
 Increase (decrease) to fair value of interest rate derivatives outstanding Increase (decrease) to earnings or cash flows
(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2023 2022
10% increase in interest rates $ (3) $ (4) $ 2 $ (1)
10% decrease in interest rates $ 2 $ 4 $ (2) $ 1

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our strong financial position and cash flow performance have provided us with the capacity to accelerate our innovation pipeline through investments in research and development, as well as through strategic acquisitions. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, our ability to generate operating cash flow, and if needed, our access to borrowings from our financing facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our foreseeable operating needs. The following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2023, 2022 and 2021:

----------------------------------------------------- ---- ------- ---- ---- ------- - -------
(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022 2021
Net cash provided by (used for) continuing operations

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities
Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2023 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash, which was significantly lower than the net use of cash in 2022 due to efforts in 2023 to optimize inventory levels. The net use of cash in 2023 primarily reflected lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as higher levels of trade receivables, partially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses.
Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2022 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash. This net use of cash primarily reflected higher levels of inventory and prepaid expenses, as well as lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2022 additionally reflected a discretionary cash contribution of $134 million to fund our pension obligation.
Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2021 reflected higher net income, which was driven by strong revenue performance, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash. This net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher levels of prepaid expenses, inventory and trade receivables. Cash flows from continuing operating activities in 2021 additionally reflected a $16 million discretionary cash contribution to fund our pension obligation.
Net Cash Flows from Continuing Investing Activities
Capital expenditures
Our investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities, as well as support our BD 2025 strategy for growth and simplification. Capital expenditures of $874 million, $973 million and $1.194 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to manufacturing capacity expansions. Details of spending by segment are contained in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Acquisitions
Cash outflows for acquisitions in 2022 included a cash payment of $1.548 billion associated with our acquisition of Parata Systems in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as cash payments relating to various strategic acquisitions we have executed as part of our growth strategy, including our acquisitions of MedKeeper, Scanwell Health, Inc, Tissuemed, Ltd., and Venclose, Inc. Cash outflows for acquisitions in 2021 included a cash payment relating to the strategic acquisition of Tepha, Inc.
Divestitures
Cash inflows relating to our divestiture of the Interventional segment's Surgical Instrumentation platform in 2023 were $540 million. For further discussion, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Additional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Cash and Short-term Investments
At September 30, 2023, total worldwide cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash, were $1.489 billion. These assets were largely held in the United States. We regularly review the amount of cash and short-term investments held outside of the United States and our historical foreign earnings are used to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. To fund cash needs in the United States, we rely on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and remittances from foreign subsidiaries of earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested.
Financing Facilities
We have a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility in place which will expire in September 2026. The credit facility, which was amended and restated in January 2023, provides borrowings of up to $2.750 billion, with separate sub-limits of $100 million and $194 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively. The expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods, subject to certain restrictions (including the consent of the lenders). The credit facility provides that we may, subject to additional commitments by lenders, request an additional $500 million of financing, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to $3.250 billion. Proceeds from this facility

may be used for general corporate purposes and Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.à r.l., an indirect, wholly owned finance subsidiary of BD, is authorized as an additional borrower under the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2023.
The agreement for our revolving credit facility contains the following financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants, as applicable, as of September 30, 2023.
•We are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than:
◦4.25-to-1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter following the closing of the credit facility; or
◦4.75-to-1 for the four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a material acquisition.
We may access commercial paper programs over the normal course of our business activities. In March 2023, we amended the agreement for our U.S. commercial paper program. The amendment provided, among other things, an increase of the maximum amount of unsecured borrowings available under the program to $2.750 billion. Also in March 2023, we entered into an agreement to establish a multicurrency euro commercial paper program. This multicurrency program allows for a maximum amount of unsecured borrowings that, when aggregated with the amount outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program, will not exceed $2.750 billion at any time. Proceeds from these programs may be used for working capital purposes and general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, share repurchases and repayments of debt. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023. We have additional informal lines of credit outside the United States. Also, over the normal course of our business activities, we transfer certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements. Additional disclosures regarding sales of trade receivable assets are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Access to Capital and Credit Ratings
Our corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (“S&P”), Moody's Investor Service (“Moody's”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) were as follows at September 30, 2023:

--------------------- ------ ------- ------
 S&P Moody’s Fitch
Ratings:
Senior Unsecured Debt BBB Baa2 BBB
Commercial Paper A-2 P-2 F2
Outlook Stable Stable Stable

Our corporate credit ratings at September 30, 2023 were unchanged compared with our ratings at September 30, 2022. S&P, Moody’s and Fitch assigned ratings of A-2, P-2 and F2, respectively, to the multicurrency euro commercial paper program we entered into in March 2023. These ratings were consistent with the ratings already assigned to our U.S. commercial paper program.
Lower corporate debt ratings and downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing. We believe that given our debt ratings, our financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the non-cyclical, geographically diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.
Contractual Obligations
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under purchase, debt and lease arrangements are provided in Notes 6, 16 and 18, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given estimate or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement. Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.
Our agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment. The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.
Our gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, including rebates. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period. Additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates.
Impairment of Assets
Goodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, and other long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present.
We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units represent one level below reporting segments. Our review of goodwill for each reporting unit compares the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment

43

Table of Contents
test performed on July 1, 2023 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.
We generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income producing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BD’s business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset. Actual results may differ from management’s estimates.
Income Taxes
BD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.
BD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we record accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. BD’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.
We have reviewed our needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs. As a result, we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2023. Additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Contingencies
We are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. We establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (and in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). A determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after analysis of each individual matter. When appropriate, the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and, in the case of certain mass tort litigation, actuarial specialists regarding the nature, timing and extent of each matter. The accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our litigation strategy. We record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when realization of recovery is deemed probable.
Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the

44

Table of Contents
aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition and/or consolidated cash flows.
Benefit Plans
We have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations that are measured using actuarial valuations which include assumptions for the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.
The discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (September 30). Specifically for the U.S. plans, we will use a discount rate of 6.01% for 2024, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date. To calculate the pension expense in 2024, we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost. Additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2024 are provided in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long-term nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We will use a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 7.5% for the U.S. pension plan in 2024. We believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows:
•Discount rate — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $5 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs. This estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost.
•Expected return on plan assets — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $3 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan costs.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. BD and its representatives may also, from time to time, make certain forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “will,” “may,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance (including volume growth, pricing, sales and earnings per share growth, and cash flows) and statements regarding our strategy for growth, liquidity, future product development, regulatory approvals, competitive position and expenditures. All statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management’s then-current views and

45

Table of Contents
assumptions regarding future events, developments and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations.
The following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report and our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
•General global, regional or national economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital market volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession, that may result in unfavorable conditions that could negatively affect demand for our products and services, impact the prices we can charge for our products and services, disrupt our supply chain. impair our ability to produce our products, or increase borrowing costs.
•The impact of inflation and disruptions in our global supply chain on BD and our suppliers (particularly sole-source suppliers and providers of sterilization services), including fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, used in the production or sterilization of our products, transportation constraints and delays, product shortages, energy shortages or increased energy costs, labor shortages or disputes, and increased operating and labor costs.
•Conditions in international markets, including social and political conditions, geopolitical developments such as the ongoing situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, economic sanctions, export controls, tariffs and other protectionist measures and barriers to market participation (such as local company and products preferences), difficulties in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and governmental expropriation of assets. Our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and bribery laws, as well as regulatory and privacy laws.
•Competitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions and technologies (for example, new forms of drug delivery or novel medical therapies) by our current or future competitors, consolidation or strategic alliances among healthcare companies, distributors and/or payers of healthcare to improve their competitive position or develop new models for the delivery of healthcare, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), new entrants into our markets and changes in the practice of medicine.
•Changes in the way healthcare services are delivered, including transition of more care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management, which may affect the demand for our products and services. Additionally, budget constraints and staffing shortages, particularly shortages of nursing staff, may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products and services.
•Our ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.
•Changes in the coverage or reimbursement landscape, or adverse decisions relating to our products by governments or third-party payers, which could reduce demand for our products or the price we can charge for such products.
•Cost-containment efforts in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, such as alternative payment reform and increased use of competitive bidding and tenders, including, without limitation, any

46

Table of Contents
expansion of the volume-based procurement process in China or the implementation of similar cost-containment efforts.
•Risks relating to our overall level of indebtedness, including our ability to service our debt and refinance our indebtedness, which is dependent upon the capital markets and the overall macroeconomic environment and our financial condition at such time.
•Changes in the domestic and foreign healthcare industry or in medical practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including cost-reduction measures instituted by and the continued consolidation among healthcare providers.
•The effects of regulatory or other events (such as public health crises) that adversely impact our supply chain, including our ability to manufacture (including sterilize) our products (particularly where production of a product line or sterilization operations are concentrated in one or more plants), source materials or components or services from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing (including sterilization), or provide products to our customers, including events that impact key distributors. In particular, there has been increased regulatory focus on the use and emission of ethylene oxide in sterilization processes, and additional regulatory requirements have been proposed and may be imposed in the future that could adversely impact BD or our third-party sterilization providers.
•Security breaches of our information and technology systems or our products, which could impair our ability to conduct business, result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of patients, including sensitive personal data, or result in product efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products, and result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.
•Product efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product holds or recalls, regulatory action on the part of the FDA or foreign counterparts (including restrictions on future product clearances and civil penalties), declining sales and product liability claims, and damage to our reputation. As a result of the CareFusion acquisition, our U.S. infusion pump business is operating under a Consent Decree with the FDA. The Consent Decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order our U.S. infusion pump business to cease manufacturing and distributing products, recall products or take other actions, and order the payment of significant monetary damages if the business subject to the decree fails to comply with any provision of the Consent Decree. In accordance with our commitments to the FDA, the overall timing of replacement or remediation of the BD Alaris™ Infusion Systems and return to market in the U.S. may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity and our continued engagement with the FDA.
•Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and registrations in the U.S. and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which could preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs.
•Any impact that public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, including COVID-19, may have on our business, the global economy and the global healthcare system. This may include decreases in the demand for our products, disruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers and customers, disruptions to our supply chain, or increases in transportation costs.
•The impact of changes in U.S. federal or foreign laws and policies that could affect fiscal and tax policies, taxation (including tax reforms, such as the implementation of a global minimum tax, that could adversely impact multinational corporations), and international trade, including import and export

47

Table of Contents
regulation and international trade agreements. In particular, tariffs, sanctions or other trade barriers imposed by the U.S. or other countries could adversely impact our supply chain costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations.
•The risks associated with the spin-off of our former Diabetes Care business, including factors that could adversely affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of the spin-off, or the qualification of the spin-off as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
•The impact of business combinations or divestitures, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquisition-related costs, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.
•Our ability to penetrate or expand our operations in emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks.
•Deficit reduction efforts or other actions that reduce the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, which could weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales.
•Fluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.
•Our ability to recruit and retain key employees and the impact of labor conditions which could increase employee turnover or increase our labor and operating costs and negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our business.
•Fluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.
•The impact of climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, such as regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, zero-carbon energy and sustainability mandates, and additional taxes on fuel and energy, and changing customer preferences and requirements, such as those regarding the use of materials of concern, increased demand for products with lower environmental footprints, and for companies to set and demonstrate progress against greenhouse gas reduction plans and targets.
•Natural disasters, including the impacts of hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, fires, earthquakes and floods and other extreme weather events, global health pandemics, war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts that could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability, resulting in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or cause interruptions in our supply chain.
•Pending and potential future litigation or other proceedings asserting, and/or investigations concerning and/or subpoenas and requests seeking information with respect to, alleged violations of law (including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid) and/or sales and marketing practices (such as investigative subpoenas and the civil investigative demands received by BD)), potential anti-corruption and related internal control violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, antitrust claims, securities law claims, product liability (which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including pending claims relating to our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence products for women, vena cava filter products and implantable ports), claims with respect to environmental matters, data privacy breaches and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.
•New or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including, without limitation, laws relating to sales practices, environmental protection and reporting, price controls, privacy, cybersecurity, and licensing and regulatory

48

requirements for new products and products in the post-marketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD.
•The effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BD’s business or operations, including the effect on BD’s reputation or demand for its products.
•The effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BD’s pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.
•Our ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.
•Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the FASB or the SEC.
The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.

(6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. The 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) Senior Notes In January 2015, we issued $1 billion of senior notes due February 1, 2025. The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. In February 2020, we issued $500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2023, $500 million of senior notes due February 1, 2025, $850 million of senior notes due February 1, 2027, and $1.30 billion of senior notes due February 1, 2030. Our total proceeds of approximately $3.14 billion, net of issuance discount, were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt instruments due in fiscal 2020. The related discount and issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022...

(6)This reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. The 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19. (7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.

[Notes 4 and 16]:
(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

Key Trends Affecting Results of Operations
Our operations, supply chain, suppliers and customers are exposed to various global macroeconomic factors. The factors which were most impactful to our fiscal year 2023 results included the following:
•Inflation continued to drive higher costs of raw materials, electronic components, labor, energy, and logistical services. We expect inflation to persist into our fiscal year 2024, but at levels lower than our fiscal year 2023.
•A limited supply of skilled labor in certain markets drove higher overall labor costs, as noted above, and we expect labor availability will continue to be a macroeconomic challenge for our operations.
•The availability of energy sources in certain markets, as well as the availability of certain raw materials and electronic components on a global basis.

•Logistics capacity constraints eased in our fiscal year 2023 compared to 2022 and lead times improved in most key routes. However, adequate supply of transportation capacity is critical to our operations and constrained capacity may unfavorably impact our results of operations.
Current healthcare delivery has transitioned more care from acute to non-acute settings and has increased focus on chronic disease management; this transition has placed additional financial pressure on hospitals and the broader healthcare system. Healthcare institutions may take actions to mitigate any persistent pressures on their budgets and such actions could impact the future demand for our products and services. Additionally, a worsening of staffing shortages within healthcare systems may affect the prioritization of healthcare services, which could also impact the demand for certain of our products.
Certain geopolitical conditions, including the evolving situations in Ukraine, the Middle East and Asia, may contribute to the macroeconomic conditions discussed above. While these geopolitical conditions have not materially impacted our results of operations to date, the continuation and/or an escalation of these evolving situations may further weaken the global economy and could result in additional inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints, including the unavailability and cost of energy.
 Additionally, governments in China and other countries use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders as well as price regulation. During our fiscal year 2023, regional and national volume-based procurement programs (“VoBP”) established by the government in China unfavorably impacted our revenues and we anticipate that these programs may continue to impact our results of operations.
We continue to invest in research and development, strategic tuck-in acquisitions, geographic expansion, and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including geographical expansion), develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness.
We have been mitigating the impacts of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above through various strategies which leverage our procurement, logistics and manufacturing capabilities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively mitigate these pressures in future periods and an inability to offset these pressures through our strategies, at least in part, could adversely impact our results of operations. Due to the significant uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the macroeconomic and other factors discussed above, our future operating performance, particularly in the short-term, may be subject to volatility. The impacts of macroeconomic and other conditions on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows are dependent on certain factors, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Summary of Financial Results
Worldwide revenues in 2023 of $19.372 billion increased 2.7% from the prior-year period. This increase reflected the following impacts:

----------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- -
 Increase (decrease) in current-period revenues
Volume/other 3.0 %
Period-over-period decline in revenues related to COVID-19-only testing (2.3) %
Pricing 3.8 %
Foreign currency translation (1.8) %

Increase in revenues from the prior-year period 2.7 %

Our fiscal year 2023 revenues reflected sales in our Life Sciences segment related to COVID-19-only diagnostic testing on the BD VeritorTM Plus and BD MaxTM Systems of $73 million, compared with revenues from such testing products in 2022 of $511 million.

Our financial position remains strong, with cash flows from continuing operating activities totaling $2.990 billion in 2023. At September 30, 2023, we had $1.489 billion in cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash. We continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends. During fiscal year 2023, we paid cash dividends of $1.114 billion, including $1.046 billion paid to common shareholders and $68 million paid to preferred shareholders.
Each reporting period, we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period. A stronger U.S. dollar, compared to the prior-year period, resulted in an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues and earnings during our fiscal year 2023. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods.
