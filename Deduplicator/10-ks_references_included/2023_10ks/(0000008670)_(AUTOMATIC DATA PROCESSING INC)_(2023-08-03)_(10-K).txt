Tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts

The following section discusses our year ended June 30, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”), as compared to year ended June 30, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”). A detailed review of our fiscal 2022 performance compared to our fiscal 2021 performance is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.

Risk Factors,” and in other written or oral statements made from time to time by ADP, should be considered in evaluating any forward-looking statements contained herein.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

In addition to our U.S. GAAP results, we use adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate and organic constant currency are all non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for a discussion of why ADP believes these measures are important and for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures.

We are a leading global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (“HCM”) technology solutions to employers around the world. Our HCM solutions, which include both software and outsourcing services, are designed to help our clients manage their workforce through a dynamic business and regulatory landscape and the changing world of work. We continuously seek to enhance our leading HCM solutions to further support our clients. We see tremendous growth opportunity ahead as we focus on our three key Strategic Priorities: leading with best-in-class HCM technology, providing unparalleled expertise and outsourcing, and leveraging our global scale for the benefit of our clients. Executing on our Strategic Priorities will be critical to enabling our growth in the years ahead.

During the fiscal year we drove strong progress across a number of key measures and in support of our overall Strategic Priorities. We crossed a major milestone, surpassing the 1 million client mark, driven by continued enhancements to our key solutions like RUN and Workforce Now. We continued the deployment of our unified User Experience to key portions of our portfolio such as the RUN mobile app. We were awarded Top HR Product for the 8th consecutive year at the annual HR Tech Conference, in recognition for our recently launched Intelligent Self Service Solution. And our HR Outsourcing businesses continued to grow, now with over 3 million worksite employees served.

27

For fiscal 2023, we delivered solid revenue growth of 9%, 10% organic constant currency. Our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, grew 4.7% for the year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. PEO average worksite employees increased 6% for the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. Additionally, our strong ES new business bookings performance resulted in full year fiscal 2023 growth of 10%, and client satisfaction gains resulted in a full year ES client revenue retention rate of 92.2%, equal to the highest level we have ever reported. We believe these results are largely attributable to improvements made to our platforms and service over multiple years.

We have a strong business model, generating significant cash flows with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients’ HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our re-investments, longer term strategy, and commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2023 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients.

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS

Total Revenues 18,012.2 16,498.3
YoY Growth 9 % 10 %
YoY Growth, Organic Constant Currency 10 % 10 %

Revenues in fiscal 2023 increased due to new business started from New Business Bookings, an increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, an increase in our pays per control, continued strong client retention, an increase in interest on funds held for clients, and an increase in pricing, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of one percentage point from foreign currency. Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the changes in revenue for each of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services.

Total revenues in fiscal 2023 include interest on funds held for clients of $813.4 million, as compared to $451.8 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from an increase in our average interest rate earned to 2.4% in fiscal 2023, as compared to 1.4% in fiscal 2022, coupled with an increase in our average client funds balances of 5.1% to $34.1 billion in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.

Total expenses $ 13,758.1 $ 12,777.0 8 %

For the year ended June 30:

Operating expenses increased due to an increase in our PEO Services zero-margin benefits pass-through costs to $3,800.9 million from $3,514.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, operating expenses increased due to increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency and a net reduction of $12.3 million in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity.

Systems development and programming costs increased for fiscal 2023 due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our new and existing products.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to the amortization of internally developed software products and new investments in purchased software.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to increased selling expenses as a result of investments in our sales organization, increased marketing expenses, and a reversal of COVID-19 credit loss reserves of $26.0 million in 2022, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency.

Interest expense increased due to the increase in average interest rates on commercial paper issuances and reverse repurchases to 3.7% and 4.3% for the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to 0.4% and 0.7% for the year ended June 30, 2022, respectively, also coupled with a higher volume of average commercial paper and reverse repurchase borrowings, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.

Interest income on corporate funds increased in fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, due to higher average interest rates of 2.4% for the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to 1.0% for the year ended June 30, 2022, coupled with higher average investment balances for the year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. See Note 10 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on non-service components of pension income, net.

In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded impairment charges of $23.0 million, which is comprised of $12.1 million related to software and customer lists which were determined to have no future use and impairment charges of $10.9 million related to operating right-of-use assets associated with exiting certain leases early.

Adjusted EBIT $ 4,467.9 $ 3,871.8 15 %
Adjusted EBIT Margin 24.8 % 23.5 % 130 bps

Earnings before income taxes increased due to the increases in revenues partially offset by the increases in expenses discussed above.

Overall margin increased due to increases in revenues discussed above, and operating efficiencies for costs of servicing our clients on growing revenue, partially offset by increased selling expenses, increased interest expense, and increases in zero-margin pass through costs.

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin exclude interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds
extended investment strategy, and net charges, including gain on sale of assets related to our broad-based transformation
initiatives and the impact of net severance charges relating to these initiatives, as applicable, in the respective periods.

Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 23.1% and 22.5%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an intercompany transfer of certain assets that resulted in a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 and higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes

The adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2023 and 2022 was 23.1% and 22.5%, respectively. The drivers of the adjusted effective tax rate are the same as the drivers of the effective tax rate discussed above.

Net Earnings and Diluted EPS, Unadjusted and Adjusted

Adjusted net earnings $ 3,419.5 $ 2,951.6 16 %
Adjusted diluted EPS $ 8.23 $ 7.01 17 %

30

Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS reflect the changes in components described above.

Diluted EPS increased as a result of the increase in net earnings and the impact of fewer shares outstanding resulting from the repurchase of approximately 4.9 million shares during fiscal 2023 and 9.2 million shares during fiscal 2022, partially offset by the issuances of shares under our employee benefit plans.

For fiscal 2023, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted EPS reflect the changes in components described above.

Employer Services

Revenues

Revenues increased due to new business started from New Business Bookings, an increase in our pays per control of 5%, continued strong client retention, an increase in interest earned on funds held for clients, and an increase in pricing, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of one percentage point from foreign currency.

Earnings before Income Taxes

Employer Services' earnings before income taxes increased in fiscal 2023 due to increased revenues discussed above, partially offset by increases in expenses. The increases in expenses were due to increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, increases in selling expenses, and investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our new and existing products.

Margin

Employer Services' margin increased due to increases in revenues discussed above, and operating efficiencies for costs of servicing our clients on growing revenue, partially offset by an increase in selling expenses.

PEO Services' revenues excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs $ 2,183.3 $ 2,031.3 $ 152.0 7 %

PEO Services' revenues increased 8% for fiscal 2023 due to increases in average worksite employees of 6% for fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, and due to an increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs.

Earnings before Income Taxes

PEO Services’ earnings before income taxes increased 12% in fiscal 2023 due to increases in revenues discussed above and a net reduction of $12.3 million in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity, partially offset by the increases in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs of $286.5 million for fiscal 2023.

Margin

PEO Services' overall margin increased for fiscal 2023 due to increases in revenues discussed above, lower state unemployment and workers compensation insurance costs, and changes in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity, partially offset by increases in selling expenses.

32

ADP Indemnity provides workers’ compensation and employer’s liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services’ worksite employees up to $1 million per occurrence. PEO Services has secured a workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance policy that caps the exposure for each claim at $1 million per occurrence and has also secured aggregate stop loss insurance that caps aggregate losses at a certain level in fiscal years 2012 and prior from an admitted and licensed insurance company of AIG. We utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability, and changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are included in the PEO segment.

Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2013, ADP Indemnity paid premiums to enter into reinsurance arrangements with ACE American Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chubb Limited (“Chubb”), to cover substantially all losses incurred by the Company up to the $1 million per occurrence related to the workers' compensation and employer's liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for PEO Services' worksite employees. Each of these reinsurance arrangements limits our overall exposure incurred up to a certain limit. The Company believes the likelihood of ultimate losses exceeding this limit is remote. During fiscal 2023, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $284 million to enter into a reinsurance arrangement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2023 policy year up to $1 million per occurrence. ADP Indemnity recorded a pre-tax benefit of approximately $73 million in fiscal 2023 and a pre-tax benefit of approximately $61 million in fiscal 2022, which were primarily a result of changes in our estimated actuarial losses. ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $269 million in July 2023, to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for fiscal 2024 policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal 2023 reinsurance policy.

Other

The primary components of “Other” are certain corporate overhead charges and expenses that have not been allocated to the reportable segments, including corporate functions, costs related to our transformation office, severance costs, non-recurring gains and losses, the elimination of intercompany transactions, and all other interest income and expense.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to our GAAP results, we use the adjusted results and other non-GAAP metrics set forth in the table below to evaluate our operating performance in the absence of certain items and for planning and forecasting of future periods:

----------------------------------- --------------------------
Adjusted Financial Measures U.S. GAAP Measures
Adjusted EBIT Net earnings
Adjusted provision for income taxes Provision for income taxes
Adjusted net earnings Net earnings

Adjusted diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share
Adjusted effective tax rate Effective tax rate

Organic constant currency Revenues

We believe that the exclusion of the identified items helps us reflect the fundamentals of our underlying business model and analyze results against our expectations and against prior periods, and to plan for future periods by focusing on our underlying operations. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management and improves their ability to understand and assess our operating performance.  The nature of these exclusions is for specific items that are not fundamental to our underlying business operations.  Since these adjusted financial measures and other non-GAAP metrics are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to their corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures at other companies.

(a) In adjusted EBIT, we include the interest income earned on investments associated with our client funds extended investment strategy and interest expense on borrowings related to our client funds extended investment strategy as we believe these amounts to be fundamental to the underlying operations of our business model. The adjustments in the table above represent the interest income and interest expense that are not related to our client funds extended investment strategy and are labeled as “All other interest expense” and “All other interest income.”

(b) In fiscal 2023, the charges include consulting costs relating to our company-wide transformation initiatives, partially offset by net reversals relating to severance. Unlike other severance charges which are not included as an adjustment to get to adjusted results, these specific charges relate to actions taken as part of our broad-based, company-wide transformation initiatives.

(c) Represents net charges (reserves and insurance recovery) from legal matters during fiscal 2023.

(d) The income tax (benefit)/provision was calculated based on the marginal rate in effect for the year ended June 30, 2023.

(e) The Adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as our Adjusted provision for income taxes divided by the sum of our Adjusted net earnings plus our Adjusted provision for income taxes.

The following table reconciles our reported growth rates to the non-GAAP measure of organic constant currency, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, the impact of dispositions, and the impact of foreign currency. The impact of acquisitions and dispositions is calculated by excluding the current year revenues of acquisitions until the one-year anniversary of the transaction and by excluding the prior year revenues of divestitures for the one-year period preceding the transaction. The impact of foreign currency is determined by calculating the current year results using foreign exchange rates consistent with the

34

prior year. The PEO segment is not impacted by acquisitions, dispositions or foreign currency.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of June 30, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion, which were primarily invested in time deposits and money market funds.

For corporate liquidity, we expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities, cash flow from operations together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to access both long-term and short-term debt financing from the capital markets will be adequate to meet our operating, investing, and financing activities such as regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2023 and we have sufficient liquidity.

For client funds liquidity, we have the ability to borrow through our financing arrangements under our U.S. short-term commercial paper program and our U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom short-term reverse repurchase agreements, together with our $9.7 billion of committed credit facilities and our ability to use corporate liquidity when necessary to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Please see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a further discussion of the risks related to our client funds extended investment strategy. See Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including commercial paper.

Operating, Investing and Financing Cash Flows

Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows are summarized as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------- ---------- ---- --------- - ------- -------- ---------- - ----------
 Years ended June 30,
 2023 2022 $ Change
Cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 4,207.6 $ 3,099.5 $ 1,108.1
Investing activities (2,517.3) (7,014.4) 4,497.1
Financing activities (15,680.7) 13,653.4 (29,334.1)
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents (21.1) (98.7) 77.6
Net change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents $ (14,011.5) $ 9,639.8 $ (23,651.3)

35

Net cash flows provided by operating activities increased due to growth in our underlying business (net income adjusted for non-cash adjustments), and a net favorable change in the components of operating assets and liabilities primarily due to timing on collections of accounts receivable, and a decrease in incentive compensation payments, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.

Net cash flows used in investing activities changed due to the timing of proceeds and purchases of corporate and client funds marketable securities of $4,570.2 million, offset by higher payments for capital expenditures in fiscal 2023, and the sale of property, plant, and equipment in fiscal 2022.

Net cash flows used in financing activities changed due to a net decrease in the cash flow from client funds obligations of $29,759.5 million, which is due to the timing of impounds from our clients and payments to our clients' employees and other payees, an increase in dividends paid, and a net decrease in reverse repurchase agreements borrowing, offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock in fiscal 2023.

We purchased approximately 4.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $227.30 during fiscal 2023, as compared to purchases of 9.2 million shares at an average price per share of $214.40 during fiscal 2022. From time to time, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. The Company considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, actual and potential acquisition activity, cash balances and cash flows, issuances due to employee benefit plan activity, and market conditions.

Capital Resources and Client Fund Obligations

We have $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturity dates in 2025, 2028, and 2030. We may from time to time revisit the long-term debt market to refinance existing debt, finance investments including acquisitions for our growth, and maintain the appropriate capital structure. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our notes.

Our U.S. short-term funding requirements related to client funds are sometimes obtained on an unsecured basis through the issuance of commercial paper, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. This commercial paper program provides for the issuance of up to $9.7 billion in aggregate maturity value. Our commercial paper program is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, Prime-1 (“P-1”) by Moody’s and F1+ by Fitch. These ratings denote the highest quality commercial paper securities. Maturities of commercial paper can range from overnight to up to 364 days. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, we had no commercial paper borrowing outstanding. Details of the borrowings under the commercial paper program are as follows:

------------------------------------------------- ------ --- ----- --- - ---
Years ended June 30, 2023 2022
Average daily borrowings (in billions) $ 3.4 $ 2.0
Weighted average interest rates 3.7 % 0.4 %
Weighted average maturity (approximately in days) 2 days 1 day

Our U.S., Canadian, and United Kingdom short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations are sometimes obtained on a secured basis through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, which are collateralized principally by government and government agency securities, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. These agreements generally have terms ranging from overnight to up to five business days. We have successfully borrowed through the use of reverse repurchase agreements on an as-needed basis to meet short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, there were $105.4 million and $136.4 million, respectively, of outstanding obligations related to the reverse repurchase agreements. Details of the reverse repurchase agreements are as follows:

Years ended June 30, 2023 2022
Average outstanding balances $ 1,279.9 $ 299.6
Weighted average interest rates 4.3 % 0.7 %

We vary the maturities of our committed credit facilities to limit the refinancing risk of any one facility. We have a $4.25 billion, 364-day credit agreement that matures in June 2024 with a one year term-out option. In addition, we have a five-year $3.2 billion credit facility and a five-year $2.25 billion credit facility maturing in June 2026 and June 2028, respectively, each with an accordion feature under which the aggregate commitment can be increased by $500 million, subject to the availability

36

of additional commitments. The primary uses of the credit facilities are to provide liquidity to the commercial paper program and funding for general corporate purposes, if necessary. We had no borrowings through June 30, 2023 under the credit facilities. We believe that we currently meet all conditions set forth in the revolving credit agreements to borrow thereunder, and we are not aware of any conditions that would prevent us from borrowing part or all of the $9.7 billion available to us under the revolving credit agreements. See Note 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our short-term financing including credit facilities.

Our investment portfolio does not contain any asset-backed securities with underlying collateral of sub-prime mortgages, alternative-A mortgages, sub-prime auto loans or sub-prime home equity loans, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, credit default swaps, derivatives, auction rate securities, structured investment vehicles or non-investment grade fixed-income securities. We own AAA-rated senior tranches of primarily fixed rate auto loan, credit card, and equipment lease receivables, secured predominantly by prime collateral. All collateral on asset-backed securities is performing as expected through June 30, 2023. In addition, we own U.S. government securities which primarily include debt directly issued by Federal Farm Credit Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). This investment strategy is supported by our short-term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short-term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations. See Note 4 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our corporate investments and funds held for clients.

Capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 were $206.0 million, as compared to $177.1 million for fiscal 2022. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2024 to be between $200 million and $225 million.

Contractual Obligations

Our contractual obligations at June 30, 2023 relate primarily to operating leases (Note 6) and other arrangements recorded in our balance sheet or disclosed in the notes to our financial statements, including benefit plan obligations (Note 10), liabilities for uncertain tax positions (Note 11), purchase obligations (Note 12), debt obligations (Note 9) and $263.5 million of interest payments of our debt, of which $64.3 million is expected to be paid within one year.

In addition to the obligations described above, we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services. As of June 30, 2023, the obligations relating to these matters, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2024, total $38,538.6 million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had $36,333.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities that were impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023.

Separately, ADP Indemnity paid a premium of $269 million in July 2023 to enter into a reinsurance agreement with Chubb to cover substantially all losses incurred by ADP Indemnity for the fiscal 2024 policy year. At June 30, 2023, ADP Indemnity had total assets of $660.8 million to satisfy the actuarially estimated unpaid losses of $552.3 million for the policy years since July 1, 2003. ADP Indemnity paid claims of $0.8 million and $1.8 million, net of insurance recoveries, in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. Refer to the “Analysis of Reportable Segments - PEO Services” above for additional information regarding ADP Indemnity.

In the normal course of business, we also enter into contracts in which we make representations and warranties that relate to the performance of our services and products. We do not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments (cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term marketable securities) and client funds assets (funds that have been collected from clients but have not yet been remitted to the applicable tax authorities, client employees or other payees).

Our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities. These assets are available for our regular quarterly dividends, share repurchases, capital expenditures and/or acquisitions, as well as other corporate operating purposes. All of our short-term and long-term fixed-income securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.

Our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary objectives. Consistent with those objectives, we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income.  Client funds

37

assets are invested in highly liquid, investment-grade marketable securities, with a maximum maturity of 10 years at the time of purchase, and money market securities and other cash equivalents.

We utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short-term financing arrangements to satisfy our short-term funding requirements related to client funds obligations. Our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years (in the case of the extended portfolio) and out to ten years (in the case of the long portfolio). As part of our client funds investment strategy, we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations, rather than liquidating previously-collected client funds that have already been invested in available-for-sale securities. In circumstances where we experience a reduction in employment levels due to a slowdown in the economy, we may make tactical decisions to sell certain securities in order to reduce the size of the funds held for clients to correspond to client funds obligations. We attempt to minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client’s obligation becomes due by generally impounding the client’s funds by the time we pay such client’s obligation. When we don’t impound client funds in advance of paying such client obligations, we are at risk of not recovering such funds or a material delay in such recovery.  Through our clients funds investment strategy and client impounding processes, we have consistently maintained the required level of liquidity to satisfy all of our obligations.

There are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets. Such risks include liquidity risk, including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate, if necessary, our available-for-sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations. However, our investments are made with the safety of principal, liquidity, and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations. We also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity, including our corporate cash balances, available borrowings under our $9.7 billion commercial paper program (rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s, P-1 by Moody’s, and F1+ by Fitch, the highest possible short-term credit ratings), our ability to engage in reverse repurchase agreement transactions and available borrowings under our $9.7 billion committed credit facilities. The reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil, even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings, may limit our ability to access short-term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business. In addition to liquidity risk, our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk, as discussed below.

We have established credit quality, maturity, and exposure limits for our investments. The minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate, Canadian government agency and Canadian provincial bonds is BBB, for asset-backed securities is AAA, and for municipal bonds is A. The maximum maturity at time of purchase for BBB-rated securities is 5 years, and for single A rated, AA-rated and AAA-rated securities it is 10 years. Time deposits and commercial paper must be rated A-1 and/or P-1. Money market funds must be rated AAA/Aaa-mf.

Total available-for-sale securities at fair value $ 29,764.9 $ 28,391.6

We are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature, as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested. Factors that influence the earnings impact of interest rate changes include, among others, the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short-term and long-term investments. This mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes. The annualized interest rate earned on our entire portfolio increased from 1.3% for fiscal 2022 to 2.4% for fiscal 2023. A hypothetical change in both short-term interest rates (e.g., overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate) and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $14 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2024. A hypothetical change in only short-term interest rates of 25 basis points applied to the estimated average short-term investment balances and any related short-term borrowings would result in approximately an $5 million impact to earnings before income taxes over the ensuing twelve-month period ending June 30, 2024.

We are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available-for-sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities. We limit credit risk by investing in investment-grade securities, primarily AAA-rated and AA- rated securities, as rated by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, DBRS for Canadian dollar denominated securities, and Fitch for asset-backed and commercial-mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than U.S. government and government agency, Canadian government, and United Kingdom government securities.

We operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. We may use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

See Note 1, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other comprehensive income. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.

The estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. These estimates require levels of subjectivity and judgment, which could result in actual results differing from our estimates. The Company believes the following are its critical accounting estimates:

Deferred Costs - Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain and Fulfill Contracts

Description
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract (e.g., sales commissions) and cost incurred to implement clients on our solutions (e.g., direct labor) that are expected to be recovered are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the client retention period, depending on the business unit.

Judgments and Uncertainties
The Company has estimated the amortization periods for deferred costs by using its historical retention rates by business unit to estimate the pattern during which the service transfers. The expected client relationship period ranges from three to eight years.

39

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
As the assumptions used to estimate the amortization period of the deferred costs could have a material impact on timing of recognition, we assess the amortization periods annually using historical retention rates. Actual retention rates were not materially different than those used in our calculation to determine the amortization period. We regularly review our deferred costs for impairment. There were no impairment losses incurred during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, June 30, 2022, or June 30, 2021.

Goodwill.

Description
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill might be impaired.

Judgments and Uncertainties
The Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2023 was performed for all reporting units using a quantitative approach by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using, as appropriate, the income approach, which is derived using the present value of future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, and the market approach, which is based upon using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business. Significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates, profitability projections, working capital assumptions, the weighted average cost of capital, the determination of appropriate market comparison companies, and terminal growth rates. Several of these assumptions including projected revenue growth rates and profitability projections are dependent on our ability to upgrade, enhance, and expand our technology and services to meet client needs and preferences.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting units are outside the control of management including the weighted-average cost of capital, tax rates, market comparisons, and terminal growth rates. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in material impairments of our goodwill. The assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with the Company’s operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses.

We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of June 30, 2023 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. We performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a one percentage point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital would not result in an impairment of goodwill for all reporting units and their fair values substantially exceeded their carrying values.

Income Taxes

Description
Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Judgments and Uncertainties
The Company computes its provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required in determining if the “more likely than not” standard has been met when computing the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions.

Sensitivity of Estimate to Change
While the Company considers all of its tax positions fully supportable, the Company is occasionally challenged by various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. If certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company's liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, which include interest and penalties, were $116.9 million and $98.1 million, respectively.

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

[' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, grew 4.7% for the year ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. PEO average worksite employees increased 6% for the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. Additionally, our strong ES new business bookings performance resulted in full year fiscal 2023 growth of 10%, and client satisfaction gains resulted in a full year ES client revenue retention rate of 92.2%, equal to the highest level we have ever reported. We believe these results are largely attributable to improvements made to our platforms and service over multiple years.

We have a strong business model, generating significant cash flows with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients’ HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our re-investments, longer term strategy, and commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. Our financial condition remains solid at June 30, 2023 and we remain well positioned to support our associates and our clients.

Total Revenues 18,012.2 16,498.3
YoY Growth 9 % 10 %
YoY Growth, Organic Constant Currency 10 % 10 %

Revenues in fiscal 2023 increased due to new business started from New Business Bookings, an increase in zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, an increase in our pays per control, continued strong client retention, an increase in interest on funds held for clients, and an increase in pricing, partially offset by an unfavorable impact of one percentage point from foreign currency. Refer to “Analysis of Reportable Segments” for additional discussion of the changes in revenue for each of our reportable segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (“PEO”) Services.

Total revenues in fiscal 2023 include interest on funds held for clients of $813.4 million, as compared to $451.8 million in fiscal 2022. The increase in interest earned on funds held for clients resulted from an increase in our average interest rate earned to 2.4% in fiscal 2023, as compared to 1.4% in fiscal 2022, coupled with an increase in our average client funds balances of 5.1% to $34.1 billion in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022.

Additionally, operating expenses increased due to increased costs to service our client base in support of our growing revenue, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency and a net reduction of $12.3 million in our estimated losses related to ADP Indemnity.

Systems development and programming costs increased for fiscal 2023 due to increased investments and costs to develop, support, and maintain our new and existing products.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased due to the amortization of internally developed software products and new investments in purchased software.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to increased selling expenses as a result of investments in our sales organization, increased marketing expenses, and a reversal of COVID-19 credit loss reserves of $26.0 million in 2022, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency.

Interest expense increased due to the increase in average interest rates on commercial paper issuances and reverse repurchases to 3.7% and 4.3% for the year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to 0.4% and 0.7% for the year ended June 30, 2022, respectively, also coupled with a higher volume of average commercial paper and reverse repurchase borrowings, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2022.

(4)The year-over-year increases in rental locations and employees include the impact of the December 2022 acquisition of assets of Ahern Rentals, Inc. ("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...
