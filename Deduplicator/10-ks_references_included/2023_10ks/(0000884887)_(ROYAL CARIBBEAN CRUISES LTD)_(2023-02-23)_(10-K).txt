Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). (Refer to Note 1. General and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Certain of our accounting policies are deemed "critical," as they require management's highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows:
Management's Plan and Liquidity
In the face of the global pandemic impact of COVID-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in March 2020 and began resuming guest cruise operations in 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022.
As part of our liquidity management, we rely on estimates of our future liquidity which include numerous assumptions that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The principal assumptions used to estimate our future liquidity consist of:
•Expected timing of cash collections for cruise bookings;
•Expected sustained increase in revenue per available passenger cruise day;
•Expected increase in occupancy levels, reaching historical levels in the spring of 2023; and
•Inflationary increases to our operating costs, mostly impacting the expected cost of fuel and food as compared to 2019.
We will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. Actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities.
Ship Accounting
Ships represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 10%-15% projected residual value, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally 30-35 years. The 30-35 year useful life and 10%-15% residual value is the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems. However, we estimate the costs, useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives, as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry. We do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within Cruise operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.
We periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed.
We use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel's age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The

28

significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel's designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.
We use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss on disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place. We also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel's Class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred.
We believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes. However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year, depreciation expense for 2022 would have increased by approximately $85.0 million. If our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2022 would have increased by approximately $307.6 million. We have evaluated our estimated ship useful lives and projected residual values in light of our current environment and determined that there are no changes to these estimates.
Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets
We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely than-not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, and if necessary, a goodwill impairment test. Factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The goodwill impairment analysis consists of a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. We typically estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model, which may also include a combination of a market-based valuation approach. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, interest rates, ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry's competitive environment and general economic and business conditions, among other factors. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2022 impairment assessment consisted of:
•Forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;
•Occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries;
•Vessel operating expenses;
•Terminal growth rate; and
•Weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).
The discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base. We discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital.
If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no write-down of goodwill is required. As amended by ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) – Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to such reporting unit. Refer to Note 4. Goodwill to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on goodwill.

29

The impairment review for indefinite-life intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method, for trademarks and trade names. The principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model for our 2022 impairment assessment consisted of:
•Forecasted revenues per available passenger cruise day;
•Occupancy rates from existing and expected ship deliveries;
•Terminal growth rate;
•Royalty rate; and
•Weighted average cost of capital (i.e., discount rate).
If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 5. Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on indefinite-life intangible assets.
We review our ships and other long-lived assets, including right-of-use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on recent and projected cash flow performance and remaining useful lives, that the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value. Refer to Note 6. Property and Equipment to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on determination of fair value for long-lived assets.
We estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If active markets are not available, we base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk. Quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets. Accordingly, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset using an expected present value technique.
Royal Caribbean International Reporting Unit
During the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit's fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our Royal Caribbean reporting unit was $296.4 million.
We did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Royal Caribbean International's goodwill during 2022 as no triggering events were identified.
Silversea Cruises Reporting Unit
During the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we performed our annual impairment review of Silversea Cruises goodwill. We did not perform qualitative assessments but instead proceeded directly to the goodwill impairment tests. As of November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2021, the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market-based valuation approach. As a result of the tests, we determined the fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 26% and 35% as of November 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' goodwill. The carrying value of goodwill attributable to our Silversea Cruises reporting unit was $508.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

30

During the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we performed our annual impairment reviews of the Silversea Cruises trade name. As a result of the quantitative tests, we determined that the fair value of the Silversea Cruises' trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 25% and 19%, as of November 30, 2022 and November 30, 2021, respectively, resulting in no impairment to Silversea Cruises' trade name.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of indefinite-life intangible assets was $321.5 million, which primarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name.
We did not perform interim impairment evaluations of Silversea Cruises's goodwill or trade names during 2022 and 2021, as no triggering events were identified.
Derivative Instruments
We enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. Although some of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance. Refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on related authoritative guidance, the Company's hedging programs and derivative financial instruments.
On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options with third-party institutions in over-the-counter markets. We estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments' contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options’ contract terms, such as exercise price and maturity, and readily available market data, such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments.
We estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps' contract terms and forward prices. We derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets. We apply present value techniques to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. We also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties.
We adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk.
We believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps, fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions, inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience.
Contingencies—Litigation
On an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.

31

Seasonality
Our revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises. Demand has historically been strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere's summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have historically focused on deployment to the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period. This seasonal trend was disrupted with the voluntary suspension of our global cruise operations effective March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. We resumed our global cruise operations commencing in the second half of 2021, with our full fleet in service by June 2022. Since our full fleet is in service, we expect to return to seasonal trends

Financial Presentation
Description of Certain Line Items
Revenues
Our revenues are comprised of the following:
•Passenger ticket revenues, which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships; and
•Onboard and other revenues, which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and/or services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices, cancellation fees, sales of vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities. Onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and/or services onboard our ships, as well as revenues received for procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates.
Cruise Operating Expenses
Our cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following:
•Commissions, transportation and other expenses, which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues, including travel advisor commissions, air and other transportation expenses, port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees;
•Onboard and other expenses, which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues, including the costs of products sold onboard our ships, vacation protection insurance premiums, costs associated with pre- and post-cruise tours and related credit card fees, as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues, as the costs are mostly incurred by third-party concessionaires and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates;
•Payroll and related expenses, which consist of costs for shipboard personnel (costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in Marketing, selling and administrative expenses);
•Food expenses, which include food costs for both guests and crew;
•Fuel expenses, which include fuel and related delivery, storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements; and
•Other operating expenses, which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts, vessel related insurance, entertainment and gains and/or losses related to the sale of our ships, if any.
We do not allocate payroll and related expenses, food expenses, fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience.
Selected Operational and Financial Metrics
We utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition. As discussed in more detail herein, certain of these metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided along with the related GAAP financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in

32

accordance with GAAP. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included (i) other expenses, which includes our loss contingency in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation recorded in 2022; (ii) impairment and credit losses; (iii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (iv) equity investment asset impairments; (v) net insurance recoveries or costs related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas; (vi) Pullmantur reorganization settlement; (vii) the net gain recognized in 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand; (viii) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. and (ix) transaction costs related to the 2018 Silversea Cruises acquisition. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations.
Adjusted Loss per Share ("Adjusted EPS") is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. A reconciliation of Loss per Share to Adjusted Loss per share is provided below under Results of Operations.
Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is a non-GAAP measure that represents net loss less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included (i) loss on the extinguishment of debt; (ii) the amortization of non-cash debt discount on our convertible notes; (iii) the estimated cash refund expected to be paid to Pullmantur guests and other expenses incurred as part of the Pullmantur S.A. reorganization; (iv) impairment and credit losses; (v) equity investment asset impairments; (vi) net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas; (vii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (viii) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; for 2020, the change in the fair value in the Silversea Cruises contingent consideration;(ix) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. (previously known as Silversea Cruises Group Ltd.) noncontrolling interest in Silversea Cruises, which noncontrolling interest we acquired on July 9, 2020; (x) the net gain recognized in the first quarter of 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand; (xi) currency translation losses recognized during the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the ships classified as assets held-for-sale that were previously chartered to Pullmantur; (xii) the net loss recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the elimination of the three-month reporting lag for Silversea Cruises; and (xiii) loss contingency recorded in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation inclusive of related legal fees and costs. A reconciliation of Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is provided below under Results of Operations.
Available Passenger Cruise Days ("APCD") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.
EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. A reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. to EBITDA is provided below under Results of Operations.
Gross Cruise Costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.
Carbon Intensity is our measurement of carbon dioxide emissions per gross tonne nautical mile (well-to-wake).
Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel are non-GAAP measures that represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, fuel expenses (each of which is described above under the Description of Certain Line Items heading). In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. A reconciliation of Gross Cruise

33

Costs to Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel is provided below under Results of Operations. For the 2022 period presented, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel excludes restructuring and other initiative expenses.
Occupancy ("Load factor"), in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.
Passenger Cruise Days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.
Although discussed in prior periods, we did not disclose or reconcile in this report our Gross Yields and Net Yields, as defined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Historically, we have utilized these financial metrics to measure relevant rate comparisons to other periods. However, our 2022 and 2021 reduction in capacity and revenues, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, do not allow for a meaningful analysis and comparison of these metrics and as such these metrics have been excluded from this report. For Gross Cruise Costs, Net Cruise Costs, and Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel we present amounts in constant currency compared to 2019, which is the last year of normalized operations.

Executive Overview
2022 was a transitional year filled with numerous accomplishments. We returned our entire fleet into operations, took delivery of Celebrity Beyond and Wonder of the Seas, and acquired Silver Endeavour. Additionally, we achieved positive EBITDA and operating cash flow for the year, controlled costs to minimize the impacts of inflation, and saw record shipboard revenues for the year.
Our 2022 Net Loss was $(2.2) billion, or $(8.45) per diluted share, compared to Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $1.9 billion, or $8.95 per diluted share in 2019, the most recent year of normalized operations. Adjusted Net Loss for 2022 was $(1.9) billion, or $(7.50) per diluted share, compared to Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $2.0 billion, or $9.54 per diluted share in 2019. 2022 adjusted EBITDA was $711.6 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $3.6 billion in 2019. We started 2022 by operating 51 ships and sailing at 57% load factor in the first quarter of 2022. We successfully completed the return of our entire fleet into operations during the second quarter and achieved 96% load factors in the third quarter with the Caribbean eclipsing triple digits at close to 105% during the third quarter. We finished the year sailing at almost 100% load factor in December 2022, with holiday sailings close to 110% during the fourth quarter.
Despite only partially operating for the first half of the year, total revenues were $8.8 billion in 2022, compared to $11.0 billion in 2019. Load factors for 2022 were 85%, and 96% for the second half of the year. Additionally, total revenue per passenger cruise day in 2022 was higher than record 2019 levels, driven by strong onboard revenue performance.
Cruise operating expenses increased from $6.1 billion in 2019 to $6.6 billion in 2022. Gross Cruise Costs per APCD increased 8.2% as-reported and 8.8% in Constant Currency, compared to 2019. Net Cruise Costs, excluding Fuel, per APCD increased 12.9% as-reported and 13.5% in Constant Currency, compared to 2019. Our cost-conscious mindset has helped to mitigate the effects of inflation, and we benefited from reduced costs related to health protocols as the year went on. For the year Net Cruise Costs included $5.97 per APCD of transitory costs related to health protocols, and one-time lagging costs related to fleet ramp up. 2022 also included Galveston terminal construction costs and increased costs associated with CocoCay, which were not present in 2019.
In 2023, we expect our capacity to increase by 14% compared to 2019, despite the reduction in capacity resulting from the divestiture of Azamara and the sale of older ships. Since 2019 we have welcomed 9 new ships across our five brands, and with the addition of Celebrity Ascent and Silver Nova in 2023 we expect a total of 11 new vessels operating by year end. These new ships, along with enhanced onboard offerings and continued investment in destinations, are expected to help drive increases in both Net Yields and Total revenues as our capacity expands. We also plan to continue investing in both more efficient newbuilds and retrofitting our existing fleet with technology to help reach our long-term goals to reduce carbon intensity. Lastly, we anticipate taking delivery of Icon of the Seas by the end of the year, to begin operating revenue sailings in 2024.

Results of Operations
In addition to the items discussed above under "Executive Overview," significant items for 2022 include:
•Our Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $(2.2) billion and $(1.9) billion, or $(8.45) and $(7.50) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, reflecting our return to full operations, compared to Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Loss attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. of $(5.3) billion and $(4.8) billion, or $(20.89) and $(19.19) per share on a diluted basis, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021
In this section, references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022 and references to 2021 refer to the year ended December 31, 2021.
Revenues
Total revenues increased $7.3 billion, or 477.0%, to $8.8 billion in 2022 from $1.5 billion in 2021.
Passenger ticket revenues comprised 65.5% of our 2022 total revenues. Passenger ticket revenues increased by $4.9 billion, or 515.6% to $5.8 billion in 2022 from $0.9 billion in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $129.8 million.
The remaining 34.5% of total revenues was comprised of Onboard and other revenues, which increased $2.5 billion, or 415.6% to $3.0 billion in 2022 from $591.0 million in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $19.2 million.
The increase in total revenues was due to our return of operations, with our full fleet in service by June 2022, compared to 2021 when we began resuming guest cruise operations. Occupancy in 2022 was 85.1% compared to 49.3% in 2021.
Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $331.9 million in 2022 and $72.0 million in 2021.
Cruise Operating Expenses
Total Cruise operating expenses increased by $4.0 billion, or 148.9%, to $6.6 billion in 2022 from $2.7 billion in 2021.
The increase in Cruise operating expenses was driven by the return to operations in 2022, with the majority of our fleet in service compared to 2021, when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect. The 2022 operating expenses include the overhead costs associated with bringing our ships back to service and our crew back on board our ships. Additionally, inflationary pressures have impacted our operating costs, especially in fuel and food expense. Our cost of fuel (net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements) for 2022 increased 43% per metric ton compared to 2021 mainly due to the increase in fuel price.
Marketing, Selling and Administrative Expenses
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased $0.2 billion, or 15.5% to $1.6 billion in 2022 from $1.4 billion in 2021. The increase was due to the ramp up of our global sales and marketing efforts starting in the second half of 2021 as we commenced our resumption of operations. Additionally, having our full fleet in service as of June 30, 2022 increased overall expenses compared to 2021.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $0.1 billion, or 8.8%, to $1.4 billion in 2022 compared to $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to the addition of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond to our fleet in January 2022 and April 2022, respectively, and depreciation for Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn, which were delivered in March 2021 and November 2021, respectively.
.Impairment and Credit Losses
Impairment and credit losses for 2022 was $0.6 million compared to $82.0 million in 2021. The decrease in impairment loss was primarily due to 2021 impairment charges of certain construction in progress projects that were reduced in scope or terminated as a result of COVID-19, which did not recur in 2022.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased $72.4 million, or 5.6%, to $1.4 billion in 2022 from $1.3 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to additional indebtedness associated with new ship deliveries.

Equity investment income for 2022 was $56.7 million compared to Equity investment Loss of $135.5 million in 2021. The increase in income was primarily due to income from TUI Cruises, one of our equity investments, in 2022 compared to losses in 2021.

44

Other (expense) income decreased $140.7 million, or 693.5%, to other expense of $120.4 million in 2022 from other income of $20.3 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a loss contingency of $130.0 million recorded in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation.
Other Comprehensive Income
Other comprehensive income in 2022 was $67.7 million compared to $28.5 million in 2021. The change was primarily due to Changes in defined benefits plan in 2022 of $48.9 million compared to $8.7 million in 2021.

Future Application of Accounting Standards
Refer to Note. 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities increased by $2.4 billion to cash provided of $0.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $1.9 billion for the same period in 2021. Our full resumption of operations in 2022 generated an increase in guest ticket and onboard collections for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a partial resumption of operations in 2021.
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $843.0 million to cash used of $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $2.1 billion for the same period in 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures of $480.4 million due to the increased cost associated with taking delivery of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond in 2022 compared to taking delivery of Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn in 2021, and an increase in cash paid on settlement of derivative financial instruments of $281.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to cash provided of $3.0 billion in 2021. The decrease of $1.3 billion was primarily attributable to proceeds from common stock issuances of $1.6 billion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022, and offset by repayments of commercial paper notes of $414.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022.

Future Capital Commitments
Capital Expenditures
Our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December 31, 2022, we have one Oasis-class ship, and three ships of a new generation, known as our Icon-class, on order for our Royal Caribbean International brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 22,500 berths. As of December 31, 2022, we have one Edge-class ship on order for our Celebrity Cruises brand, with a capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we have two ships on order for our Silversea Cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths. Refer to Item 1. Business-Operations for further information on our ships on order. We have committed financing arrangements in place covering 80% of the cost of the ship for the seven ships on order for our Global Brands, all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Additionally, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l’Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing.
As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, excluding any ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $9.8 billion, of which we had deposited $832 million. Approximately 52.3% of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments and Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
We have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted on our cash flows, liquidity and financial position by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to preserve liquidity, we deferred a significant portion of our planned 2020, 2021 and 2022 capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2022, we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures, based on our existing ships on order, will be approximately $4.1 billion for 2023. This amount does not include any ships on order by our Partner Brands.

(1)    Long-term debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2037 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates. Interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, using the applicable rate at December 31, 2022. Debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at December 31, 2022.
(2)     Amounts are based on contractual installment and delivery dates for our ships on order. Included in these figures are $5.7 billion in final contractual installments, which have committed financing covering 80% of the cost of the ships on order for our Global Brands, almost all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion or any agreements entered for ships on order that remain contingent upon completion of conditions precedent.
Refer to Note 8. Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for maturities related to debt.
Refer to Note 9. Leases to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for maturities related to lease liabilities.
Refer to Funding Needs and Sources below for discussion on the planned funding of the above material contractual obligations.
As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships. We continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these were to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.
Refer to Note 7. Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for ownership restrictions related to TUI Cruises.
Refer to Note 8. Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for export credit agency guarantees.
Refer to Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for other agreements.
As of December 31, 2022, other than the items described above, we are not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial position.

Funding Needs and Sources
Historically, we relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, draw-downs under our available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional debt and/or the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations. COVID-19 resulted in our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations from March 2020 up to our full fleet returning to service during the second quarter of 2022. The suspension of operations strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity, causing us to take actions resulting in reductions in our operating expenses, reductions in our capital expenses and new financings and other liquidity actions.
The Company continually identifies and evaluates actions to maintain adequate liquidity. These include, and are not limited to: further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings. Additionally, we will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. Actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities.
We have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $7.6 billion of committed financing for our ships on order.
As of December 31, 2022, our obligations due through December 31, 2023 primarily consisted of $2.1 billion related to debt maturities, $1.3 billion related to interest on debt and $2.7 billion related to progress payments on our ship orders and, based on expected delivery date, the final installments payable due upon the delivery of Silver Nova, Icon of the Seas, and Celebrity Ascent.
As of December 31, 2022, we had liquidity of $2.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion, $0.3 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, and a $0.7 billion commitment for a 364-day term loan facility which was terminated in February 2023 in connection with our completion of the $700 million 7.25% Priority Guaranteed Notes offering. Our revolving credit facilities were partially utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities as of December 31, 2022, which were subsequently amended in January 2023, as described in Note 8. Debt to our consolidated financial statements. We have agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases unless we repay the remaining principal payments that were deferred under our export credit facilities in 2020 and 2021. Refer to Note 10. Shareholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.
If any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.
Based on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. However, there is no assurance that our assumptions and estimates are accurate as there is inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict future liquidity requirements. Refer to Note 1. General, Management’s Plan and Liquidity, to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.

Debt Covenants
Our export credit facilities, our non-export credit facilities, and certain of our credit card processing agreements contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio, limit our net debt-to-capital ratio, and maintain minimum liquidity, and under certain facilities, to maintain a minimum level of stockholders' equity. The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters. Our minimum stockholders' equity and maximum net debt-to-capital calculations exclude the impact of Accumulated other comprehensive loss on Total stockholders' equity. In 2021 and 2022, the financial covenant levels were modified for 2023 and 2024. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with our financial covenants and we estimate that we will be in compliance for at least the next twelve months.

48

Any further covenant waivers may lead to increased costs, increased interest rates, additional restrictive covenants and other available lender protections as may be agreed with our lenders. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers in a timely manner, or on acceptable terms. If we require additional waivers and are not able to obtain them or repay the debt facilities, this would lead to an event of default and potential acceleration of amounts due under all of our outstanding debt and derivative contracts. Refer to Note 8. Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding debt covenants.

Dividends
The declaration of dividends shall at all times be subject to the final determination of our board of directors that a dividend is prudent at that time in consideration of the needs of the business. In the event we declare a dividend or engage in share repurchases, we will need to repay the amounts deferred under our export credit facilities. Accordingly, we have not declared a dividend since the first quarter of 2020.

("Ahern Rentals"), which is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. (5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix.

(7)Reflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see "Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net" below. EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations. EBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The net income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company's results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity u...

If any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.
Based on our assumptions and estimates and our financial condition, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements.

Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021
In this section, references to 2022 refer to the year ended December 31, 2022 and references to 2021 refer to the year ended December 31, 2021.
Revenues
Total revenues increased $7.3 billion, or 477.0%, to $8.8 billion in 2022 from $1.5 billion in 2021.
Passenger ticket revenues comprised 65.5% of our 2022 total revenues. Passenger ticket revenues increased by $4.9 billion, or 515.6% to $5.8 billion in 2022 from $0.9 billion in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $129.8 million.
The remaining 34.5% of total revenues was comprised of Onboard and other revenues, which increased $2.5 billion, or 415.6% to $3.0 billion in 2022 from $591.0 million in 2021 and was partially offset by unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $19.2 million.
The increase in total revenues was due to our return of operations, with our full fleet in service by June 2022, compared to 2021 when we began resuming guest cruise operations. Occupancy in 2022 was 85.1% compared to 49.3% in 2021.
Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $331.9 million in 2022 and $72.0 million in 2021.
Cruise Operating Expenses
Total Cruise operating expenses increased by $4.0 billion, or 148.9%, to $6.6 billion in 2022 from $2.7 billion in 2021.
The increase in Cruise operating expenses was driven by the return to operations in 2022, with the majority of our fleet in service compared to 2021, when the suspension of our global cruise operations was in effect. The 2022 operating expenses include the overhead costs associated with bringing our ships back to service and our crew back on board our ships. Additionally, inflationary pressures have impacted our operating costs, especially in fuel and food expense. Our cost of fuel (net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements) for 2022 increased 43% per metric ton compared to 2021 mainly due to the increase in fuel price.
Marketing, Selling and Administrative Expenses
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased $0.2 billion, or 15.5% to $1.6 billion in 2022 from $1.4 billion in 2021. The increase was due to the ramp up of our global sales and marketing efforts starting in the second half of 2021 as we commenced our resumption of operations. Additionally, having our full fleet in service as of June 30, 2022 increased overall expenses compared to 2021.
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses
Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $0.1 billion, or 8.8%, to $1.4 billion in 2022 compared to $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to the addition of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond to our fleet in January 2022 and April 2022, respectively, and depreciation for Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn, which were delivered in March 2021 and November 2021, respectively.
.Impairment and Credit Losses
Impairment and credit losses for 2022 was $0.6 million compared to $82.0 million in 2021. The decrease in impairment loss was primarily due to 2021 impairment charges of certain construction in progress projects that were reduced in scope or terminated as a result of COVID-19, which did not recur in 2022.
Other Income (Expense)
Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased $72.4 million, or 5.6%, to $1.4 billion in 2022 from $1.3 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to additional indebtedness associated with new ship deliveries.

Equity investment income for 2022 was $56.7 million compared to Equity investment Loss of $135.5 million in 2021. The increase in income was primarily due to income from TUI Cruises, one of our equity investments, in 2022 compared to losses in 2021.

44

Other (expense) income decreased $140.7 million, or 693.5%, to other expense of $120.4 million in 2022 from other income of $20.3 million in 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a loss contingency of $130.0 million recorded in connection with the ongoing Havana Docks litigation.
Other Comprehensive Income
Other comprehensive income in 2022 was $67.7 million compared to $28.5 million in 2021. The change was primarily due to Changes in defined benefits plan in 2022 of $48.9 million compared to $8.7 million in 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash
Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities increased by $2.4 billion to cash provided of $0.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $1.9 billion for the same period in 2021. Our full resumption of operations in 2022 generated an increase in guest ticket and onboard collections for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, compared to a partial resumption of operations in 2021.
Net cash used in investing activities increased by $843.0 million to cash used of $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to cash used of $2.1 billion for the same period in 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures of $480.4 million due to the increased cost associated with taking delivery of Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond in 2022 compared to taking delivery of Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn in 2021, and an increase in cash paid on settlement of derivative financial instruments of $281.7 million in 2022 compared to 2021.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to cash provided of $3.0 billion in 2021. The decrease of $1.3 billion was primarily attributable to proceeds from common stock issuances of $1.6 billion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022, and offset by repayments of commercial paper notes of $414.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, compared to none during the same period in 2022.

Future Capital Commitments
Capital Expenditures
Our future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December 31, 2022, we have one Oasis-class ship, and three ships of a new generation, known as our Icon-class, on order for our Royal Caribbean International brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 22,500 berths. As of December 31, 2022, we have one Edge-class ship on order for our Celebrity Cruises brand, with a capacity of approximately 3,250 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, we have two ships on order for our Silversea Cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,460 berths. Refer to Item 1. Business-Operations for further information on our ships on order. We have committed financing arrangements in place covering 80% of the cost of the ship for the seven ships on order for our Global Brands, all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Additionally, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l’Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing.
As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, excluding any ships on order by our Partner Brands, was approximately $9.8 billion, of which we had deposited $832 million. Approximately 52.3% of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 16. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments and Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
We have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted on our cash flows, liquidity and financial position by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to preserve liquidity, we deferred a significant portion of our planned 2020, 2021 and 2022 capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2022, we anticipate overall full year capital expenditures, based on our existing ships on order, will be approximately $4.1 billion for 2023. This amount does not include any ships on order by our Partner Brands.

(1)    Long-term debt obligations mature at various dates through fiscal year 2037 and bear interest at fixed and variable rates. Interest on variable-rate debt is calculated based on forecasted debt balances, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, using the applicable rate at December 31, 2022. Debt denominated in other currencies is calculated based on the applicable exchange rate at December 31, 2022.
(2)     Amounts are based on contractual installment and delivery dates for our ships on order. Included in these figures are $5.7 billion in final contractual installments, which have committed financing covering 80% of the cost of the ships on order for our Global Brands, almost all of which include sovereign financing guarantees. Amounts do not include potential obligations which remain subject to cancellation at our sole discretion or any agreements entered for ships on order that remain contingent upon completion of conditions precedent.
Refer to Note 8. Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for maturities related to debt.
Refer to Note 9. Leases to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for maturities related to lease liabilities.
Refer to Funding Needs and Sources below for discussion on the planned funding of the above material contractual obligations.
As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships. We continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these were to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

Funding Needs and Sources
Historically, we relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, draw-downs under our available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional debt and/or the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund our obligations. COVID-19 resulted in our voluntary suspension of global cruise operations from March 2020 up to our full fleet returning to service during the second quarter of 2022. The suspension of operations strained our sources of cash flow and liquidity, causing us to take actions resulting in reductions in our operating expenses, reductions in our capital expenses and new financings and other liquidity actions.
The Company continually identifies and evaluates actions to maintain adequate liquidity. These include, and are not limited to: further reductions in capital expenditures, operating expenses and administrative costs and additional financings. Additionally, we will continue to pursue various opportunities to raise additional capital to fund obligations associated with future debt maturities and/or to extend the maturity dates associated with our existing indebtedness or facilities. Actions to raise capital may include issuances of debt, convertible debt or equity in private or public transactions or entering into new or extended credit facilities.
We have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $7.6 billion of committed financing for our ships on order.
As of December 31, 2022, our obligations due through December 31, 2023 primarily consisted of $2.1 billion related to debt maturities, $1.3 billion related to interest on debt and $2.7 billion related to progress payments on our ship orders and, based on expected delivery date, the final installments payable due upon the delivery of Silver Nova, Icon of the Seas, and Celebrity Ascent.
As of December 31, 2022, we had liquidity of $2.9 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 billion, $0.3 billion of undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, and a $0.7 billion commitment for a 364-day term loan facility which was terminated in February 2023 in connection with our completion of the $700 million 7.25% Priority Guaranteed Notes offering. Our revolving credit facilities were partially utilized through a combination of amounts drawn and letters of credit issued under the facilities as of December 31, 2022, which were subsequently amended in January 2023, as described in Note 8. Debt to our consolidated financial statements. We have agreed with certain of our lenders not to pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases unless we repay the remaining principal payments that were deferred under our export credit facilities in 2020 and 2021. Refer to Note 10. Shareholders']:
Note 9. Leases We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements mostly for certain of our offices, data centers, colocations, and land. We have also entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements mostly for certain network infrastructure. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2023 and 2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The components of lease costs are as follows (in millions): ----------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ----- ---- ----- ----- - ----- Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 380 $ 344 $ 259 Interest 16 15 14 Operating lease cost 1,857 1,540 1,391 Variable lease cost and other, net 363 272 269 Total lease cost $ 2,616 $ 2,171 $ 1,933 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded $1.71 billion impairment loss for operating lease ROU assets as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts.
