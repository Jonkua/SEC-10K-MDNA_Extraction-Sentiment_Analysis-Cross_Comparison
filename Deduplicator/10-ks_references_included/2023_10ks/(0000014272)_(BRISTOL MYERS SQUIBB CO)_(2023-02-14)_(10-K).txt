Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this 2022 Form 10-K to enhance the understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The comparison of 2021 to 2020 results has been omitted from this Form 10-K and is incorporated by reference from our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” filed on February 10, 2021.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a global biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this 2022 Form 10-K for definitions of capitalized terms used throughout the document.

In 2022, we obtained 18 approvals for new medicines and additional indications and formulations of currently marketed medicines in major markets (the U.S., EU and Japan), including advancement in oncology through FDA and EC approval of Opdualag, the first PD-1 inhibitor and LAG-3 blocking antibody combination. Additionally, in the U.S., EU and Japan, two Opdivo based regimens as first-line treatments for unresectable advanced or metastatic ESCC were approved. We continue to advance and invest in our cell therapy portfolio through the approval of Abecma in Japan for the treatment of multiple myeloma for patients with at least three prior therapies, and approvals of Breyanzi for the relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with second-line treatments in the U.S. and Japan, and third-line treatments in the EU. We continue the expansion of our cell therapy manufacturing capabilities at our existing facilities in Washington and New Jersey, as well as through the construction of new state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts and in Leiden, Netherlands. The approvals for Sotyktu (deucravacitinib) in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis expanded our portfolio in immunology. Within cardiovascular, we broadened our New Product Portfolio with the FDA approval of Camzyos (mavacamten) for patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM. In addition, in August 2022, we acquired Turning Point, a precision oncology company, with the goal of expanding our solid tumor portfolio with the addition of repotrectinib.

In 2022, our revenues remained consistent with the prior year due to growth in our In-Line Products (primarily Eliquis and Opdivo) and New Product Portfolio (primarily Opdualag, Abecma and Reblozyl), offset by Recent LOE Products (primarily Revlimid) and the impact of foreign exchange. The $0.17 decrease in GAAP EPS in 2022 was primarily due to changes to equity investment and contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by lower impairment charges and weighted-average common shares outstanding. After adjusting for specified items, non-GAAP EPS increased $0.54 as a result of lower weighted-average common shares outstanding and Acquired IPRD charges and higher royalties and licensing income.

Economic and Market Factors

Governmental Actions

Our products continue to be subject to increasing pressures across the portfolio from pharmaceutical market access and pricing controls and discounting, changes to tax and importation laws and other restrictions in the U.S., the EU and other regions around the world that result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and smaller populations for whom payers will reimburse, which can negatively impact our results of operations (including intangible asset impairment charges), operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the IRA which provides for (i) the government to negotiate prices for select high-cost Medicare Part D (beginning in 2026) and Part B drugs (beginning in 2028) that are more than nine years (for small-molecule drugs) or 13 years (for biological products) from their FDA approval, (ii) manufacturers to pay a rebate for Medicare Part B and Part D drugs when prices increase faster than inflation beginning in 2022 for Part D and 2023 for Part B, and (iii) Medicare Part D redesign which replaces the current coverage gap provisions and establishes a $2,000 cap for out-of-pocket limits costs for Medicare beneficiaries beginning in 2025, with manufacturers being responsible for 10% of costs up to the $2,000 cap and 20% after that cap is reached. Implementation of this legislation is expected to be carried out through upcoming actions by regulatory authorities, the outcome of which is uncertain. Additionally, in connection with the IRA the following changes have been made to U.S. tax laws, including (i) a 15% minimum tax that generally applies to U.S. corporations on adjusted financial statement income beginning in 2023 and (ii) a non-deductible 1% excise tax provision on net stock repurchases, to be applied to repurchases beginning in 2023. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA legislation on our results of operations and it is possible that these changes may result in a material impact on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, countries are expected to make changes to their tax laws and updates to international tax treaties to implement the agreement by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to establish a global minimum tax. See risk factors on these items included under “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Product, Industry and Operational Risks—Increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins” and “—Changes to tax regulations could negatively impact our earnings.”

COVID-19

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities took a number of actions to limit the spread of COVID-19 and address related disruptions in the U.S. and global economy. As the COVID-19 pandemic affected global healthcare systems as well as major economic and financial markets, we adopted several procedures focused on ensuring the continued supply of our medicines to our patients and protecting the health, wellbeing and safety of our workforce. While the pandemic has not significantly impacted our results of operations, the situation remains dynamic and it is difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the negative impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Strategy

Our principal strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a large pharmaceutical company with the speed, agility and focus on innovation typically found in the biotech industry. Our priorities are to continue to renew and diversify our portfolio through launching new medicines, advancing our early, mid and late-stage pipeline, and executing disciplined business development. We remain committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating and returning capital to shareholders.

Our focus is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines for patients facing serious diseases in the following core therapeutic areas: (i) oncology with a priority in certain tumor types; (ii) hematology with opportunities to broaden our franchise and sustain a leadership position in multiple myeloma; (iii) immunology with priorities in relapsing multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, RA and inflammatory bowel disease; (iv) cardiovascular disease (v) fibrotic disease with priorities in lung and liver, and (vi) neuroscience with a focus on neurodegenerative disease.

We continue to advance the next wave of innovative medicines by investing significantly in our oncology, hematology (with alnuctamab in multiple myeloma), immunology (with LPA1 antagonist in pulmonary fibrosis) and cardiovascular portfolios with our alliance partnership with Janssen where we are advancing a next-generation antithrombotic medicine milvexian. We have expanded our oncology portfolio, including a precision oncology asset repotrectinib in ROS-1 mutated NSCLC. For hematology, there is a broad effort to continue addressing the unmet medical needs in multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and anemia (e.g., MDS and MF associated anemia) and we are working across multiple modalities and mechanisms of action such as cereblon modulators (“CELMoDs”), ADCs, T-cell Engagers and CAR-T therapies. For immunology, the Phase III clinical trials are underway for cendakimab in eosinophilic esophagitis.

Our commercial model has been successful with revenues from our in-line brands and new product portfolio continuing to grow, which demonstrates strong execution of our strategy. In 2022, we have launched three first-in-class medicines with blockbuster potential across three therapeutic areas: Opdualag in first line melanoma, Camzyos in oHCM, Sotyktu in moderate to severe psoriasis. We remain focused and well-resourced in our cancer development programs and seek to broaden the use of Opdivo in earlier lines of therapy, expand into new tumors, accelerate next wave oncology mechanisms and develop treatment options for refractory oncology patients. We are further strengthening our IO portfolio with Opdualag for the treatment of melanoma and potential expanded opportunities in lung, liver, CRC and adjuvant melanoma. We continue to drive adoption of Opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents. Eliquis continues to grow, leveraging its best in class clinical profile and extensive real world data and is now the number one novel oral anticoagulant in total prescriptions globally. In immunology, the Phase III registrational clinical trials are underway for Sotyktu in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and psoriatic arthritis. We are able to leverage our leading capabilities in hematological malignancies and our robust pipeline to provide opportunities for long-term growth to offset the impact of current and future patent expires for Revlimid and Pomalyst.

We expect the growth of our in-line and new product portfolio will enable us to more than offset the expected decline in Revlimid, Abraxane and other products revenues due to their loss of market exclusivity through 2025.

The evolution in our operating model, which focuses on maintaining a disciplined approach in marketing, selling and administrative expenses, will enable us to deliver the necessary strategic, financial and operational flexibility to invest in the highest priority opportunities within our portfolio. Through our Celgene acquisition restructuring activities, we realized at least $3.0 billion of synergies annually resulting from cost savings and avoidance. The achieved synergies were across general and administrative, manufacturing, R&D, and procurement, and also resulted in streamlining the Company's pricing and information technology infrastructure.

Our strategy extends well beyond the discovery, development and delivery of transformative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. We believe that driving long-term business value is at the heart of living our purpose, from improving access and affordability to advancing inclusion and diversity and health equity in all areas of medicine to supporting a healthy planet in order to sustain lives and communities everywhere. Our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy is integrated into our company’s core strategy, as the opportunities and potential impacts of ESG issues are directly connected to our business. Our ESG strategy focuses on (i) operating with effective governance and the highest ethical standards, and seeking transparency and dialogue with our stakeholders to improve our understanding of their needs, (ii) fostering an environment of inclusion and belonging and build a globally diverse workforce to drive equitable advancement and outcomes for all, (iii) around the globe, improve access to our innovative therapies and promote health equity to improve health outcomes for populations disproportionately affected by serious diseases and (iv) understand our responsibility to create a maximum positive impact while minimizing our environmental footprint while leveraging sustainability to drive innovation, build resiliency and manage nonfinancial risks.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Regional Revenues

The composition of the changes in revenues was as follows:

------------------- ----------------------- ------------- ---- ------ -------- ------ ------------------- - - --- - --- -
 Year Ended December 31, 2022 vs. 2021
Dollars in Millions 2022 2021 % Change Foreign Exchange(b)
United States $ 31,828 $ 29,214 9 % —

Other(a) 834 852 (2) % —
Total $ 46,159 $ 46,385 — (3) %

(a)    Other revenues include royalties and alliance-related revenues for products not sold by our regional commercial organizations.
(b)    Foreign exchange impacts were derived by applying the prior period average currency rates to the current period revenues.

United States

•U.S. revenues in 2022 increased primarily due to Eliquis, New Product Portfolio, and Opdivo, partially offset by our Recent LOE Products. Average net selling prices increased by 4% in 2022 compared to the same period a year ago.

International

•International revenues in 2022 decreased primarily due to lower demand for Revlimid as a result of generic erosion, foreign exchange and lower average net selling prices, partially offset by In-Line Products and New Product Portfolio.

No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of total revenues in 2022 and 2021. Our business is typically not seasonal.

GTN Adjustments

We recognize revenue net of GTN adjustments that are further described in “—Critical Accounting Policies.”

The activities and ending reserve balances for each significant category of GTN adjustments were as follows:

-------------------------------------- ------------------------------- --- ----------------------------- -------- ------------------------------------------------- ----- ------- - -------- - -----
 Year Ended December 31, 2022

The reconciliation of gross product sales to net product sales by each significant category of GTN adjustments was as follows:

------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ -------- -------- - ------ ------------- --- - --- -
 Year Ended December 31, % Change
Dollars in Millions 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021
Gross product sales $ 69,633 $ 67,897 3 %
GTN Adjustments
Charge-backs and cash discounts (7,469) (7,253) 3 %
Medicaid and Medicare rebates (11,362) (9,374) 21 %
Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments (6,131) (6,215) (1) %
Total GTN Adjustments (24,962) (22,842) 9 %
Net product sales $ 44,671 $ 45,055 (1) %

GTN adjustments percentage 36 % 33 % 3 %
U.S. 41 % 40 % 1 %
Non-U.S. 17 % 17 % —

Reductions to provisions for product sales made in prior periods resulting from changes in estimates were $229 million and $319 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The reductions to provisions in 2022 primarily related to Non-U.S. revisions in clawback amounts primarily driven by the VAT recoverable estimates in 2022 and Eliquis coverage gap discounts in 2021. GTN adjustments are primarily a function of product sales volume, regional and payer channel mix, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates. U.S. GTN adjustments percentage increased primarily due to higher government channel mix, which has higher GTN adjustment percentages.

** Change in excess of 100%.
(a) Recent LOE Products include products with significant decline in revenue from a prior reporting period as a result of a loss of exclusivity.

Eliquis (apixaban) — an oral Factor Xa inhibitor, indicated for the reduction in risk of stroke/systemic embolism in NVAF and for the treatment of DVT/PE and reduction in risk of recurrence following initial therapy.

•U.S. revenues increased 21% in 2022 due to higher demand and higher average net selling prices, including favorable GTN adjustments.

•International revenues decreased 7% in 2022 primarily due to foreign exchange impacts of 11% and lower average net selling prices, partially offset by higher demand. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 4%.

•Following the May 2021 expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Eliquis in Europe, and court decisions in (i) the United Kingdom finding the UK apixaban composition of matter patent and related SPC invalid and (ii) the Netherlands denying a BMS request for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented an at-risk generic launch, generic manufacturers have begun marketing generic versions of Eliquis in the UK and the Netherlands, and may seek to market generic versions of Eliquis in additional countries in Europe, prior to the expiration of our patents, which may lead to additional infringement and invalidity actions involving our Eliquis patents being filed in various countries in Europe. We believe in the innovative science behind Eliquis and the strength of our intellectual property, which we will defend against infringement. Refer to “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies—Intellectual Property” for further information.

43

Opdivo (nivolumab) — a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 on T and NKT cells that has been approved for several anti-cancer indications including bladder, blood, CRC, head and neck, RCC, HCC, lung, melanoma, MPM, stomach and esophageal cancer. The Opdivo+Yervoy regimen also is approved in multiple markets for the treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, MPM, RCC, CRC and various gastric and esophageal cancers. There are several ongoing potentially registrational studies for Opdivo across other tumor types and disease areas, in monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and various anti-cancer agents.

•U.S. revenues increased 15% in 2022 due to higher demand across multiple indications including the Opdivo+Yervoy combinations for NSCLC, Opdivo+Cabometyx* combination for kidney cancer, bladder and various gastric and esophageal cancers, partially offset by declining second-line eligibility across tumor indications and increased competition.

•International revenues increased 3% in 2022 due to higher demand partially offset by foreign exchange impacts of 11% and lower average net selling prices. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 14%.

Pomalyst/Imnovid (pomalidomide) — a proprietary, distinct, small molecule that is administered orally and modulates the immune system and other biologically important targets. Pomalyst/Imnovid is indicated for patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and have demonstrated disease progression on or within 60 days of completion of the last therapy.

•U.S. revenues increased 8% in 2022 due to higher average net selling prices and higher demand.

•International revenues decreased 2% in 2022 due to foreign exchange impacts of 10% and lower average net selling prices, partially offset by higher demand. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 8%.

Orencia (abatacept) — a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe active RA and PsA and is also indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in certain pediatric patients with moderately to severely active polyarticular JIA.

•U.S. revenues increased 9% in 2022 due to higher demand.

•International revenues decreased 8% in 2022 due to foreign exchange impacts of 11%, partially offset by higher demand. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 3%.

•In the U.S. and EU, estimated minimum market exclusivity dates were previously based on method of use patents that expired in 2021. Formulation and additional patents expire in 2026 and beyond. There are no Orencia biosimilars on the market in the U.S., EU or Japan.

Sprycel (dasatinib) — an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic phase and the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including Gleevec* (imatinib mesylate) and the treatment of children and adolescents aged 1 year to 18 years with chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML.

•U.S. revenues increased 15% in 2022 due to higher average net selling prices and higher demand.

•International revenues decreased 19% in 2022 due to foreign exchange impacts of 11% and lower demand as a result of generic erosion. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues decreased by 8%.

Yervoy (ipilimumab) — a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The Opdivo+Yervoy regimen also is approved in multiple markets for the treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, MPM, RCC, CRC and esophageal cancer.

•U.S. revenues increased 3% in 2022 due to higher average net selling prices.

•International revenues increased 9% in 2022 due to higher demand as a result of additional indication launches and core indications, partially offset by foreign exchange impacts of 12% and lower average net selling prices. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, revenues increased by 21%.

Empliciti (elotuzumab) — a humanized monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

44

Estimated End-User Demand

Pursuant to the SEC Consent Order described under “—SEC Consent Order”, we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. There were no products in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel with estimated levels of inventory in excess of one month as of December 31, 2022 (U.S.) and September 30, 2022 (outside of the U.S.).

In the U.S., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 78% of total gross sales of U.S. products for the year ended December 31, 2022. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic erosion, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.

Camzyos is only available through a restricted program called the Camzyos REMS Program. Product distribution is limited to REMS certified pharmacies, and enrolled pharmacies must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Camzyos. Revlimid and Pomalyst are distributed in the U.S. primarily through contracted pharmacies under the Lenalidomide REMS and Pomalyst REMS programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of Revlimid and Pomalyst. Internationally, Revlimid and Imnovid are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities’ specifications to provide for the products’ safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies.

Our non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data, including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2022 is not available prior to the filing of this 2022 Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

** Change in excess of 100%.
(a)    Excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets.

Cost of products sold

Cost of products sold include material, internal labor and overhead costs from our owned manufacturing sites, third-party product supply costs and other supply chain costs managed by our global manufacturing and supply organization. Cost of products sold also includes royalties and profit sharing, certain excise taxes, foreign currency hedge settlement gains and losses and impairment charges. Cost of products sold typically varies between periods as a result of volume, product mix (particularly royalties and profit sharing), foreign exchange, as well as changes in price, inflation, costs attributed to manufacturing site exits and impairment charges. Cost of products sold excludes amortization from acquired intangible assets.

Cost of products sold increased by $197 million primarily driven by product mix including higher profit sharing due to Eliquis revenue growth ($541 million), higher manufacturing startup costs and inventory related charges primarily from expanding our CAR-T cell therapy capabilities, partially offset by foreign exchange and related hedging settlements ($588 million) and impairment charges related to Inrebic EU regulatory approval milestones in 2021 ($315 million).

Marketing, selling and administrative

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs, advertising and product promotion costs. Expenses are managed through regional commercialization organizations or global enabling functions such as finance, legal, information technology and human resources. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements.

Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased by $124 million primarily due to higher charitable giving ($235 million) and the cash settlement of Turning Point unvested stock awards ($73 million), partially offset by foreign exchange.

Research and development

Research and development activities include research and early discovery, preclinical and clinical development, drug formulation and medical support of marketed products. Expenses include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, IPRD impairment charges and proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs. The allocations include facilities, information technology, employee stock compensation costs and other appropriate costs. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Expenses typically vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of IPRD impairment charges.

Research and development expense decreased by $686 million primarily due to lower IPRD impairment charges ($742 million), partially offset by the cash settlement of Turning Point unvested stock awards in 2022 ($80 million). Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for further information on impairment charges.

Acquired IPRD

Acquired IPRD expenses are comprised of upfront payments, contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or in-license arrangements of third-party intellectual property rights, as well as any upfront and contingent milestones payable by BMS to alliance partners prior to regulatory approval. Acquired IPRD charges are detailed in the table below.

Amortization of Acquired Intangible Assets

Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by $428 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to a change in the expected expiration of the market exclusivity period for Pomalyst to the first quarter of 2026 and the expiration of Abraxane market exclusivity in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Other (income)/expense, net

Other (income)/expense, net changed by $1.3 billion in 2022, primarily due to equity investments, contingent value rights and other items discussed below.

•Interest expense decreased in 2022 due to additional debt maturities. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10. "Financing Arrangements” for further information.
•Royalties increased in 2022 primarily due to higher Keytruda* and diabetes business divestiture royalties. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements” for further information.
•Equity investments generated losses in 2022 compared to income in 2021 due to fair value adjustments for investments that have readily determinable fair value, observable price changes for investments without readily determinable fair values resulting primarily from initial public offerings or third-party acquisitions of entities which we held an ownership interest, and changes in limited partnership net asset values. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements” for more information.
•Integration expenses decreased in 2022 due to lower consulting fees to implement Celgene integration initiatives related to processes and systems.
•Loss on debt redemption resulted from the early redemption of long-term debt of $6.0 billion in 2022 and $3.5 billion in 2021.
•Divestiture gains resulted from certain mature product rights divested in 2022.
•Investment income increased in 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates.
•Litigation and other settlements includes amounts related to commercial disputes regarding licensing and supply obligation matters, intellectual property and promotional practice matters. In addition, 2022 includes income of $40 million resulting from a settlement resolving all legal claims and business interests pertaining to Nimbus’ TYK2 inhibitor. The settlement also provides for contingent development, regulatory and sales-based milestones payable to BMS upon the occurrence of certain events. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies."
•Provision for restructuring includes exit and other costs primarily related to the Celgene Acquisition Plan. We have achieved at least $3.0 billion in annual synergies related to the Celgene Acquisition Plan. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6. Restructuring” for further information.
•Contingent consideration primarily includes fair value adjustments resulting from the change in the traded price of contingent value rights issued with the Celgene acquisition. The contractual obligation to pay the contingent value rights terminated in January 2021 because the FDA did not approve liso-cel (JCAR017) by December 31, 2020.
•Other includes foreign exchange losses of $83 million in 2022 and $15 million in 2021 (net of hedging), exit costs of $39 million resulting from the transition of our commercial operations in the Russian Federation to a third-party distributor and Turning Point acquisition costs of $32 million in 2022.

Income Taxes

-------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ----- - -----
 Year Ended December 31,
Dollars in Millions 2022 2021
Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 7,713 $ 8,098
Provision for Income Taxes 1,368 1,084
Effective Tax Rate 17.7 % 13.4 %

Impact of Specified Items (2.4) % 2.6 %
Effective Tax Rate Excluding Specified Items 15.3 % 16.0 %

The income tax impact attributed to the GAAP effective tax rate includes the impact from specified items summarized in the following “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section. Income tax impact of specified items was primarily due to low jurisdictional tax rates attributed to intangible asset amortization in both periods, IPRD impairment charges and non-taxable contingent value rights fair value adjustments in 2021, a revaluation in 2021 (and to a lesser extent 2022) of the basis of intangible and other assets internally transferred to streamline our legal entity structure after the Celgene acquisition, and tax reserve releases related to the 2009 Mead Johnson split-off transaction in 2022.

The 0.7% decrease in the effective tax rate excluding specified items during 2022 primarily resulted from releases of income tax reserves of $297 million for tax positions that were effectively settled for the BMS 2008 to 2012 tax years (excluding Mead Johnson related amounts that were specified) and the lapse of statute of limitations for the Celgene 2012 to 2016 tax years, partially offset by jurisdictional earnings mix. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7. Income Taxes” for additional information.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded from non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information because the Company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods, including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, (v) accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, (vi) divestiture gains or losses, (vii) stock compensation resulting from acquisition-related equity awards, (viii) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (ix) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments (including fair value adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments) and (x) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from release of income tax reserves related to the Mead Johnson split-off transaction and internal transfers of intangible and other assets to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the Celgene acquisition. We also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We calculate foreign exchange impacts by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior period average currency rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in Exhibit 99.2 to our Form 8-K filed on February 2, 2023 and are incorporated herein by reference.

Beginning with the first quarter of 2022, significant R&D charges or other income resulting from upfront or contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or licensing of third-party intellectual property rights are no longer excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. We made these changes to our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures following comments from and discussions with the SEC. For purposes of comparability, the non-GAAP financial measures for the year ended December 31, 2021, have been updated to reflect this change.

Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors’ overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be the same as or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We regularly assess our anticipated working capital needs, debt and leverage ratio levels, debt maturities, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions in order to maximize shareholder return, efficiently finance our ongoing operations and maintain flexibility for future strategic transactions. We also regularly evaluate our capital structure to ensure financial risks, adequate liquidity access and lower cost of capital are efficiently managed, which may lead to the issuance of additional debt securities, the repurchase of debt securities prior to maturity or the issuance or repurchase of common stock. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, research and development costs are required to be capitalized and amortized effective January 1, 2022, which resulted in an increase of approximately $1.9 billion in U.S. tax payments in 2022 as compared to 2021.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities together with cash generated from operations in the next few years, and, if required, from the issuance of commercial paper, will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital, income taxes, restructuring initiatives, business development and acquisitions, repurchase of common stock, debt maturities of approximately $10.6 billion through 2026, as well as any debt repurchases through redemptions or tender offers. As of December 31, 2022, our net debt position increased by $2.5 billion primarily due to common stock repurchases and dividends ($12.6 billion) and the Turning Point acquisition ($3.3 billion), partially offset by cash from operating activities ($13.1 billion).

We have a share repurchase program, authorized by our Board of Directors, allowing for repurchases of BMS common stock shares, effected in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares nor does it have a specific expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In 2022, we repurchased approximately 109 million shares of our common stock for $8.0 billion, including approximately 69 million shares for $5.0 billion through our ASR program. The remaining share repurchase capacity under the share repurchase program was $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 17. Equity” for additional information.

Dividend payments were $4.6 billion in 2022 and $4.4 billion in 2021. Dividend paid per common share was $0.54 during each quarter of 2022. Dividends are authorized on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors.

Under our commercial paper program, we may issue a maximum of $5.0 billion unsecured notes that have maturities of not more than 366 days from the date of issuance. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2022.

In 2022, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion and repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion primarily to modify our future debt maturities. In addition, $4.8 billion of debt matured and was repaid. Refer to “Item 1. Financial Statements—Note 10. Financing Arrangements” for further information.

As of December 31, 2022, we had a five-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in January 2027, which is extendable annually by one year with the consent of the lenders. This facility provides for customary terms and conditions with no financial covenants and may be used to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings. No borrowings were outstanding under any revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022 or 2021.

52

Our investment portfolio includes marketable debt securities, which are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. Our investment policy establishes limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10. Financing Arrangements for further information.

Capital Expenditures

Annual capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion in 2022, $970 million in 2021 and $750 million in 2020 and are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion in 2023 and 2024. We continue to make capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our cell therapy and other manufacturing capabilities, research and development and other facility-related activities.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations relating to debt, income taxes and lease arrangements are provided in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards”, “—Note 10. Financing Arrangements”, “—Note 7. Income Taxes” and “—Note 14. Leases”, respectively.

We are committed to an aggregate $22.0 billion of potential contingent future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $7.5 billion (milestones achieved through Phase III clinical studies) and late-stage milestones of $14.5 billion (milestones achieved post Phase III clinical studies). Payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. Certain agreements also provide for sales-based milestones aggregating to $17.5 billion that we would be obligated to pay upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. We also have certain manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of these obligations. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3. Alliances” and "—Note 4. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Licensing and Other Arrangements" for further information.

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Credit Ratings

Our current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s Investors Service are A2 and Prime-1, respectively, with a stable long-term credit outlook, and our current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor’s are A+ and A-1, respectively with a stable long-term credit outlook. The long-term ratings reflect the agencies’ opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. The short-term ratings reflect the agencies’ opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. Any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally.

Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. As a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.

The $3.1 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2021 was driven by higher tax payments ($1.9 billion) primarily resulting from research and development expenses that are capitalized and amortized for tax purposes, Turning Point acquisition-related payments ($300 million), higher upfront research and early discovery payments ($250 million), as well as timing of cash collections and timing of vendor payments in the ordinary course of business.

Investing Activities

Cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties), the sale and maturity of marketable securities, sale of equity investments, as well as upfront and contingent milestones payments from licensing arrangements.

The $524 million change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2021 was primarily due to the acquisition of Turning Point ($3.2 billion, net of cash acquired), lower proceeds from the sale of equity investments ($2.4 billion), partially offset by the changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held ($4.1 billion), lower Acquired IPRD payments ($646 million) and higher proceeds from divestitures ($557 million).

Financing Activities

Cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.

The $738 million change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock ($1.7 billion), partially offset by changes in the amount of net debt borrowings ($871 million).

SEC Consent Order

As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.

Under the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.

We have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.

We maintain DSAs with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross U.S. revenues. Under the current terms of the DSAs, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. The three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 78% of our gross U.S. revenues. The inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. business’s wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, our non-U.S. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.

We believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

For recently issued accounting standards, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards.”

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. Revenue is recognized following a five-step model: (i) identify the customer contract; (ii) identify the contract’s performance obligation; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and (v) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is also reduced for GTN sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience.

The following categories of GTN adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2. Revenue” for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of GTN sales adjustments.

Charge-backs and cash discounts

Our U.S. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).

In the U.S. and certain other countries, customers are offered cash discounts as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the invoiced sales price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of cash discount at the time of sale and the discount is typically taken by the customer within one month.

Medicaid and Medicare rebates

Our U.S. business participates in state government Medicaid programs and other qualifying Federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. All discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual. Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed Medicaid plans. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.

55

Rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. managing prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit. We also pay a 70% point of service discount to the CMS when the Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the coverage gap. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.

Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments

Other GTN sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-U.S. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. to a lesser extent. The non-U.S. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.

Estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of market exclusivity. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.

Use of information from external sources

Information from external sources is used to estimate GTN adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.

We have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.

Acquisition and Intangible Assets Valuations

We make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities and assets. If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business. Our assessments concluded that the Turning Point transaction was a business combination in 2022 and the MyoKardia transaction in 2020 was an asset acquisition.

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions.

In transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPRD projects at the acquisition date are expensed unless there is an alternative future use. In addition, product development milestones are expensed upon achievement.

We have identifiable intangible assets that are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Generally, we engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. The fair value of these assets is estimated using discounted cash flow models. These models required the use of the following significant estimates and assumptions among others:

56

•Identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;
•Estimates of revenues and operating profits related to commercial products or product candidates;
•Eligible patients, pricing and market share used in estimating future revenues;
•Probability of success for unapproved product candidates and additional indications for commercial products;
•Resources required to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
•Timing of regulatory approvals and exclusivity;
•Appropriate discount rate by products;
•Market participant income tax rates; and
•Allocation of expected synergies to products.

We believe the fair value used to record intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions considering the facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date.

Impairment and Amortization of Long-lived Assets, including Intangible Assets

Long-lived assets include intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable or at least annually for IPRD. Intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include changes in competitive landscape, earlier than expected loss of market exclusivity, pricing reductions, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval for initial or follow on indications and unanticipated development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. If the carrying value of long-lived assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written-down to its fair value. Expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. The estimated useful lives of long-lived assets is subjective and requires significant judgment regarding patent lives, future plans and external market factors. Long-lived assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of depreciation or amortization. Impairment charges included in Cost of products sold and Research and development expense were $101 million in 2022, $1.2 billion in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2020. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for further discussion and analysis of these impairment charges.

Income Taxes

Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $4.1 billion at December 31, 2022 (net of valuation allowance of $873 million) and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2021 (net of valuation allowance of $1.1 billion).

The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $709 million at December 31, 2022. These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2023. The foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2023 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).

Prior to the Mead Johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and (iii) conversion of Mead Johnson & Company to a limited liability company. These transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal opinions.

Certain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. For example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value.

57

In addition, a negative basis or excess loss account (“ELA”) existed in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA. The tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the Internal Revenue Service could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of Mead Johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009. In December 2022, we have determined this position to be effectively settled and have released the related reserves.

We agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the initial public offering and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO. Mead Johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead Johnson’s stock or assets.

Liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.

For discussions on income taxes, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards—Income Taxes” and “—Note 7. Income Taxes.”

Contingencies

In the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. We recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.

For discussions on contingencies, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards—Contingencies,” “—Note 7. Income Taxes” and “—Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.”

Product and Pipeline Developments

Our R&D programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. Our late stage R&D programs in Phase III development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and additional indications or formulations for marketed products. Spending on these programs represents approximately 40% of our annual R&D expenses in the last three years. Opdivo was the only investigational compound or marketed product that represented greater than 10% of our R&D expenses in the last three years. Our late-stage development programs could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years if regulatory approvals are obtained and products are successfully commercialized. The following are the late-stage new indication developments in our marketed products, as well as developments in our late-stage pipeline through February 2, 2023:

Breyanzi Lymphoma January 2023 Announced positive topline results from the Phase II portion of the TRANSCEND CLL 004, a Phase I/II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study evaluating Breyanzi in adults with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma. The study met the primary endpoint of complete response rate compared to historical control.
December 2022 Announced Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approval of Breyanzi for use in the second-line treatment of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, regardless of whether autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is intended. The approval is based on the results of clinical trials in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma after first-line therapy, including global Phase III clinical trials (JCAR017-BCM-003) in patients intended for autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, Phase II clinical trials (017006) in the United States (U.S.) in patients not intended for autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, and cohort 2 of Phase II clinical trials (JCAR017-BCM-001) in Europe and Japan.
June 2022 Announced FDA approval of Breyanzi for the second-line treatment of adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified high-grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma grade 3B who have: refractory disease to first line chemoimmunotherapy or relapsed within 12 months of first-line chemoimmunotherapy; or refractory disease to first-line chemoimmunotherapy or relapse after first-line chemoimmunotherapy and are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant due to comorbidities or age. The approval is based on results from the Phase II PILOT and Phase III TRANSFORM trials.
June 2022 Announced that the EMA validated its Type II Variation application for extension of the indication for Breyanzi in second-line treatment of adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high grade B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma grade 3B, who are refractory or have relapsed within 12 months of initial therapy and are candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The application is based on the Phase III TRANSFORM study.
April 2022 Announced EC approval of Breyanzi for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma grade 3B after two or more lines of systemic therapy. The approval is based on results from the TRANSCEND WORLD and TRANSCEND NHL 001 trials.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This 2022 Form 10-K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as “should,” “could,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “target,” “may,” “project,” “guidance,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and projections about our future financial results, goals, plans and objectives and involve inherent risks, assumptions and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years, and could cause our future financial results, goals, plans and objectives to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the statements. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and objectives regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products, our business development strategy and in relation to our ability to realize the projected benefits of our acquisitions of Celgene, MyoKardia, and Turning Point, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the development and commercialization of our products, potential laws and regulations to lower drug prices, market actions taken by private and government payers to manage drug utilization and contain costs, the expiration of patents or data protection on certain products, including assumptions about our ability to retain marketing exclusivity of certain products, and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this 2022 Form 10-K, particularly under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.

Although we believe that we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. Additional risks that we may currently deem immaterial or that are not presently known to us could also cause the forward-looking events discussed in this 2022 Form 10-K not to occur. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise after the date of this 2022 Form 10-K.

•Provision for restructuring includes exit and other costs primarily related to the Celgene Acquisition Plan. We have achieved at least $3.0 billion in annual synergies related to the Celgene Acquisition Plan. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6. Restructuring” for further information.
•Contingent consideration primarily includes fair value adjustments resulting from the change in the traded price of contingent value rights issued with the Celgene acquisition. The contractual obligation to pay the contingent value rights terminated in January 2021 because the FDA did not approve liso-cel (JCAR017) by December 31, 2020.

 Year Ended December 31,
Dollars in Millions 2022 2021
Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 7,713 $ 8,098
Provision for Income Taxes 1,368 1,084
Effective Tax Rate 17.7 % 13.4 %

Impact of Specified Items (2.4) % 2.6 %
Effective Tax Rate Excluding Specified Items 15.3 % 16.0 %

The income tax impact attributed to the GAAP effective tax rate includes the impact from specified items summarized in the following “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section. Income tax impact of specified items was primarily due to low jurisdictional tax rates attributed to intangible asset amortization in both periods, IPRD impairment charges and non-taxable contingent value rights fair value adjustments in 2021, a revaluation in 2021 (and to a lesser extent 2022) of the basis of intangible and other assets internally transferred to streamline our legal entity structure after the Celgene acquisition, and tax reserve releases related to the 2009 Mead Johnson split-off transaction in 2022.

The 0.7% decrease in the effective tax rate excluding specified items during 2022 primarily resulted from releases of income tax reserves of $297 million for tax positions that were effectively settled for the BMS 2008 to 2012 tax years (excluding Mead Johnson related amounts that were specified) and the lapse of statute of limitations for the Celgene 2012 to 2016 tax years, partially offset by jurisdictional earnings mix. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 7. Income Taxes” for additional information.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Our non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of past or future operating results. These items are excluded from non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information because the Company believes they neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company']:
NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill. The table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total identifiable intangible assets acquired and net liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 7, 2021. --------------------------------------- ------ ----- --------------------...

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our financial condition or results of operations.

Credit Ratings

Our current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s Investors Service are A2 and Prime-1, respectively, with a stable long-term credit outlook, and our current long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor’s are A+ and A-1, respectively with a stable long-term credit outlook. The long-term ratings reflect the agencies’ opinion that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. The short-term ratings reflect the agencies’ opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. Any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally.

Cash Flows

The following is a discussion of cash flow activities:

-------------------------------- ----------------------- ------ ---- -------- - ------
 Year Ended December 31,
Dollars in Millions 2022 2021
Cash flow provided by/(used in):
Operating activities $ 13,066 $ 16,207
Investing activities (1,062) (538)
Financing activities (16,962) (16,224)

53

Operating Activities

Cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized in our results of operations. As a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners; payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business.

The $3.1 billion change in cash flow from operating activities compared to 2021 was driven by higher tax payments ($1.9 billion) primarily resulting from research and development expenses that are capitalized and amortized for tax purposes, Turning Point acquisition-related payments ($300 million), higher upfront research and early discovery payments ($250 million), as well as timing of cash collections and timing of vendor payments in the ordinary course of business.

Investing Activities

Cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable securities with original maturities greater than 90 days at the time of purchase, proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties), the sale and maturity of marketable securities, sale of equity investments, as well as upfront and contingent milestones payments from licensing arrangements.

The $524 million change in cash flow from investing activities compared to 2021 was primarily due to the acquisition of Turning Point ($3.2 billion, net of cash acquired), lower proceeds from the sale of equity investments ($2.4 billion), partially offset by the changes in the amount of marketable debt securities held ($4.1 billion), lower Acquired IPRD payments ($646 million) and higher proceeds from divestitures ($557 million).

Financing Activities

Cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings, as well as proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.

The $738 million change in cash flow from financing activities compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock ($1.7 billion), partially offset by changes in the amount of net debt borrowings ($871 million).

SEC Consent Order

As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004.

Under the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process.

We have established a company-wide policy concerning our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent, which includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.

We maintain DSAs with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross U.S. revenues. Under the current terms of the DSAs, our wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. The three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 78% of our gross U.S. revenues. The inventory information received from our wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. business’s wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, our non-U.S. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.

We believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

For recently issued accounting standards, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards.”

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. Revenue is recognized following a five-step model: (i) identify the customer contract; (ii) identify the contract’s performance obligation; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation; and (v) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. Revenue is also reduced for GTN sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Estimates are assessed each period and adjusted as required to revise information or actual experience.

The following categories of GTN adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2. Revenue” for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of GTN sales adjustments.

Charge-backs and cash discounts

Our U.S. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).

In the U.S. and certain other countries, customers are offered cash discounts as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the invoiced sales price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of cash discount at the time of sale and the discount is typically taken by the customer within one month.

Medicaid and Medicare rebates

Our U.S. business participates in state government Medicaid programs and other qualifying Federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates to participating state and local government entities. All discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual. Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed Medicaid plans. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.

55

Rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. managing prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit. We also pay a 70% point of service discount to the CMS when the Medicare Part D beneficiaries are in the coverage gap. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.

Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments

Other GTN sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-U.S. countries as well as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. to a lesser extent. The non-U.S. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.

Estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of market exclusivity. Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line, similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model and estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.

Use of information from external sources

Information from external sources is used to estimate GTN adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers is based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.

We have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.

Acquisition and Intangible Assets Valuations

We make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities and assets. If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business. Our assessments concluded that the Turning Point transaction was a business combination in 2022 and the MyoKardia transaction in 2020 was an asset acquisition.

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions.

In transactions accounted for as acquisitions of assets, no goodwill is recorded and contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to IPRD projects at the acquisition date are expensed unless there is an alternative future use. In addition, product development milestones are expensed upon achievement.

We have identifiable intangible assets that are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. Generally, we engage an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. The fair value of these assets is estimated using discounted cash flow models. These models required the use of the following significant estimates and assumptions among others:

56

•Identification of product candidates with sufficient substance requiring separate recognition;
•Estimates of revenues and operating profits related to commercial products or product candidates;
•Eligible patients, pricing and market share used in estimating future revenues;
•Probability of success for unapproved product candidates and additional indications for commercial products;
•Resources required to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
•Timing of regulatory approvals and exclusivity;
•Appropriate discount rate by products;
•Market participant income tax rates; and
•Allocation of expected synergies to products.

We believe the fair value used to record intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions considering the facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date.

Impairment and Amortization of Long-lived Assets, including Intangible Assets

Long-lived assets include intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable or at least annually for IPRD. Intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include changes in competitive landscape, earlier than expected loss of market exclusivity, pricing reductions, adverse regulatory changes or clinical study results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval for initial or follow on indications and unanticipated development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies resulting from cost savings and avoidance, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation. If the carrying value of long-lived assets exceeds its fair value, then the asset is written-down to its fair value. Expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. The estimated useful lives of long-lived assets is subjective and requires significant judgment regarding patent lives, future plans and external market factors. Long-lived assets are also periodically reviewed for changes in facts or circumstances resulting in a reduction to the estimated useful life of the asset, requiring the acceleration of depreciation or amortization. Impairment charges included in Cost of products sold and Research and development expense were $101 million in 2022, $1.2 billion in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2020. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for further discussion and analysis of these impairment charges.

Income Taxes

Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were $4.1 billion at December 31, 2022 (net of valuation allowance of $873 million) and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2021 (net of valuation allowance of $1.1 billion).

The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards were $709 million at December 31, 2022. These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2023. The foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2023 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).

Prior to the Mead Johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and (iii) conversion of Mead Johnson & Company to a limited liability company. These transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal opinions.

Certain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could affect the tax treatment of the exchange. For example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value.

57

In addition, a negative basis or excess loss account (“ELA”) existed in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA. The tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the Internal Revenue Service could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of Mead Johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009. In December 2022, we have determined this position to be effectively settled and have released the related reserves.

We agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the initial public offering and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO. Mead Johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead Johnson’s stock or assets.

Liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses.

Contingencies

In the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. We recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.

For discussions on contingencies, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1. Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards—Contingencies,” “—Note 7. Income Taxes” and “—Note 20. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.”

Product and Pipeline Developments

Our R&D programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support future growth. Our late stage R&D programs in Phase III development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and additional indications or formulations for marketed products. Spending on these programs represents approximately 40% of our annual R&D expenses in the last three years. Opdivo was the only investigational compound or marketed product that represented greater than 10% of our R&D expenses in the last three years. Our late-stage development programs could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years if regulatory approvals are obtained and products are successfully commercialized. The following are the late-stage new indication developments in our marketed products, as well as developments in our late-stage pipeline through February 2, 2023:

No new safety signals were observed.
March 2022 Announced that the Phase III PIVOT IO-001 trial did not meet the primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) in patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic melanoma who were treated with bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo compared to Opdivo monotherapy. The DMC notified the companies that the third primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) did not meet statistical significance at the first interim analysis. The trial was conducted in collaboration with Nektar. The trial will be unblinded and no additional analyses for the OS endpoint will be performed.Based on subsequent results from pre-planned analyses of two late-stage clinical studies in RCC and bladder cancer, coupled with the results of PIVOT IO-001 noted above, BMS and Nektar have jointly decided to end the global clinical development program for bempegaldesleukin in combination with Opdivo.
