Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Management’s Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that are reasonably likely to affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report and includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” (immediately prior to Part I) and Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered.
•United States – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States; and
•International – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.

Executive Overview
 We are an independent exploration and production company, focused on U.S. resource plays: Eagle Ford in Texas, Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Permian in New Mexico and Texas. Our U.S. assets are complemented by our international operations in E.G. Our overall business strategy is to responsibly deliver competitive corporate return levels, free cash flow and cash returns to shareholders, all of which are sustainable and resilient through long-term commodity price cycles. We expect to achieve our business strategy by adherence to a disciplined reinvestment rate capital allocation framework that limits our capital expenditures relative to our expected cash flow from operations. Keeping our workforce safe, maintaining a strong balance sheet, responsibly meeting global energy demand with a focus on continuously improving environmental performance, serving as a trusted partner in our local communities and maintaining best in-class corporate governance standards are foundational to the execution of our strategy.
Compared to the prior year, we experienced a significant increase in revenues, income from operations and operating cash flow, all of which were driven by higher commodity prices. Total company net sales volumes were roughly flat for 2022 when compared to 2021. Our cash generated from operations during 2022 more than funded our capital program, dividend payments and share repurchases. Our acquisition of the assets and certain related liabilities of Ensign Natural Resources in the Eagle Ford resource play in Texas (discussed below) was funded using cash on hand and incremental debt. These results and activities are consistent with our prioritization of free cash flow generation and adherence to our disciplined capital allocation framework.
Key 2022 highlights include:
Improved financial results
•Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.4 billion in 2022 as compared to $3.2 billion in 2021.
•Our net income was $3.6 billion in 2022 as compared to net income of $946 million in 2021. Included in our financial results:
◦Revenues from contracts with customers increased $1.9 billion compared to 2021 as realized commodity prices were significantly higher.
◦Income from our equity method investments totaled $613 million, which was an increase of $360 million compared to 2021, due to higher realized prices.
◦We recorded a net loss on commodity derivatives of $114 million, as compared to a net loss of $383 million in 2021, which increased income by $269 million.
◦Production expense increased $156 million compared to 2021 as a result of higher workover activity and inflationary pressures on labor, fuel, chemicals and services.
◦As a result of higher income before taxes, our provision for income taxes increased by $109 million compared to 2021. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the increase in income taxes.
Prioritized return of capital to investors and maintained investment grade balance sheet
•During 2022, we repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of shares through our share repurchase program.
•Paid $220 million of dividends, or $0.32 per share, during 2022, compared to dividends paid of $0.18 per share during 2021.
•As of December 31, 2022, we have $334 million in cash and $2.4 billion of total liquidity.

Table of Contents
•All three primary credit ratings agencies continue to rate us as investment grade subsequent to our acquisition of additional acreage in the Eagle Ford (see below).
Eagle Ford resource play acquisition
•In December 2022, we closed on a transaction to acquire approximately 130,000 net proved and unproved acres, with an average 97% working interest, from Ensign Natural Resources for cash consideration of $3.0 billion, which was subject to customary closing adjustments.
•Acquired acreage nearly doubles our net acreage position in the Eagle Ford, increasing our inventory of undrilled locations.
ESG highlights and initiatives
•Continued to execute on a combination of near-term (2023), medium-term (2025) and longer-term (2030) goals covering GHG emissions intensity, methane intensity, natural gas capture and zero routine flaring.
•Released a Human Rights Policy covering our global operations to further acknowledge our longstanding commitment to the dignity and rights of all people.
•Continued Board of Directors refreshment through appointment of two new directors.

Outlook
In February 2023, we announced a 2023 capital budget of $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion that prioritizes free cash flow generation over production growth, consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework.

Market Conditions
Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, redemption of our debt, payment of dividends and funding of share repurchases. Following the initial COVID outbreak in 2020, commodity prices steadily increased due to rising oil demand as global economic activity recovered. However, more recently in 2022, commodity prices have experienced significant volatility due to geopolitical events, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and demand impacts tied to macroeconomic conditions from global inflation. Price volatility was also exacerbated by ongoing OPEC+ petroleum supply limitations, COVID related impacts, strategic petroleum reserve releases and economic sanctions involving producer countries. We continue to expect commodity price volatility given the complex global dynamics of supply and demand that exist in the market. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition – Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion on how volatility in commodity prices could impact us.

Crude oil and condensate – Alba field liquids production is primarily condensate. We generally sell our share of condensate in relation to the Brent crude benchmark. Alba Plant LLC processes the rich hydrocarbon gas which is supplied by the Alba field under a fixed-price long term contract. Alba Plant LLC extracts NGLs and condensate which is then sold by Alba Plant LLC at market prices, with our share of the revenue reflected in income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income. Alba Plant LLC delivers the processed dry natural gas to the Alba Unit Parties for distribution and sale to AMPCO and EG LNG.
Natural gas liquids – Wet gas is sold to Alba Plant LLC at a fixed-price long term contract resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. Alba Plant LLC extracts and keeps NGLs, which are sold at market price, with our share of income from Alba Plant LLC being reflected in the income from equity method investments on the consolidated statements of income.

Table of Contents
Natural gas – Dry natural gas, processed by Alba Plant LLC on behalf of the Alba Unit Parties, is sold by the Alba field to EG LNG and AMPCO at fixed-price contracts resulting in realized prices not tracking market price. The gas sales contracts between Alba Unit and EG LNG and AMPCO expire on December 31, 2023 and in 2026, respectively. We derive additional value from the equity investment in our downstream gas processing units EG LNG and AMPCO. EG LNG sells LNG on a market-based contract and AMPCO markets methanol at market prices. We are progressing new LNG agreements expected to be effective on January 1, 2024, and our intention is to secure increased exposure to global LNG market prices. Alba Plant LLC and EG LNG process third-party gas from the Alen field under a combination of a tolling and a market linked profit-sharing arrangement, the benefits of which are included in our respective share of income from equity method investees. This profit-sharing arrangement provides exposure to global LNG market prices.

Net loss on commodity derivatives in 2022 was $114 million compared to $383 million in 2021. We have commodity derivative contracts that settle against various indices. We record commodity derivative gains/losses as the index pricing and forward curves change each period. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
Income from equity method investments increased $360 million in 2022 from 2021. Our investees benefited from higher price realizations in 2022, partially offset by lower volumes.
Production expenses increased $156 million during 2022 from 2021, primarily as a result of the U.S. segment’s higher workover activity and inflationary pressures on labor, fuel, chemicals and services.

International $ 65 $ 54 20 % $ 3.04 $ 2.45 24 %

 Exploration expenses include unproved property impairments, dry well costs, geological and geophysical and other costs. The $26 million decrease in exploration expenses in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by lower impairment of unproved property leases. See Note 6 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.

Geological and geophysical 1 5 (80) %
Other 8 6 33 %
Total exploration expenses $ 110 $ 136 (19) %

Depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased $313 million in 2022 from 2021, primarily as a result of lower DD&A (expense per boe) rate impacted by field-level changes in reserves. In addition, the DD&A rate is impacted by capitalized costs and the sales volume mix between fields.
Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, including capitalized asset retirement costs; therefore volumes have an impact on DD&A expense. The following table provides DD&A expense and DD&A expense rates for each segment:

International $ 60 $ 68 (12) % $ 2.82 $ 3.07 (8) %

 Impairments decreased $53 million in 2022 from 2021. Impairments in 2021 included $30 million impairment related to an increase in the estimated future decommissioning costs of certain non-producing wells, pipelines and production facilities for previously divested offshore assets located in the Gulf of Mexico and a $24 million impairment as we decommissioned certain Eagle Ford central facilities. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impairments in further detail.
Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes, primarily in the U.S., which tend to increase or decrease in relation to revenue and sales volumes. Taxes other than income increased $139 million in 2022 from 2021 period primarily due to higher price realizations in the U.S. segment in 2022.
General and administrative expenses increased $17 million in 2022 from 2021. The higher costs in 2022 include transaction fees associated with our acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign Natural Resources during the fourth quarter of 2022.
Loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased to nil in 2022 as compared to $121 million in 2021 due to make-whole call provisions paid upon redemption of our $500 million 2022 Notes in the second quarter of 2021 and our $900 million 2025 Notes in the third quarter of 2021. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.
Provision for income taxes reflects an effective rate of 4% in 2022 as compared to 6% in 2021. The 2022 effective tax rate includes a deferred tax benefit of $685 million from the first quarter release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets. In 2021, we had a full valuation allowance on net federal deferred tax assets, which resulted in no federal tax expense on U.S. operations. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.

Segment Results: 2022 compared to 2021
Segment Income
Segment income represents income that excludes certain items not allocated to our operating segments, net of income taxes. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding items not allocated to the operating segments.
The following table reconciles segment income to net income.

---------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ----- ---- ----- - -----

International 585 317
Segment income 3,325 1,594
Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes 287 (648)
Net income $ 3,612 $ 946

 United States segment income in 2022 was $2.7 billion of income versus $1.3 billion of income in 2021. The increase in income was primarily due to higher price realizations and lower DD&A expenses. These favorable changes were partially offset by higher income taxes, production expenses and production taxes in 2022.
 International segment income in 2022 was $585 million of income versus $317 million of income in 2021. The increase in income was primarily due to higher prices realized by our equity method investees, partially offset by higher incomes taxes.
Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes in 2022 was income of $287 million of income versus a loss of $648 million for the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily due to the first quarter 2022 release of the valuation allowance on certain U.S. and state deferred tax assets resulting in a deferred tax benefit of $685 million. In addition, the prior year included $121 million of debt extinguishment costs.

Consolidated Results of Operations: 2021 compared to 2020
A detailed discussion of the year-over-year changes from the year ended December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2020 can be found in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and is available via the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.marathonoil.com.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity
Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows, the amount of capital we invest in our business, principal debt repayments, payment of dividends and funding of share repurchases. We generated significant positive cash flow from operations during 2022. We continue to expect volatility in commodity prices and that could impact the amount of cash flow from operations we generate.
As previously discussed in the Outlook section, our capital budget for 2023 is $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion. Our top priorities for using cash provided by operations are to fund our capital budget and return capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, and service our outstanding debt. We believe our current liquidity level, cash flow from operations and ability to access the capital markets provides us with the flexibility to fund our business across a wide range of commodity price environments.

Sources of cash and cash equivalents
Cash flows generated from operating activities in 2022 were 68% higher compared to 2021, primarily as a result of higher realized commodity prices. The increase was partially offset by higher production expense, primarily as a result of the U.S. segment’s higher workover activity and inflationary pressures on labor, fuel, chemicals and services during 2022. Additionally, taxes other than income increased compared to 2021 primarily due to higher price realizations in the U.S. segment in 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, we had $1.5 billion in borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and $450 million in borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below for further information.
Uses of cash and cash equivalents
On November 2, 2022, we executed a definitive purchase agreement to acquire the assets and certain related liabilities of Ensign Natural Resources in the Eagle Ford resource play in Texas. The transaction was closed on December 27, 2022, for cash consideration of $3.0 billion, which was subject to customary closing adjustments. We funded the acquisition using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility. We believe the transaction will be accretive to our financial metrics while increasing our scale in the Eagle Ford by adding high working interest acreage to our inventory portfolio that is located adjacent to our existing position. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased our ownership interest in operated Eagle Ford resource play acreage for cash consideration of approximately $135 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2022 acquisitions.
During the year ended 2022, we repurchased 113 million shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program at a cost of $2.8 billion, paid dividends of $220 million and redeemed the $32 million 9.375% Senior Notes on the maturity date. Additionally, we repurchased $22 million of shares related to our tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of employee restricted stock awards and restricted stock units; these repurchases do not impact our share repurchase program authorization.

Total use of cash and cash equivalents for property, plant and equipment $ 1,450 $ 1,046

The increase in our capital expenditures for the U.S. segment in 2022 compared to 2021 largely reflects inflationary pressures related to oil field services, labor, drilling materials and equipment.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Capital Resources and Available Liquidity
Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, capital market transactions and our Revolving Credit Facility. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2.4 billion of liquidity consisting of $334 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.1 billion available under our Revolving Credit Facility.
Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and our Revolving Credit Facility. We may draw on our Revolving Credit Facility to meet short-term cash requirements or issue debt or equity securities through the shelf registration statement discussed below as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, dividends and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of how our commitments and contingencies could affect our available liquidity. General economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business and other factors could affect our operations and our ability to access the capital markets.
We maintain investment grade ratings at all three primary credit rating agencies. A downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our future cost of financing or limit our ability to access capital and could result in additional credit support requirements. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of how a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us.
We may incur additional debt in order to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions or development activities or for general corporate or other purposes. A higher level of indebtedness could increase the risk that our liquidity and financial flexibility deteriorates. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how our level of indebtedness could affect us.

On November 22, 2022, we entered into a two-year $1.5 billion Term Loan Facility and borrowed the full amount thereunder on December 27, 2022. The Term Loan Facility can be prepaid without penalty.
On July 28, 2022, we executed the seventh amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility. The primary changes to the Revolving Credit Facility effected by this amendment were to (i) extend the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility by three years to July 28, 2027, (ii) decrease the size of the Revolving Credit Facility from $3.1 billion to $2.5 billion, (iii) replace the LIBOR interest rate benchmark with SOFR and (iv) implement certain revisions to the Pricing Schedule. As of December 31, 2022, we have borrowed $450 million under our Revolving Credit Facility.
Both our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility include a covenant requiring that our total debt to total capitalization ratio not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our total debt-to-capital ratio was 26% at December 31, 2022.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17 for further information related to the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility.

Other Sources of Liquidity
We have an effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC pursuant to which we, as a “well-known seasoned issuer” for purposes of SEC rules, subject to market conditions, are permitted to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt, equity securities and other capital instruments, if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune, in one or more public offerings.
Capital Requirements
Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other potential or expected obligations:
Capital Spending
Our approved capital budget for 2023 is $1.9 billion to $2.0 billion. Additional details were previously discussed in Outlook.
Debt
As of December 31, 2022, we had $5.9 billion of total long-term debt outstanding, of which $402 million is due within the next year. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17 for a listing of our long-term debt maturities.
Anticipated cash payments for interest related to our fixed-rate debt in future periods are $190 million for 2023, $340 million for 2024-2025, $322 million for 2026-2027 and $1.1 billion for the remaining years for a total of $2.0 billion.
As a result of the increase in debt incurred arising from the acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign Natural Resources in December 2022, we expect interest expense in 2023, and cash payments thereon, to be materially higher as compared to 2022. Assuming interest rates in effect at December 31, 2022, and repayments at scheduled maturities, anticipated cash payments for interest related to our floating-rate debt in future periods are $119 million for 2023, $146 million for 2024-2025 and $42 million for 2026-2027. As noted above, the Term Loan Facility can be prepaid without penalty.
Share Repurchase Program
Effective November 2, 2022, our Board of Directors increased our remaining share repurchase program authorization to $2.5 billion. The total remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $2.5 billion at December 31, 2022.
Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately $133 million of shares of our common stock through February 15, 2023.
Leases
For future lease obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.
Dividends
On January 25, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022. The dividend is payable on March 10, 2023, to shareholders of record on February 15, 2023.
Pension and Postretirement Plans
Estimated cash payments for our pension and other postretirement benefits plans in future periods are $33 million for 2023, $60 million for 2024-2025, $53 million for 2026-2027 and $125 million for the remaining years for a total of $271 million.
Income Taxes
As described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the IRA was signed into law during 2022 and we are awaiting further guidance from the U.S. Treasury regarding the calculation of minimum income tax liabilities. We continue to assess whether or not we expect to have a minimum income tax liability. If we conclude that we do trigger the minimum income tax, we may have to make estimated tax payments.

Transactions with Related Parties
Offshore E.G., we own a 64% working interest in the Alba Unit. Onshore E.G., we own a 52% interest in an LPG processing plant, a 56% interest in an LNG production facility and a 45% interest in a methanol production plant, each through equity method investees. We sell our natural gas from the Alba Unit to these equity method investees as the feedstock for their production processes.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements for December 31, 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies
We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately offset by the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation of hazardous waste disposal sites. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance.
We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.
New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future on both state and federal levels. We strive to comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but as not all costs are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.
For more information on environmental regulations, litigation and contingencies that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business – Environmental, Health and Safety Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 25.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.
Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves
We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities. The successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves. The amount of estimated proved reserve volumes affect, among other things, whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed, the amount and timing of costs depreciated, depleted or amortized into net income and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities. In addition, the expected future cash flows to be generated by producing properties are used for testing impairment and the expected future taxable income available to realize deferred tax assets, also in part, rely on estimates of quantities of net reserves. Refer to the applicable sections below for further discussion of these accounting estimates.
The estimation of quantities of net reserves is a highly technical process performed by petroleum engineers and geoscientists for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, which is based upon several underlying assumptions. The reserve estimates may change as additional information becomes available and as contractual, operational, economic and political conditions change. We evaluate our reserves using drilling results, reservoir performance, subsurface interpretation and future plans to develop acreage. Technologies used in proved reserves estimation includes statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, pressure gradient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves. As per SEC requirements, proved undeveloped reserve volumes are limited to activity in the 5-year plan and wells that will be developed within 5 years of initial booking. The data for a given reservoir may also change over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity and future development costs, production history and continual reassessment of the viability of future production volumes under varying economic conditions.
Reserve estimates are based on an unweighted average of commodity prices in the prior 12-month period using the closing prices on the first day of each month, as defined by the SEC. The table below provides the 2022 SEC pricing for certain benchmark prices:

--------------------------------- ---------------- ------
 2022 SEC Pricing
WTI crude oil (per bbl) $ 93.67
Henry Hub natural gas (per mmbtu) $ 6.36
Brent crude oil (per bbl) $ 100.25
Mont Belvieu NGLs (per bbl) $ 36.59

When determining the December 31, 2022, proved reserves for each property, the benchmark prices listed above were adjusted using price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences.
If the future average commodity prices are below the average prices used to determine proved reserves at December 31, 2022, it could have an adverse effect on our estimates of proved reserve volumes and the value of our business. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in capital funding, drilling plans and governmental regulation, among other things. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential price change and the effect on proved reserves, due to numerous factors. For further discussion of risks associated with our estimation of proved reserves, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Fair Value Estimates
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.
The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
•Level 2 – Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.
•Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.
Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.
Significant uses of fair value measurements include:
•assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination;
•impairment assessments of long-lived assets;
•impairment assessments of equity method investments;
•impairment assessments of goodwill;
•recorded value of derivative instruments; and
•recorded value of pension plan assets.
The need to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, sustained declines in our common stock, reductions to our capital budget, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the property is located.

Table of Contents
Assets and Liabilities Acquired in a Business Combination
In accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. If applicable, any excess of the purchase price over the fair value is recorded as goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values allocated to proved and unproved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas properties. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party valuation experts for assistance, including the 2022 Ensign acquisition.
The fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method, which requires us to estimate reserves as described above under Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves, project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. Significant assumptions include:
•Future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas realized prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, governmental policies and vehicle stocks. There has been significant volatility in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on commodity prices.
•Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Such quantities are based on a combination of risk-adjusted reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on reserves.
•Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineering studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews.
•Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.
•Future operating and development costs. Our estimates of future operating & development costs are based upon a combination of authorized spending and internal forecasts.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our 2022 acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Ensign Natural Resources, which was accounted for as a business combination.
Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets in use are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of an impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure or contractual terms that cause economic interdependency amongst separate, discrete fields. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value.
Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions are consistent with those discussed in the Assets and Liabilities Acquired in a Business Combination section above.

48

Table of Contents
We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions in our undiscounted cash flow calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pace and timing of development plans, commodity prices, capital expenditures, operating costs, drilling and development costs, inflation and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future undiscounted cash flows would likely be partially offset by lower costs.
During 2022, we recorded impairment charges totaling $72 million related to proved and unproved properties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairments recorded in 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the related fair value measurements.
Impairment Assessment of Equity Method Investments
Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value may have occurred. When a loss is deemed to have occurred that is other than temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value.
Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our equity method investees for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions and the performance of entities that we do not control. Significant assumptions include:
•Future condensate, NGL, LNG, natural gas and methanol prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on our analysis of market supply and demand and consideration of market price indicators. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by global market supply and demand. To estimate supply, we consider numerous factors, including the worldwide resource base, depletion rates and OPEC production policies. We believe demand is largely driven by global economic factors, such as population and income growth, and governmental policies. There has been significant volatility in commodity prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise.
•Estimated quantities of feedstock condensate, NGLs and natural gas processed by our investees. There are two primary sets of inputs used to estimate feedstock volumes processed by our investees. The first input involves hydrocarbons produced from our Alba field. Our equity method investees currently process hydrocarbons from our Alba field, which consists of condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserves. Estimated quantities of hydrocarbons processed from our Alba field are based on a combination of proved reserves and risk-weighted probable reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. The second input involves our estimate of future third-party gas to be processed by our investees. Our investees have capacity to process hydrocarbons from sources other than our Alba field. In 2021, the existing Alba Plant LLC LPG processing plant and the EGHoldings LNG production facility began processing natural gas produced from the third party-owned Alen Unit. Estimated natural gas volumes processed from the Alen Unit are based on forecasts received from the operator of the Alen Unit.
•Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineering studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital programs. The actual timing of the production could be different from the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production from the Alba field that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. The expected timing of production from the Alen Unit is consistent with forecasts received from the operator of that field.
•Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.
We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. This includes the estimated dividends and/or return of capital we expect to be paid by our equity method investees, which are directly affected by the significant assumptions described in the preceding paragraphs. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions in our cash flow calculations is not practicable, given the numerous other assumptions (e.g. reserves, commodity prices, operating costs, inflation and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.
During 2022 and 2021, we had no impairments related to our equity method investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment recognized during 2020.

Impairment Assessments of Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value may have been reduced below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are the same as our reporting segments, of which historically only International included goodwill. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our policy is to first assess the qualitative factors in order to determine whether the fair value of our International reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying amount. Certain qualitative factors used in our evaluation include, among other things, the results of the most recent quantitative assessment of the goodwill impairment test; macroeconomic conditions; industry and market conditions (including commodity prices and cost factors); overall financial performance; and other relevant entity-specific events. If, after considering these events and circumstances we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the International reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. The quantitative goodwill test is performed using a combination of market and income approaches. The market approach references observable inputs specific to us and our industry, such as the price of our common equity, our enterprise value and valuation multiples of us and our peers from the investor analyst community. The income approach utilizes discounted cash flows, which are based on forecasted assumptions. Key assumptions to the income approach are the same as those described above regarding our impairment assessment of long-lived assets and are consistent with those that management uses to make business decisions.
See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the $95 million full impairment of our goodwill in 2020.
Derivatives
We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Fair value measurements for all our derivative instruments are based on observable market-based inputs that are corroborated by market data and are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Pension Plan Assets
Pension plan assets are measured at fair value. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the fair value of plan assets and the presentation of the fair value of our defined benefit pension plan’s assets by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. Estimates of income taxes to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws and assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes.
Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. We provide for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; court proceedings; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
We have recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured at enacted tax rates, for temporary differences between book basis and tax basis, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss carryforwards. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and reduce such assets to the expected realizable amount by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for additional or adjustments to existing valuation allowances, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes reversals of temporary differences, forecasts of future taxable income, assessment of future business assumptions and applicable tax planning strategies that are prudent and feasible. Negative evidence includes losses in recent years, as well as the forecasts of future loss in the realizable period. In making our assessment regarding valuation allowances, we weight the evidence based on objectivity.
We base our future taxable income estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. Numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income, including factors such as future operating conditions and the assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on our U.S. federal income taxes. Future operating conditions can be affected by numerous factors, including (i) future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices, (ii) estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, (iii) expected timing of production, and (iv) future capital requirements. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions resulting in future taxable income calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower capital expenditures.

50

Table of Contents
Based on the assumptions and judgments described above, during the first quarter of 2022, we re-evaluated the realizability of U.S. and state deferred tax assets and determined that a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets was no longer necessary. As such, we recorded a non-cash deferred tax benefit in the first quarter of 2022 for $685 million. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations
Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relates to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations.
We develop our estimate of demographic effects and utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our U.S. pension plans and our other U.S. postretirement benefit plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. In determining the assumed discount rates, our methods include a review of market yields on high-quality corporate debt and use of our third-party actuary’s discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used are rated AA or higher by a recognized rating agency, callable bonds (with the exception of those meeting specific criteria including having more than 10 years remaining until maturity) and outlier bonds (bonds that have a yield to maturity that significantly deviates from the average yield within each maturity grouping) are removed. Each issue is required to have at least $300 million par value outstanding. The constructed yield curve is based on those bonds representing the 50% highest yielding issuances within each defined maturity group.
The asset rate of return assumption for the funded U.S. plan considers the plan’s asset mix (currently targeted at approximately 47% equity and 53% other fixed income securities), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation, debt returns and stock yields.
Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experienc...

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business. The following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 2, 2022, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services: ------------- -------------------- ----- (in millions) Fiscal Year Purchase Obligations 2023 $ 1,632 2024 921 2025 775 2026 753 2027 783 Thereafter 1,226 Total $ 6,090 Royalties We have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded in our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $228 million, $202 million and $176 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers and channel partners against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer's or director's lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments w...

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...
