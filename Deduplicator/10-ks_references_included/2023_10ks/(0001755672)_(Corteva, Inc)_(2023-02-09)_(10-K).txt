complexity of proposed chemicals regulation. The costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal voluntary programs and goals, are significant and will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future.

Pre-tax environmental expenses charged to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below:

-------------------------------- ------------------------------- ---- ---- - --- - ---
 For the Year Ended December 31,
(Dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020
Environmental operating costs $ 154 $ 144 $ 138
Environmental remediation costs1 84 46 63
 $ 238 $ 190 $ 201

1.Environmental remediation costs include costs that are subject to the $200 million threshold and sharing arrangements as discussed in Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under the header Corteva Separation Agreement.

Environmental Operating Costs
As a result of its operations, the company incurs costs for pollution abatement activities including waste collection and disposal, installation and maintenance of air pollution controls and wastewater treatment, emissions testing and monitoring, and obtaining permits. The company also incurs costs related to environmental related research and development activities including environmental field and treatment studies as well as toxicity and degradation testing to evaluate the environmental impact of products and raw materials.

About 85 percent of total pre-tax environmental operating costs charged to income (loss) from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted from operations in the U.S. Based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that year-over-year changes, if any, in environmental operating costs charged to current operations will have a material impact on the company's financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Annual expenditures in the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such expenditures experienced in the past few years. Longer term, expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.

Remediation Accrual
Changes in the remediation accrual balance are summarized below:

------------------------------------- ---- ---
(Dollars in millions)
Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 329
Remediation payments (35)
Net increase in remediation accrual 1 46
Net change, indemnification 2 112
Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 452
Remediation payments (49)
Net increase in remediation accrual 1 84
Net change, indemnification 2 25
Balance at December 31, 20223 $ 512

1.Excludes indemnified remediation obligations.
2.Represents the net change in indemnified remediation obligations based on activity as well as the removal from EIDP's accrued remediation liabilities of obligations that have been fully transferred to Chemours and DuPont. Pursuant to the Chemours Separation Agreement and subsequent MOU, and the Corteva Separation Agreement, as discussed in Note 15 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, EIDP is indemnified by Chemours and DuPont for certain environmental matters.
3.Includes accrued obligations of $137 million due in the next twelve months with the remainder being due subsequent to 2023.

Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to environmental remediation costs and, under adverse changes in circumstances, the potential liability may range up to approximately $600 million above the amount accrued as of December 31, 2022. However, based on existing facts and circumstances, management does not believe that any loss, in excess of amounts accrued, related to remediation activities at any individual site will have a material impact on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the company. Refer to Note 15 – Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for further details on the company’s accrued obligations at December 31, 2022.

As of December 31, 2022, the company has been notified of potential liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("Superfund") or similar state laws at about 500 sites around the U.S., including approximately 120 sites for which the company does not believe it has liability based on current information. Active remediation is under way at approximately 60 of the about 500 sites. In addition, the company has resolved its liability at about 210 sites, either by completing remedial actions with other PRPs or by participating in "de minimis buyouts" with other PRPs whose waste, like the company's, represented only a small fraction of the total waste present at a site. There were no new notices in 2022 or 2021.

Environmental Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures for environmental projects, either required by law or necessary to meet the company’s internal environmental goals, were approximately $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The company currently estimates expenditures for environmental-related capital projects to be approximately $10 million in 2023.

Climate Change
The company believes that climate change is an important global environmental concern that presents risks and opportunities, of which the Sustainability and Innovation Committee of the Board of Directors maintains oversight. Management regularly assesses and manages climate-related issues. Across its business, individuals who are responsible for climate-related initiatives may have annual performance goals tied to the delivery of projects related to these initiatives.

Continuing political and social attention to climate change and its impacts has resulted in regulatory and market-based approaches to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The company believes there is a way forward for sustainable climate change mitigation that both enables farmers to meet the demands of a growing population and secures the economic future for the vast majority of the world’s population who depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.

Extreme and volatile weather due to climate change may have an adverse impact on our customers’ ability to use the company's products and seed supply, potentially reducing sales volumes, revenues and margins. The company continuously evaluates opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of climate-smart agriculture and mitigate the impact of extreme and volatile weather. The company integrates processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risk into its enterprise risk management program.

The company completed a non-financial materiality assessment and identified short-, medium- and long-term climate-related risks and opportunities. The results of this assessment are integrated into the company's businesses, strategy and financial planning. Corteva has an established climate strategy, including commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The company is seeking ways to reduce its impact and providing tools and incentives for customers to do the same. Corteva champions climate positive agriculture, utilizing carbon storage and other means to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits without sacrificing farmer productivity or ongoing profitability.

While Corteva is working to reduce its role in the emission of greenhouse gasses it also invests in enabling innovation that can create a more resilient agriculture value chain. The company engages with multiple stakeholders and partners around the globe regarding our innovations and actionable ideas to help safeguard the health and well-being of the planet and its people.
