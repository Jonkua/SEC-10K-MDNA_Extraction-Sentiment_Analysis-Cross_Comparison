Executive Summary
NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a consumer services company built on dynamic retail brands. NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services, nation-wide in the U.S. and Canada in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. NRG sells power, natural gas, home and power services, and develops innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy, Stream, and XOOM Energy. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately 5.4 million Home customers as well as commercial, industrial, and wholesale customers, supported by approximately 16 GW of generation as of December 31, 2022.
Business Environment
The industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company, its businesses, and the retail energy and power generation industry in 2022 and for the future medium term include:
Market Dynamics — The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, global LNG demand, exports of natural gas, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas customers and producers. In 2022, the average natural gas price at Henry Hub was 73% higher than in 2021.
NRG may experience impacts to gross margins due to significant, rapid changes in current natural gas prices and the lag in its ability to make a corresponding adjustment to the retail rates it charges customers on term and month to month contracts. The Company hedges its load commitments in order to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, and as a result, these gross margin impacts would be realized in future periods until it is able to make the corresponding adjustments to the retail customer rates.
The relative price of natural gas as compared to coal is the primary driver of coal demand. Coal commodity prices decreased in 2022 although supply chain disruptions are still affecting coal deliveries, as further discussed below in Global Supply Chain Disruptions.
Electricity Prices — The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company. Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the Company's profitability. An increase in supply cost volatility in the competitive retail markets may result in smaller companies choosing to exit the market, which may result in further consolidation in the competitive retail space. The following table summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The average on-peak power prices decreased significantly in Texas due to Winter Storm Uri's impact on 2021 pricing. East and West average on-peak prices increased as a result of higher natural gas prices.

Increased Awareness of, and Action to Combat, Climate Change —Diverse groups of stakeholders, including investors, asset managers, financial institutions, non-government organizations, industry coalitions, individual companies, consumer groups and academic institutions, are increasingly engaged in efforts to limit global warming in the post-industrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius. As a result, policymakers and regulators at regional, national, sub-national and local levels of government, both in the U.S. and other parts of the world, are increasingly focused on actions to combat climate change.
NRG actively monitors climate change related developments that could impact its business and regularly engages with a diverse set of stakeholders on these issues. Such engagement helps the Company identify and pursue potential opportunities both to decarbonize its business and better serve its customers. NRG is committed to providing transparent disclosures of its climate risks and opportunities to stakeholders. The Company was an early supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD") recommendations after they were issued in 2017, published a TCFD mapping disclosure in December 2020 and issued a stand-alone TCFD report in December 2021.
Lower Carbon Infrastructure Development — Policy mechanisms at the state and federal level, including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans, have supported and continue to support the development of renewable generation, demand-side and smart grid, and other lower carbon infrastructure technologies. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in August 2022, is intended to further support the deployment of lower carbon energy technologies. As costs associated with the development of lower carbon infrastructure, such as wind and solar generating facilities, continue to evolve and impact development of lower carbon infrastructure in the markets where the Company participates, it may impact the ability of the Company's generating facilities to participate in those markets. According to ERCOT, 41% of 2022 energy consumption in the ERCOT market was generated from carbon emission-free resources, with wind power contributing 25%. In addition, as subsidies and incentives contribute to increases in renewable power sources, customer awareness and preferences are shifting toward sustainable solutions. Increased demand for sustainable energy products from both residential and commercial customers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.
Digitization and Customization — The electric industry is experiencing major technology changes in the way power is distributed and consumed by end-use customers. The electric grid is shifting from a centralized analog system, where power is generated from limited sources and flows in one direction, to a decentralized multidirectional system, where power can be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. In addition, customers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. Technologies like smart thermostats, smart appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage.
Weather — Weather conditions in the regions of the U.S. in which NRG conducts business influence the Company's financial results. Weather conditions can affect the supply and demand for electricity and fuels and may also impact the availability of the Company's generating assets. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time, thus NRG's operations are typically not exposed to the effects of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once.

45

Global Supply Chain Disruptions — There are currently global supply chain disruptions impacting natural gas, coal, solar and other fuels and materials necessary for the production and sale of electricity to the Company's retail customers. These supply chain disruptions are due in part to a number of factors outside the Company's control including geopolitical conflicts, public policy of the federal government, the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages and extreme weather events in the U.S. These factors are impacting the dispatch of generation facilities, as well as the costs to serve retail customers. The Company expects that supply chain disruptions will continue throughout the remainder of 2023. NRG is working closely with its suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts of these events. The Company will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of the supply chain disruptions, and will seek to mitigate and minimize their impact on business.
Other Factors — A number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business. These factors include:
•seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;
•extreme peak demands;
•performance of renewable generation;
•available supply resources;
•transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;
•location of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;
•procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and
•changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.
These factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:
•weather conditions;
•market liquidity;
•capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;
•local transportation systems; and
•the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.

Significant Events
The following significant events occurred during 2022 and through the filing date, as further described within this Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Consolidated Financial Statements:
Vivint Acquisition
On December 6, 2022, NRG and Vivint Smart Home, Inc. announced the entry into a definitive agreement under which the Company will acquire Vivint in an all-cash transaction. The Company will pay $12 per share, or approximately $2.8 billion in cash, and expects to fund the acquisition using proceeds from newly issued debt and preferred equity, drawing on its Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facilities, and through cash on hand. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2023, NRG increased its Revolving Credit Facility by $600 million to meet the additional liquidity requirements related to the acquisition. Close of the acquisition is targeted for the first quarter of 2023 and is subject to customary closing conditions. See Item 15 — Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Astoria
On January 6, 2023, NRG closed on the sale of land and related assets from the Astoria site, within the East region of operations, for initial proceeds of $212 million subject to transaction fees of $3 million and certain indemnifications. As part of the transaction, NRG entered into an agreement to lease the land back for the purpose of operating the Astoria gas turbines through the planned April 30, 2023 retirement date. The operating lease agreement is expected to end six months after the facility's actual retirement date. See Item 15 — Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

46

Sale of Watson
On June 1, 2022, the Company closed on the sale of its 49% ownership in the Watson natural gas generating facility for $59 million. NRG recognized a gain on the sale of $46 million.
Retirement of Joliet
During the second quarter of 2022, the results of the PJM Base Residual Auction for the 2023/2024 delivery year were released leading the Company to revise its long-term view of certain facilities and announce the planned retirement of the Joliet generating facility on June 1, 2023. Impairment losses of $20 million and $130 million were recorded on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.
W.A. Parish Extended Outage
In May 2022, W.A. Parish Unit 8 came offline as a result of damage to the steam turbine/generator. Based on work completed to date, NRG is targeting to return the unit to service by the end of the second quarter of 2023. The Company is working with its insurers related to claims surrounding the outage and has received partial settlements in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Limestone Unit 1 Return to Service
In early July 2021, Limestone Unit 1 came offline as a result of damage to the duct work associated with the FGD system. The extended forced outage ended in April of 2022 and the unit has returned to service.
ERCOT Securitization Proceeds
During February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration as a result of Winter Storm Uri, resulting in a power emergency, blackouts, and an estimated all-time peak demand of 77 GW (without load shed). In 2021, the Texas Legislature passed HB 4492 for ERCOT to mitigate exceptionally high price adders and ancillary service costs incurred by LSEs during Winter Storm Uri. HB 4492 authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute to LSEs that were charged and paid to ERCOT those highly priced ancillary service and ORDPA during Winter Storm Uri. The Company accounted for the proceeds as a reduction to cost of operations within its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the 2021 annual period for which the proceeds were intended to compensate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Winter Storm Uri's pre-tax financial impact to the Company was a loss of $380 million, which reflects the recovery of $689 million of cost of operations as a result of the proceeds. The Company received the proceeds of $689 million from ERCOT in June 2022.
Share Repurchases
In December 2021, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase $1.0 billion of its common stock, of which $44 million was repurchased in 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased $601 million of shares at an average price of $40.50 per share, including $6 million of equivalent shares purchased in lieu of tax withholdings on equity compensation issuances. The remaining $355 million repurchases under the $1.0 billion authorization are expected to be repurchased in 2023, subject to the availability of excess cash and full visibility of the achievement of the Company's 2023 targeted credit metrics. . See Item 15 - Note 16, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Renewable Power Purchase Agreements
The Company's strategy is to procure mid to long-term renewable generation through power purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2022, NRG has entered into Renewable PPAs totaling approximately 2.4 GW, of which approximately 45% are operational. The average tenor of these agreements is twelve years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW entered into through Renewable PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.
Dividend Increase
In the first quarter of 2022, NRG increased the annual dividend to $1.40 from $1.30 per share. In 2023, NRG further increased the annual dividend to $1.51 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2022. The Company expects to target an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years.
COVID-19
While the pandemic presented risks, as further described in Part II, Item 1A — Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, to the Company’s business, there was not a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Gross Margin
The Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as revenues less cost of fuel, purchased energy and other costs of sales, mark-to-market for economic hedging activities, contract and emission credit amortization and depreciation and amortization.

48

Economic Gross Margin
In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of retail revenue, energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels, purchased energy and other cost of sales. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emission credit amortization, depreciation and amortization, operations and maintenance, or other costs of operations.

Lower gross margin due to the impact of Winter Storm Uri in 2021, primarily driven by hedging optimization, partially offset by the negative impact of an increase in unhedgeable ancillary and operating reserve demand curve(a), net of securitization proceeds of $689 million $ (88)
The following explanations exclude the impact of Winter Storm Uri:
Lower gross margin due to the net effect of: •a 40%, or $1 billion increase in overall average costs to serve the retail load, driven by increases in power, ancillary, and fuel costs, an extended outage at W.A. Parish Unit 8 and the more conservative winter hedge profile in the first quarter of 2022, partially offset by the favorable impact of the early settlement of a solar PPA and partial settlements of business interruption insurance claims related to W.A. Parish and Limestone extended outages; and •increased net revenue rates of $9.50 per MWh, or $611 million primarily driven by changes in customer term, product and mix (427)
Higher gross margin due to an increase in load due to weather of 5.3 million MWhs, or $185 million and an increase in load of 220k MWhs, or $58 million, primarily driven by changes in customer mix 243
Lower gross margin from market optimization activities (40)

Liquidity
The principal sources of liquidity for NRG's operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from cash on hand, cash flows from operations and financing arrangements. As described in Item 15 — Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist mainly of the Senior Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, Senior Secured First Lien Notes, Revolving Credit Facility, and tax-exempt bonds.
The Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized by the following: (i) market operations activities; (ii) debt service obligations, as described more fully in Item 15 — Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including maintenance, repowering, development, and environmental; and (iv) allocations in connection with acquisition opportunities, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in Item 15 — Note 16, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company remains committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and continues to work to achieve investment grade credit metrics over time primarily through debt reduction and the realization of growth initiatives.
ERCOT Securitization Proceeds
During February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration as a result of Winter Storm Uri, resulting in a power emergency, blackouts, and an estimated all-time peak demand of 77 GW (without load shed). In 2021, the Texas Legislature passed HB 4492 for ERCOT to mitigate exceptionally high price adders and ancillary service costs incurred by LSEs during Winter Storm Uri. HB 4492 authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute to LSEs that were charged and paid to ERCOT those highly priced ancillary service and ORDPA during Winter Storm Uri. The Company accounted for the proceeds as a reduction to cost of operations within its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the 2021 annual period for which the proceeds were intended to compensate. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Winter Storm Uri's pre-tax financial impact to the Company was a loss of $380 million, which reflects the recovery of $689 million of cost of operations as a result of the proceeds. The Company received the proceeds of $689 million from ERCOT in June 2022.
Winter Storm Uri Credit Loss Recoveries
During Winter Storm Uri, in February 2021, the Company experienced nonperformance by a counterparty in one of its bilateral financial hedging transactions, resulting in exposure of $403 million. During December 2022, the Company received $70 million as part of the Company's loss mitigation efforts in settlement of this exposure.
Brazos Electric Cooperative Bankruptcy
As further discussed in Item 1 — Business, Regulatory Matters, the Company received $29 million as a result of Brazos' chapter 11 plan and the related ERCOT settlement.

See Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases for further discussion.
Receivables Securitization Facilities
On February 9, 2022, the Company entered into amendments to its existing Repurchase Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the size of the facility from $75 million to $150 million and (ii) replace LIBOR with term SOFR as the benchmark for the pricing rate. On July 26, 2022, the Company renewed its existing Repurchase Facility to extend the maturity date to July 26, 2023. The Repurchase Facility has no commitment fee and borrowings will be drawn at SOFR + 1.30%. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings.
On July 26, 2022, NRG Receivables LLC, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into an amendment to its Receivables Facility dated September 22, 2020, with a group of conduit lenders and banks and Royal Bank of Canada, as Administrative Agent to, among other things, (i) extend the scheduled termination date by one year, (ii) increase the aggregate commitments from $800 million to $1.0 billion, (iii) increase the letter of credit sublimit to equal the aggregate commitments, (iv) replace LIBOR with Term SOFR as the benchmark for borrowings and (v) add new originators. The weighted average interest rate related to usage under the Receivables Facility as of December 31, 2022 was 0.844%. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $721 million in letters of credit issued under the Receivables Facility.
Bilateral Letter of Credit Facilities
On April 29, 2022, May 27, 2022 and October 13, 2022, the Company increased the size of the facilities by $100 million, $50 million and $50 million, respectively, to provide additional liquidity, allowing for the issuance of up to $675 million of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2022, $668 million was issued under these facilities.
Vivint Acquisition
On December 6, 2022, NRG and Vivint announced the entry into a definitive agreement under which the Company will acquire Vivint in an all-cash transaction. The Company will pay $12 per share, or approximately $2.8 billion in cash, and expects to fund the acquisition using proceeds from newly issued debt and preferred equity, drawing on its Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Securitization Facilities, and through cash on hand. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2023, NRG increased its Revolving Credit Facility by $600 million to meet the additional liquidity requirements related to the acquisition. Close of the acquisition is targeted for the first quarter of 2023 and is subject to customary closing conditions. See Item 15 — Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Astoria
On January 6, 2023, the Company closed on the sale of land and related assets from the Astoria site, within the East region of operations, for initial proceeds of $212 million subject to transactions fees of $3 million and certain indemnifications. As part of the transaction, NRG entered into an agreement to lease the land back for the purpose of operating the Astoria gas turbines through the planned April 30, 2023, retirement date. The operating lease agreement is expected to end six months after the facility's actual retirement date. See Item 15 — Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Sale of Watson

W.A. Parish Extended Outage
In May 2022, W.A. Parish Unit 8 came offline as a result of damage to certain components of the steam turbine/generator. Based on work completed to date, the Company is targeting to return the unit to service by the end of the second quarter of 2023. The Company is working with its insurers related to claims surrounding the outage and has received partial settlements in the fourth quarter of 2022.

CARES Act
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the CARES Act, which provides, among other things: (i) the option to defer payments of certain 2019 employer payroll taxes incurred after the date of enactment; and (ii) allows NOLs from tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back five years. The total benefit to the Company due to the CARES Act was $35 million. Of this amount, $13 million related to certain 2019 employer payroll taxes was paid in 2022. All deferred employer payroll taxes have been repaid as of December 31, 2022.
Pension and Other postretirement benefit contributions

For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases.
Market Operations
The Company's market operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying fuel before receiving energy revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of December 31, 2022, market operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $260 million and $4.0 billion outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its market activities. As of December 31, 2022, total funds deposited by counterparties were $1.7 billion in cash and $888 million of letters of credit.
The Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements to procure certain fuel and transportation services for the Company's generation assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had minimum payment obligations under such outstanding agreements of $452 million, with $110 million payable within the next 12 months. Additionally, the Company has long-term contractual commitments related to electricity and natural gas products, including power purchases, gas

62

transportation and storage of various quantities and durations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had minimum purchased energy commitments under long-term contracts of $4.3 billion, with $908 million payable within the next 12 months, and an additional $1.5 billion of short-term purchase energy commitments. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies.
Future liquidity requirements may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.
First Lien Structure
NRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, subject to various exclusions including NRG's assets that have project-level financing and the assets of certain non-guarantor subsidiaries, to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements for forward sales of power or MWh equivalents. The first lien program does not limit the volume that can be hedged or the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program also does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.
The Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2022, all hedges under the first liens were out-of-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.
The following table summarizes the amount of MW hedged against the Company's coal and nuclear assets and as a percentage relative to the Company's coal and nuclear capacity under the first lien structure as of December 31, 2022:

Asset Sales Target
NRG is targeting additional asset sales with projected proceeds, net of any required deleveraging, of $500 million during 2023.
Share Repurchases
In December 2021, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase $1.0 billion of its common stock, of which $44 million was repurchased in 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased $601 million of shares at an average price of $40.50 per share, including $6 million of equivalent shares purchased in lieu of tax withholdings on equity compensation issuances. The remaining $355 million repurchases under the $1.0 billion authorization are expected to be repurchased in 2023, subject to the availability of excess cash and full visibility of the achievement of the Company's 2023 targeted credit metrics. See Item 15 - Note 16, Capital Structure, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Dividend Increase
In the first quarter of 2022, NRG increased the annual dividend to $1.40 from $1.30 per share. The Company returned $334 million of capital to shareholders in the year ended 2022 through a $1.40 dividend per common share. In 2023, NRG further increased the annual dividend to $1.51 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2022. The Company expects to target an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years.
On January 20, 2023, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.3775 per share, or $1.51 per share on an annualized basis, payable on February 15, 2023, to stockholders of record as of February 1, 2023. The Company's common stock dividends are subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws and regulations.
Additional Material Cash Requirements Not Discussed Above
Operating leases — The Company leases generating facilities, land, office and equipment, railcars, fleet vehicles and storefront space at retail stores. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had lease payment obligations of $311 million, of which $97 million is payable within the next 12 months. For further discussion, see Item 15 — Note 10, Leases.

Contingent obligations for guarantees — NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnifications and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company’s business activities. For further discussion, see Item 15 —Note 27, Guarantees.
Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity
Variable interest in Equity investments — NRG's investment in Ivanpah is a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary. See also Item 15 — Note 17, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. NRG's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt was approximately $478 million as of December 31, 2022. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG.

NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had domestic pre-tax book income of $1.4 billion and foreign pre-tax book income of $227 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company utilized U.S. federal NOLs of $206 million due to current year taxable income, and tax credits of $8 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has cumulative U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $8.2 billion, which do not have an expiration date, and cumulative state NOL carryforwards of $5.3 billion for financial statement purposes. NRG also has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $382 million, most of which have no expiration date. In addition to the above NOLs, NRG has a $270 million indefinite carryforward for interest deductions, as well as $393 million of tax credits to be utilized in future years. As a result of the Company's tax position, including the utilization of federal and state NOLs, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, due to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, of up to $59 million in 2023.
The Company has $22 million of tax effected uncertain federal and state tax benefits for which the Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of $24 million (including accrued interest) until such final resolution with the related taxing authority.
The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2019. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2014.

Guarantor Financial Information
As of December 31, 2022, the Company's outstanding registered senior notes consisted of $375 million of the 2027 Senior Notes and $821 million of the 2028 Senior Notes, as shown in Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases. These Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of NRG's current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, or guarantor subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). See Exhibit 22.1 for a listing of the Guarantors. These guarantees are both joint and several.
NRG conducts much of its business through and derives much of its income from its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company's ability to make required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to transfer funds to NRG. Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either NRG Energy, Inc. or the Guarantors (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “Non-Guarantors”). The Non-Guarantors include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries.
The tables below present summarized financial information of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with Rule 3-10 under the SEC's Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
NRG may enter into power purchase and sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at power plants or retail load obligations. In addition, in order to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.
NRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.
The tables below disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"). Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2022, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2022. For a full discussion of the Company's valuation methodology of its contracts, see Derivative Fair Value Measurements in Item 15 — Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A — Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk, NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position. As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity. As of December 31, 2022, NRG's net derivative asset was $3.6 billion, an increase to total fair value of $1.2 billion as compared to December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by gains in fair value, partially offset by roll-off of trades that settled during the period.
Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately $1.4 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2022.
The impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately $1.4 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2022.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the accounting guidance has not changed.
NRG evaluates these estimates, on an ongoing basis, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.
 The Company identifies its most critical accounting estimates as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and require the most difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments by management about matters that are inherently uncertain.

Derivative Instruments
The Company follows the guidance of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging "(ASC 815"), to account for derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize fair value change in earnings, unless they qualify for the NPNS exception. ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
For purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, the Company uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.
In order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.
Certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that the Company has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on expected load requirements, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives that are considered to be NPNS are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.

Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets
As of December 31, 2022, NRG’s deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. federal and state NOLs, the difference between book and tax basis in property, plant, and equipment, and tax credit carryforwards. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability by tax jurisdiction.
The Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly on a jurisdictional basis to determine whether adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate considering changes in facts or circumstances. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, when determining the future realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets. Given the Company’s current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the Company expects to generate income before taxes in the U.S. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and the majority of its state NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration.
The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of $224 million as of December 31, 2022 against deferred tax assets consisting of state net operating losses and foreign NOL carryforwards in jurisdictions where the Company does not currently believe that the realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's valuation allowance balance was $248 million.
Considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, including operations located in Australia and Canada. The Company continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions.
The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2019. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2014.
NRG does not intend, nor currently foresee a need, to repatriate funds held at its international operations into the U.S. These funds are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in its foreign operations and the Company has not changed its assertion with respect to distributions of funds that would require the accrual of U.S. income tax.
Evaluation of Assets for Impairment
In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment ("ASC 360"), the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events include:
•Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;
•Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;
•Adverse business climate;
•Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amounts originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;
•Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and
•Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold, or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power and natural gas prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques, such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.
For assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets held-for-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by

70

their nature, subjective. The Company considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence of such information, NRG may consider prices of similar assets, consult with brokers, or employ other valuation techniques. The Company will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or asset. The use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in NRG's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.
Annually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the Company's fundamental view for long-term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. Changes to the Company's views of long-term power and fuel prices impact the Company’s projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for its operations and the physical and economic characteristics of each of its businesses.
For further discussion, see Item 15 —Note 11 , Asset Impairments.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
At December 31, 2022, the Company reported goodwill of $1.7 billion, consisting of $1.2 billion from the acquisition of Direct Energy in 2021 and $408 million for retail operations acquisitions, including Stream Energy, which was acquired in 2019.
The Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations ("ASC 805"), and ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ("ASC 350") to account for its goodwill and intangible assets. Under these standards, the Company amortizes all finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the Company's operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31 or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit may be below the carrying amount. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing to its book value. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, the Company's goodwill will be impaired at that time.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.
For further discussion, see Evaluation of Assets for Impairment caption above, and Item 15 —Note 11, Asset Impairments.
Business Combinations
NRG accounts for business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed under ASC 805. Under this method, the Company is required to record on its Consolidated Balance Sheets the estimated fair values of the acquired company’s assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires significant estimates and judgments. Fair value is determined based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities that involved the most subjectivity in determining fair value consisted of the trade names, customer relationships and derivative contracts.
The fair value of trade names and customer relationships are measured using income-based valuation methodologies, which include certain assumptions such as forecasted future cash flows, customer attrition rates, royalty rates and discount rates. The trade names are amortized to depreciation and amortization, on a straight line basis. The customer relationships are amortized to depreciation and amortization, ratably based on discounted future cash flows.
In measuring the fair value of derivative contracts for Direct Energy, a significant portion of the fair value of the derivative portfolio was based on price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate those transactions and the Company believes such price quotes are executable. The Company does not use third-party sources that derive price based on proprietary models or market surveys. The remainder of the assets and liabilities represents contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts were valued based on various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. The fair value of each contract was discounted using a risk free interest rate. In addition, the Company

71

applied a credit reserve to reflect credit risk. NRG describes in detail its acquisitions in Item 15 — Note 4, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Contingencies
NRG records reserves for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies are not recorded until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 — Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sale of Watson
On June 1, 2022, the Company closed on the sale of its 49% ownership in the Watson natural gas generating facility for $59 million. NRG recognized a gain on the sale of $46 million.
Retirement of Joliet
During the second quarter of 2022, the results of the PJM Base Residual Auction for the 2023/2024 delivery year were released leading the Company to revise its long-term view of certain facilities and announce the planned retirement of the Joliet generating facility on June 1, 2023. Impairment losses of $20 million and $130 million were recorded on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.
W.A. Parish Extended Outage
In May 2022, W.A. Parish Unit 8 came offline as a result of damage to the steam turbine/generator. Based on work completed to date, NRG is targeting to return the unit to service by the end of the second quarter of 2023. The Company is working with its insurers related to claims surrounding the outage and has received partial settlements in the fourth quarter of 2022.
Limestone Unit 1 Return to Service
In early July 2021, Limestone Unit 1 came offline as a result of damage to the duct work associated with the FGD system. The extended forced outage ended in April of 2022 and the unit has returned to service.
ERCOT Securitization Proceeds
During February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration as a result of Winter Storm Uri, resulting in a power emergency, blackouts, and an estimated all-time peak demand of 77 GW (without load shed). In 2021, the Texas Legislature passed HB 4492 for ERCOT to mitigate exceptionally high price adders and ancillary service costs incurred by LSEs during Winter Storm Uri. HB 4492 authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute to LSEs that were charged and paid to ERCOT those highly priced ancillary service and ORDPA during Winter Storm Uri. The Company accounted for the proceeds as a reduction to cost of operations within its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the 2021 annual period for which the proceeds were intended to compensate.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

['s strategy is to procure mid to long-term renewable generation through power purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2022, NRG has entered into Renewable PPAs totaling approximately 2.4 GW, of which approximately 45% are operational. The average tenor of these agreements is twelve years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW entered into through Renewable PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.
Dividend Increase
In the first quarter of 2022, NRG increased the annual dividend to $1.40 from $1.30 per share. In 2023, NRG further increased the annual dividend to $1.51 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2022. The Company expects to target an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years.
COVID-19
While the pandemic presented risks, as further described in Part II, Item 1A — Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, to the Company’s business, there was not a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...
