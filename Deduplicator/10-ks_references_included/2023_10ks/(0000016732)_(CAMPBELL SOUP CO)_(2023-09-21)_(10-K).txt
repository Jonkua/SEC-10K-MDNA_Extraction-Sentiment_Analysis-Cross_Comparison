Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," as well as the information contained in "Risk Factors."
Unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Executive Summary
We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories.
In 2023 we delivered strong growth against all of our key financial metrics, exceeding our initial expectations and advancing many of our key strategic initiatives. During 2023, we navigated through a challenging environment marked by continued supply chain pressures, particularly around high input cost inflation. Our improved supply chain execution combined with inflation-driven pricing, continued supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives partially mitigated ongoing inflationary pressures experienced in 2023.
Strategy
Our strategy is to unlock our full growth potential by focusing on our core brands in two divisions within North America while delivering on the promise of our purpose - Connecting people through food they love. Our strategic plan is based on four pillars: build a winning team and culture; accelerate profitable growth; fuel investments and margins with targeted cost savings; and deliver on the promise of our purpose all as further discussed below.
We plan to continue our focus on building a winning team and culture by driving organizational engagement, belonging and effectiveness through our new employee value proposition: Make history with Campbell’s, and modernizing our facilities. In 2023, we announced the consolidation of our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina and Norwalk, Connecticut into Camden, New Jersey and a $50 million investment in the Camden campus. We expect a single headquarters will accelerate our plan to build a winning team and culture by investing in our campus and our people. In addition, we plan to continue to deliver on the promise of our purpose with continued progress on our sustainability goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate.

17

We believe that we can accelerate our profitable growth model by growing market share and driving integrated business planning programming throughout the company. We expect to expand into new market segments through retail execution, marketing and innovation. In addition, we expect to continue to focus on accelerating the growth of our Snacks brands while also sustaining the growth in U.S. soup and our other core brands.
We also expect to fuel investments and margins by continuing to focus on effective revenue management, transforming our supply chain into a competitive advantage, and finding innovative ways to enhance our products and processes to unlock cost efficiencies and savings across the enterprise. We continue to pursue our multi-year cost savings initiatives with targeted annualized cost savings of $1 billion for continuing operations by the end of 2025, with $890 million in cost savings achieved through 2023. See "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information on these initiatives.
Business Trends
Our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including: cost inflation; changing consumer preferences; and a competitive and dynamic retail environment.
Our strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience. For example, we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume and are continuing in-home eating behaviors that were driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms, including supplier-funded customized products. Any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. Retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products, especially on price.
Throughout 2022 and continuing into 2023, our industry has been impacted by supply chain disruptions, commodity cost volatility, labor market issues, input cost inflation, and other global macroeconomic challenges. Throughout 2023, we have experienced some moderation in input cost inflation, and we expect modest pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2024. We anticipate continued supply chain productivity and previously implemented pricing actions to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures, and expect such benefits to largely offset the incremental costs in 2024. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition. We will also be lapping 2023 price increases, and anticipate that favorable net price realization will represent a reduced contribution to sales in 2024.
Recent Developments
On August 7, 2023, we entered into an agreement to acquire Sovos Brands, Inc. (Sovos Brands) for $23.00 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $2.7 billion. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and termination rights, including the approval of Sovos Brands’ shareholders and regulatory approvals. We plan to finance the acquisition through the issuance of new debt. For additional information on this pending acquisition, see our Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 7, 2023, and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Summary of Results
This Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
There were 52 weeks in 2023, 2022 and 2021.
•Net sales increased 9% in 2023 to $9.357 billion with the benefit of favorable inflation-driven net price realization more than offsetting unfavorable volume/mix.
•Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased to 31.2% in 2023 from 30.7% a year ago. The increase was primarily due to favorable net price realization, supply chain productivity improvements and mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges, partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs as well as unfavorable volume/mix.
•Earnings per share were $2.85 in 2023, compared to $2.51 a year ago. The current year included expenses of $.15 per share and the prior year included expenses of $.34 per share from items impacting comparability as discussed below.
Net Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2023 Compared with 2022
The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:
•In 2023, we recognized actuarial gains on our pension and postretirement plans in Other expenses / (income) of $15 million ($11 million after tax, or $.04 per share). In 2022, we recognized actuarial losses in Other expenses / (income) of $44 million ($33 million after tax, or $.11 per share);

•In 2023, we recognized gains in Cost of products sold of $21 million ($16 million after tax, or $.05 per share) associated with unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges. In 2022, we recognized losses in Cost of products sold of $59 million ($44 million after tax, or $.15 per share) associated with unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges;
•We implemented several cost savings initiatives in recent years. In 2023, we recorded Restructuring charges of $16 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $24 million in Administrative expenses, $18 million in Cost of products sold, $5 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $3 million in Research and development expenses (aggregate impact of $50 million after tax, or $.17 per share) related to these initiatives. In 2022, we recorded Restructuring charges of $5 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $20 million in Administrative expenses, $5 million in Cost of products sold and $1 million in Marketing and selling expenses (aggregate impact of $24 million after tax, or $.08 per share) related to these initiatives. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives" for additional information;
•In 2023, we recorded a pre- and after-tax loss in Other expenses / (income) of $13 million ($.04 per share) on the sale of our Emerald nuts business, which was sold on May 30, 2023;
•In 2023, we recorded accelerated amortization expense in Other expenses / (income) of $7 million ($5 million after tax, or $.02 per share) related to customer relationship intangible assets due to the loss of certain contract manufacturing customers;
•In the first quarter of 2024, we announced our intent to acquire Sovos Brands. In 2023, we incurred transaction costs in Other expenses / (income) of $5 million ($4 million after tax, or $.01 per share) associated with the pending acquisition, which we expect to close by the end of December 2023; and
•In 2022, we recorded a loss in Interest expense of $4 million ($3 million after tax, or $.01 per share) on the extinguishment of debt.

In 2023, Meals & Beverages sales increased 7% primarily due to increases in U.S. retail products, including U.S. soup and Prego pasta sauces, as well as gains in foodservice. Favorable net price realization was partially offset by lower volume/mix. Sales of U.S. soup increased 3% primarily due to increases in ready-to-serve soups and broth.
In 2022, Meals & Beverages sales were comparable with prior year. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of the Plum baby food and snacks business, sales increased primarily due to increases in U.S. soup and foodservice, partially offset by declines in V8 beverages. Favorable inflation-driven net price realization was partially offset by lower volume/mix, which decreased primarily due to supply constraints driven by labor and materials availability and price elasticities. Sales of U.S. soup increased 3% due to increases in ready-to-serve soups, condensed soups and broth.
In 2023, Snacks sales increased 13% driven by sales of our power brands which increased 17%. Sales increased due to increases in cookies and crackers, primarily Goldfish crackers and Lance sandwich crackers, and in salty snacks, primarily Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels and Kettle Brand and Cape Cod potato chips. Sales benefited from favorable net price realization.
In 2022, Snacks sales increased 3% driven by sales of our power brands which increased 7%. Sales increased due to increases in cookies and crackers, primarily Goldfish crackers, and in salty snacks, primarily Snyder’s of Hanover pretzels and Kettle Brand potato chips which more than offset declines in Late July snacks, partially offset by declines in non-core businesses. Favorable inflation-driven net price realization was partly offset by a decline in volume/mix. Volume/mix declined driven by supply constraints due to labor and materials availability and price elasticities.
Gross Profit
Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by $290 million in 2023 from 2022 and decreased by $184 million in 2022 from 2021. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 31.2% in 2023, 30.7% in 2022 and 33.2% in 2021.
The 50 basis-point increase and the 250 basis-point decrease in gross profit margin in 2023 and 2022, respectively, were due to the following factors:

(2)Includes the impact of operating leverage.
Marketing and Selling Expenses
Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 8.7% in 2023, 8.6% in 2022 and 9.6% in 2021. Marketing and selling expenses increased 10% in 2023 from 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher advertising and consumer promotion expense (approximately 7 points) and higher selling expenses (approximately 6 points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 points). The increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense was due in part to moderated levels in the prior year from supply constraints.
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 10% in 2022 from 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expense (approximately 10 points). The reduction in advertising and consumer promotion expense was primarily due to supply constraints.
Administrative Expenses
Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.0% in 2023, 7.2% in 2022 and 7.1% in 2021. Administrative expenses increased 6% in 2023 from 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 8 points) and higher incentive compensation (approximately 2 points), partially offset by lower expenses related to the settlement of certain legal claims (approximately 4 points). Administrative expenses in 2023 included $14 million of litigation expenses related to the Plum baby food and snacks business, which we divested in May 2021.
Administrative expenses increased 3% in 2022 from 2021. The increase was primarily due to expenses related to the settlement of certain legal claims (approximately 3 points) and higher general administrative costs (approximately 3 points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 3 points).

__________________________________________
(1)See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring charges.
Operating earnings from Meals & Beverages increased 2% in 2023 versus 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin decreased due to unfavorable volume/mix, with favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements more than offsetting higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs.
Operating earnings from Meals & Beverages decreased 5% in 2022 versus 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower gross profit and higher administrative expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin declined driven by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs as well as unfavorable volume/mix, partially offset by favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements.
Operating earnings from Snacks increased 24% in 2023 versus 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin increased due to favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs as well as unfavorable volume/mix.
Operating earnings from Snacks increased 1% in 2022 versus 2021. The increase primarily due to lower marketing and selling expenses and slightly higher gross profit, partially offset by higher administrative expenses due to the settlement of certain legal claims.
Corporate expense in 2023 included the following:
•costs of $50 million related to cost savings initiatives;
•a loss of $13 million from the sale of the Emerald nuts business;
•$7 million of accelerated amortization expense;

•a loss of $11 million from the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business.

23

Excluding these amounts, the remaining change in 2023 from 2022 was primarily due to lower net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income in the current year and higher administrative expenses, including litigation expenses related to the Plum baby food and snacks business.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased to $188 million in 2023 from $189 million in 2022. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4 million in 2022, partially offset by higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio.
Interest expense decreased to $189 million in 2022 from $210 million in 2021. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower levels of debt, partially offset by a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4 million in 2022.
Taxes on Earnings
The effective tax rate was 23.9% in 2023, 22.4% in 2022 and 24.6% in 2021.
The increase in the effective tax rate in 2023 from 2022 was primarily due to the favorable impact of state income tax law changes in 2022.
The decrease in the effective rate in 2022 from 2021 was primarily due to a $19 million deferred tax charge recognized in the second quarter of 2021 in connection with a legal entity reorganization as part of the continued integration of Snyder's-Lance and state income tax law changes.
Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives
Multi-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance Cost Transformation Program and Integration
Continuing Operations
Beginning in fiscal 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure.
Over the years, we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks, as well as our information technology infrastructure.
On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated Snyder's-Lance.
In 2022, we expanded these initiatives as we continue to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management. In the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to consolidate our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Norwalk, Connecticut, into our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. Cost estimates for these expanded initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.
A summary of charges recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings related to these initiatives is as follows:

------------------------------------ ---- --- ---- -- ---- --- ------------------------------ - --- - ---
(Millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2021 Recognized as of July 30, 2023
Restructuring charges $ 16 $ 5 $ 21 $ 280
Administrative expenses 24 20 28 383
Cost of products sold 18 5 3 102
Marketing and selling expenses 5 1 1 19
Research and development expenses 3 — — 7
Total pre-tax charges $ 66 $ 31 $ 53 $ 791

Aggregate after-tax impact $ 50 $ 24 $ 40
Per share impact $ .17 $ .08 $ .13

24

A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with these initiatives is as follows:

-------------------------------------------- ------------------------------ ---
(Millions) Recognized as of July 30, 2023
Severance pay and benefits $ 240
Asset impairment/accelerated depreciation 106
Implementation costs and other related costs 445
Total $ 791

The total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified are approximately $885 million to $905 million and we expect to incur the costs through 2025. These estimates will be updated as the expanded initiatives are developed.
We expect the costs for actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $245 million to $250 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $140 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $500 million to $515 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately 32%; Snacks - approximately 43%; and Corporate - approximately 25%.
Of the aggregate $885 million to $905 million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect approximately $705 million to $725 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $620 million in capital expenditures through 2025, of which we invested $467 million as of July 30, 2023. The capital expenditures primarily relate to optimization of production within our Meals & Beverages manufacturing network, a U.S. warehouse optimization project, improvement of quality, safety and cost structure across the Snyder’s-Lance manufacturing network, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications, implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance, enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, and optimization of the Snyder’s-Lance warehouse and distribution network.
We expect to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.
We expect the initiatives, once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $1 billion by the end of 2025. As of July 30, 2023, we have generated total program-to-date pre-tax savings of $890 million.
Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with segments is as follows:

----------------- ---- -- ---------------------- --- - ---
(Millions) 2023 Costs Incurred to Date
Meals & Beverages $ 26 $ 251
Snacks 24 345
Corporate 16 195
Total $ 66 $ 791

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Discontinued Operations
We completed the sale of our Kelsen business on September 23, 2019, and the sale of the Arnott’s and certain other international operations on December 23, 2019. In the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $6 million loss due to tax expense from return-to-provision adjustments related to the sale of these businesses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.
We generated cash flows from operations of $1.143 billion in 2023, compared to $1.181 billion in 2022. The decline in 2023 was primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher cash earnings.
We generated cash flows from operations of $1.181 billion in 2022, compared to $1.035 billion in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due changes in working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings.
Current assets are less than current liabilities, which include debt maturing in one year, as we focus on lowering core working capital requirements. We had negative working capital of $161 million as of July 30, 2023, and $923 million as of July 31, 2022. Total debt maturing within one year was $191 million as of July 30, 2023, and $814 million as of July 31, 2022.

25

As part of our focus to lower core working capital requirements, we have worked with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 120 days. We also maintain agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. We have not pledged assets as security or provided any guarantees in connection with these arrangements. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Amounts outstanding under these programs, which are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $258 million at July 30, 2023, and $262 million at July 31, 2022.
Capital expenditures were $370 million in 2023, $242 million in 2022 and $275 million in 2021. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $440 million in 2024. Capital expenditures in 2023 included chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business and a new manufacturing line for our Meals & Beverages business. Capital expenditures in 2022 included improvement of the quality and cost structure of the Snyder's-Lance manufacturing network, the continued implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance and cookie and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business. Capital expenditures in 2021 included the continued implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Snyder's-Lance, chip capacity expansion projects, a Milano cookie capacity expansion project and a Goldfish cracker capacity expansion project.
In Snacks, we have a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. In order to maintain and expand this model, we routinely purchase and sell routes. The purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities.
On May 3, 2021, we completed the sale of our Plum baby food and snacks business for $101 million.
On May 30, 2023, we completed the sale of our Emerald nuts business for $41 million.
Dividend payments were $447 million in 2023, $451 million in 2022 and $439 million in 2021. Annual dividends declared were $1.48 per share in both 2023 and 2022 and $1.46 per share in 2021. The 2023 fourth quarter dividend was $.37 per share. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
In June 2021, the Board authorized an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million (June 2021 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The June 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the anti-dilutive program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to $500 million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In 2023, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $142 million. Of this amount, $68 million was used to repurchase shares pursuant to our June 2021 program and $74 million was used to repurchase share pursuant to our September 2021 program. As of July 30, 2023, approximately $104 million remained available under the June 2021 program and approximately $301 million remained under the September 2021 program. In 2022, we repurchased 3.8 million shares at a cost of $167 million. In 2021, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares at a cost of $36 million. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Market for Registrant's Capital Stock, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" for additional information.
On November 15, 2022, we entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the DDTL Credit Agreement) totaling up to $500 million scheduled to mature on November 15, 2025. Loans under the DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type. We borrowed $500 million under the DDTL Credit Agreement on March 13, 2023, and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the 3.65% $566 million Notes that matured on March 15, 2023.
On March 4, 2022, we completed the redemption of all $450 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.50% Senior Notes due August 2, 2022. The consideration for the redemption was $453 million, including $3 million of premium. We recognized a loss of $4 million (including the $3 million of premium and other costs), which was recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In addition, we paid accrued and unpaid interest on the redeemed notes through the date of settlement. We used a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt to fund the redemption.

26

In March 2021, we repaid our 3.30% $321 million Notes and floating rate $400 million Notes, and in May 2021, we repaid our 8.875% $200 million Notes. The repayments were funded with available cash and commercial paper issuances.
As of July 30, 2023, we had $191 million of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $178 million was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of July 30, 2023, we issued $29 million of standby letters of credit. On September 27, 2021, we entered into a committed revolving credit facility totaling $1.85 billion scheduled to mature on September 27, 2026. This facility remained unused at July 30, 2023, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. The facility contains customary covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the credit facility) of not less than 3.25:1.00, measured quarterly, and customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. Loans under this facility will bear interest at the rates specified in the facility, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other customary conditions. The facility supports our commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements.
On April 4, 2023, we entered into an amendment to our existing revolving credit facility to replace remaining LIBOR-based benchmark rates applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility with SOFR-based benchmark rates, in advance of the cessation of LIBOR occurring on June 30, 2023.
We are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities.
In August 2023, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions.
We intend to finance the pending Sovos Brands acquisition with the issuance of new debt.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
Contractual Obligations
We have short- and long-term material cash requirements related to our contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business. In addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations, our contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase commitments, lease payments and pension and postretirement benefits.
See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our principal payments for short-term borrowings and long-term debt obligations as of July 30, 2023. Interest payments primarily for short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of July 30, 2023 are approximately as follows: $188 million in 2024; $305 million in 2025 through 2026; $218 million in 2027 through 2028; and $1.129 billion from 2029 through maturity. Interest payments are based on principal amounts and coupons or contractual rates at fiscal year end.
Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. As of July 30, 2023, purchase commitments totaled approximately $1.762 billion. Approximately $1.31 billion of these purchase commitments will be settled in the ordinary course of business in the next 12 months and the balance of $452 million from 2025 through 2031.
See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our lease obligations as of July 30, 2023.
As of July 30, 2023, we have a pension liability of $105 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of $153 million. As of July 30, 2023, we also have a pension asset of $164 million based on the funded status of certain plans. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Critical Accounting Estimates" for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments
We guarantee approximately 4,700 bank loans made to independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $496 million as of July 30, 2023. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.
These obligations and commitments impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.

27

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY
The principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. We manage our foreign currency exposures by utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and we may utilize interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. We principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, diesel fuel, natural gas, soybean oil, aluminum, cocoa, corn, soybean meal and butter. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments.
The information below summarizes our market risks associated with significant financial instruments as of July 30, 2023. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 12, 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily the Canadian dollar, related to intercompany transactions and third-party transactions. We utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The notional amounts of the contracts as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, were $140 million and $153 million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $1 million as of July 30, 2023, and a gain of $2 million as of July 31, 2022. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in exchange rates would impact the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts by approximately $17 million as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.
As of July 30, 2023, we had outstanding variable-rate debt of $678 million with an average interest rate of 6.18%. As of July 31, 2022, we had outstanding variable-rate debt of $235 million with an average interest rate of 2.63%. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in average interest rates applied to our variable-rate debt balances throughout 2023 and 2022 would have increased annual interest expense in those years by approximately $4 million and $1 million, respectively.
As of July 30, 2023, we had outstanding fixed-rate debt of $4.041 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.79%. As of July 31, 2022, we had outstanding fixed-rate debt of $4.609 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.76%. The fair value of fixed-rate debt was $3.615 billion as of July 30, 2023 and $4.402 billion as of July 31, 2022. As of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $221 million and $274 million, respectively, while a hypothetical 100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $256 million and $318 million, respectively. The impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position.
We enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts, and a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. As of July 30, 2023, the total notional amount of the contracts was $241 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $11 million. As of July 31, 2022, the total notional amount of these contracts was $296 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $7 million. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices would impact the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts by approximately $25 million as of July 30, 2023, and $30 million as of July 31, 2022, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.
We enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to the total return of certain deferred compensation obligations. The notional amount of the contracts was $42 million as of July 30, 2023, and $50 million as of July 31, 2022. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $4 million as of July 30, 2023, and a loss of $4 million as of July 31, 2022. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in equity price changes would impact the fair value of our outstanding swap contracts by $5 million as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:

28

Trade and consumer promotion programs — We offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupons. The mix between these forms of variable consideration, which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors, including expected volume. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. Differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates. Accrued trade and consumer promotion liabilities as of July 30, 2023 and July 31, 2022 were $156 million and $141 million, respectively.

Valuation of long-lived assets — Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill in the reporting unit.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation method based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value.
As of July 30, 2023, the carrying value of goodwill was $3.965 billion. Based on our assessments, all of our reporting units had fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.
As of July 30, 2023, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $2.541 billion as detailed below:

----------------------- --- -----
(Millions)
Snyder's of Hanover $ 620
Lance 350
Kettle Brand 318
Pace 292
Pacific Foods 280
Cape Cod 187
Various other Snacks(1) 494
Total $ 2,541

_____________________________________
(1)Associated with the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance.
As of the 2023 annual impairment testing, indefinite-lived trademarks with approximately 10% or less of excess coverage of fair value over carrying value had an aggregate carrying value of $434 million and included the Pacific Foods and certain other Snacks trademarks. Although assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation, sensitivities to changes are provided below. Holding all other assumptions in our 2023 impairment testing constant, changes in the assumptions below would reduce fair value of trademarks and result in impairment charges of approximately:

29

--------------------------------------------------- ------------- -- -------------------- - --
(Millions) Pacific Foods Various other Snacks
1% increase in the weighted-average cost of capital $ 20 $ 25
1% reduction in revenue growth $ — $ 10
1% decrease in royalty rate $ 20 $ 50

While the 1% changes in assumptions would not result in impairment charges on our other trademarks, some changes would reduce the excess coverage of fair value over carrying value to less than 10% for the Snyder's of Hanover, Kettle Brand, Cape Cod and Pace trademarks.
The estimates of future cash flows used in impairment testing are made at a point in time, involve considerable management judgment, and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, assumed royalty rates, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions. If our assumptions change or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result.
See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.

Pension and postretirement benefits — We provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets.
In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. We use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows.
The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date.
As of July 30, 2023, we have a pension liability of $105 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of $153 million. As of July 30, 2023, we also have a pension asset of $164 million based on the funded status of certain plans.
Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense (income) and actuarial losses (gains) included within net periodic pension and benefit expense (income) were as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- --- - -----
(Millions) 2023 2022 2021
Total net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense (income) $ (22) $ (7) $ (267)
Actuarial losses (gains) $ (15) $ 44 $ (203)

The pension actuarial gains recognized in 2023 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation, partially offset by losses on plan assets and plan experience. The pension actuarial losses recognized in 2022 were primarily due to to losses on plan assets, partially offset by increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation. The pension actuarial gains recognized in 2021 were primarily due to higher than anticipated investment gains on plan assets and increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation.
Excluding actuarial gains and losses, net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income was $44 million lower in 2023 compared to 2022. Based on benefit obligations and plan assets as of July 30, 2023, net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income excluding any actuarial losses or gains is estimated to be approximately $13 million lower in 2024, subject to the impact of interim remeasurements. The decrease in 2024 is primarily due to a lower market value of plan assets.

30

Significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:

------------------------------------- ----- ----- -----
 2023 2022 2021
Pension
Discount rate for benefit obligations 5.46% 4.58% 2.69%
Expected return on plan assets 6.38% 6.40% 5.82%
Postretirement
Discount rate for obligations 5.47% 4.48% 2.37%

Based on benefit obligations and plan assets as of July 30, 2023, estimated sensitivities to 2024 annual net periodic pension and postretirement cost are as follows:
•a 50-basis-point increase in the discount rate would result in expense of approximately $5 million and would result in an immediate actuarial gain recognition of approximately $43 million;
•a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would result in income of approximately $5 million and would result in an immediate actuarial loss recognition of approximately $53 million; and
•a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would result in expense of approximately $5 million.
Contributions to pension plans were not material in 2023, 2022 and 2021 and are not expected to be material in 2024.
See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits.

Income taxes — The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
See also Notes 1 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes.

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit. Reconciliation of Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes Total income tax expense differed from the income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the following: ---------------------------------------...

Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish subsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights. As a result of these transactions, we recorded deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, and related tax benefits totaling $1.35 billion, based on the fair value of the IP rights transferred. The determination of the fair value involves significant judgment on future revenue growth, operating margins and discount rates. The tax-deductible amortization related to the transferred IP rights is recognized over the period of economic benefit.

(5)As discussed below (see "Industry Overview and Economic Outlook"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association ("ARA"). As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent. Global Economic Conditions and COVID-19 Our operations are impacted by global economic conditions, including inflation, increased interest rates and supply chain constraints, and we take actions to modify our plans to address such economic conditions. In 2022, for example, we intentionally held back on sales of rental equipment to ensure we had sufficient capacity for our customers. In 2022, revenue from sales of rental equipment was largely flat year-over-year, however the number of units sold decreased approximately 17 percent year-over-year, as we held on to fleet to serve strong customer demand and to ensure greater fleet availability in the event industry supply chain challenges persist or worsen. While the volume of sales of rental equipment decreased year-over-year, gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 14.2 percentage points, which primarily reflected strong pricing and improved channel mix. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience more severe supply chain disruptions in the future. Interest rates on our debt instruments have increased recently. For example, in November 2022, URNA issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes at a 6 percent i...

Business Trends
Our businesses are being influenced by a variety of trends that we anticipate will continue in the future, including: cost inflation; changing consumer preferences; and a competitive and dynamic retail environment.
Our strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for snacking and convenience. For example, we believe that consumers are changing their eating habits by increasing the type and frequency of snacks they consume and are continuing in-home eating behaviors that were driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms, including supplier-funded customized products. Any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. Retailers also continue to grow and promote store brands that compete with branded products, especially on price.
Throughout 2022 and continuing into 2023, our industry has been impacted by supply chain disruptions, commodity cost volatility, labor market issues, input cost inflation, and other global macroeconomic challenges. Throughout 2023, we have experienced some moderation in input cost inflation, and we expect modest pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2024. We anticipate continued supply chain productivity and previously implemented pricing actions to mitigate some of the inflationary pressures, and expect such benefits to largely offset the incremental costs in 2024. We will continue to evaluate the evolving macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition. We will also be lapping 2023 price increases, and anticipate that favorable net price realization will represent a reduced contribution to sales in 2024.
Recent Developments
On August 7, 2023, we entered into an agreement to acquire Sovos Brands, Inc. (Sovos Brands) for $23.00 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $2.7 billion. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and termination rights, including the approval of Sovos Brands’ shareholders and regulatory approvals. We plan to finance the acquisition through the issuance of new debt. For additional information on this pending acquisition, see our Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 7, 2023, and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Summary of Results
This Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows.
There were 52 weeks in 2023, 2022 and 2021.
•Net sales increased 9% in 2023 to $9.357 billion with the benefit of favorable inflation-driven net price realization more than offsetting unfavorable volume/mix.
•Gross profit, as a percent of sales, increased to 31.2% in 2023 from 30.7% a year ago. The increase was primarily due to favorable net price realization, supply chain productivity improvements and mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges, partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs as well as unfavorable volume/mix.
•Earnings per share were $2.85 in 2023, compared to $2.51 a year ago. The current year included expenses of $.15 per share and the prior year included expenses of $.34 per share from items impacting comparability as discussed below.
Net Earnings attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2023 Compared with 2022
The following items impacted the comparability of net earnings and net earnings per share:
•In 2023, we recognized actuarial gains on our pension and postretirement plans in Other expenses / (income) of $15 million ($11 million after tax, or $.04 per share). In 2022, we recognized actuarial losses in Other expenses / (income) of $44 million ($33 million after tax, or $.11 per share);

18

•In 2023, we recognized gains in Cost of products sold of $21 million ($16 million after tax, or $.05 per share) associated with unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges. In 2022, we recognized losses in Cost of products sold of $59 million ($44 million after tax, or $.15 per share) associated with unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding undesignated commodity hedges;
•We implemented several cost savings initiatives in recent years. In 2023, we recorded Restructuring charges of $16 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $24 million in Administrative expenses, $18 million in Cost of products sold, $5 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $3 million in Research and development expenses (aggregate impact of $50 million after tax, or $.17 per share) related to these initiatives. In 2022, we recorded Restructuring charges of $5 million and implementation costs and other related costs of $20 million in Administrative expenses, $5 million in Cost of products sold and $1 million in Marketing and selling expenses (aggregate impact of $24 million after tax, or $.08 per share) related to these initiatives.

Note 19. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 129 68 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Kinder Morgan, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Kinder Morgan, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.

['s-Lance, enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey, and optimization of the Snyder’s-Lance warehouse and distribution network.
We expect to fund the costs through cash flows from operations and short-term borrowings.
We expect the initiatives, once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $1 billion by the end of 2025. As of July 30, 2023, we have generated total program-to-date pre-tax savings of $890 million.
Segment operating results do not include restructuring charges, implementation costs and other related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with segments is as follows:

----------------- ---- -- ---------------------- --- - ---
(Millions) 2023 Costs Incurred to Date
Meals & Beverages $ 26 $ 251
Snacks 24 345
Corporate 16 195
Total $ 66 $ 791

See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Discontinued Operations
We completed the sale of our Kelsen business on September 23, 2019, and the sale of the Arnott’s and certain other international operations on December 23, 2019. In the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a $6 million loss due to tax expense from return-to-provision adjustments related to the sale of these businesses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.
We generated cash flows from operations of $1.143 billion in 2023, compared to $1.181 billion in 2022. The decline in 2023 was primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher cash earnings.
We generated cash flows from operations of $1.181 billion in 2022, compared to $1.035 billion in 2021. The increase in 2022 was primarily due changes in working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings.
Current assets are less than current liabilities, which include debt maturing in one year, as we focus on lowering core working capital requirements. We had negative working capital of $161 million as of July 30, 2023, and $923 million as of July 31, 2022. Total debt maturing within one year was $191 million as of July 30, 2023, and $814 million as of July 31, 2022.

25

As part of our focus to lower core working capital requirements, we have worked with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 120 days. We also maintain agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. We have not pledged assets as security or provided any guarantees in connection with these arrangements. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Amounts outstanding under these programs, which are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $258 million at July 30, 2023, and $262 million at July 31, 2022.
Capital expenditures were $370 million in 2023, $242 million in 2022 and $275 million in 2021. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $440 million in 2024. Capital expenditures in 2023 included chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business and a new manufacturing line for our Meals & Beverages business. Capital expenditures in 2022 included improvement of the quality and cost structure of the Snyder']:

On November 15, 2022, we entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the DDTL Credit Agreement) totaling up to $500 million scheduled to mature on November 15, 2025. Loans under the DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type. We borrowed $500 million under the DDTL Credit Agreement on March 13, 2023, and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the 3.65% $566 million Notes that matured on March 15, 2023.
On March 4, 2022, we completed the redemption of all $450 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.50% Senior Notes due August 2, 2022. The consideration for the redemption was $453 million, including $3 million of premium. We recognized a loss of $4 million (including the $3 million of premium and other costs), which was recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In addition, we paid accrued and unpaid interest on the redeemed notes through the date of settlement. We used a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt to fund the redemption.

26

In March 2021, we repaid our 3.30% $321 million Notes and floating rate $400 million Notes, and in May 2021, we repaid our 8.875% $200 million Notes. The repayments were funded with available cash and commercial paper issuances.
As of July 30, 2023, we had $191 million of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $178 million was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of July 30, 2023, we issued $29 million of standby letters of credit. On September 27, 2021, we entered into a committed revolving credit facility totaling $1.85 billion scheduled to mature on September 27, 2026. This facility remained unused at July 30, 2023, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. The facility contains customary covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the credit facility) of not less than 3.25:1.00, measured quarterly, and customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. Loans under this facility will bear interest at the rates specified in the facility, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other customary conditions. The facility supports our commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements.
On April 4, 2023, we entered into an amendment to our existing revolving credit facility to replace remaining LIBOR-based benchmark rates applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility with SOFR-based benchmark rates, in advance of the cessation of LIBOR occurring on June 30, 2023.
We are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities.
In August 2023, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions.
We intend to finance the pending Sovos Brands acquisition with the issuance of new debt.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
Contractual Obligations
We have short- and long-term material cash requirements related to our contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business. In addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations, our contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase commitments, lease payments and pension and postretirement benefits.
See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our principal payments for short-term borrowings and long-term debt obligations as of July 30, 2023. Interest payments primarily for short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of July 30, 2023 are approximately as follows: $188 million in 2024; $305 million in 2025 through 2026; $218 million in 2027 through 2028; and $1.129 billion from 2029 through maturity. Interest payments are based on principal amounts and coupons or contractual rates at fiscal year end.
Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. As of July 30, 2023, purchase commitments totaled approximately $1.762 billion. Approximately $1.31 billion of these purchase commitments will be settled in the ordinary course of business in the next 12 months and the balance of $452 million from 2025 through 2031.
See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our lease obligations as of July 30, 2023.
As of July 30, 2023, we have a pension liability of $105 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of $153 million. As of July 30, 2023, we also have a pension asset of $164 million based on the funded status of certain plans. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "]:
Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility. Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million "program payment" to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional amounts may become payable by us. In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make s...

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments
We guarantee approximately 4,700 bank loans made to independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $496 million as of July 30, 2023. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.
These obligations and commitments impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY
The principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. We manage our foreign currency exposures by utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and we may utilize interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. We principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, diesel fuel, natural gas, soybean oil, aluminum, cocoa, corn, soybean meal and butter. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments.
The information below summarizes our market risks associated with significant financial instruments as of July 30, 2023. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 12, 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily the Canadian dollar, related to intercompany transactions and third-party transactions. We utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge these exposures. The notional amounts of the contracts as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, were $140 million and $153 million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $1 million as of July 30, 2023, and a gain of $2 million as of July 31, 2022. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in exchange rates would impact the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts by approximately $17 million as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.
As of July 30, 2023, we had outstanding variable-rate debt of $678 million with an average interest rate of 6.18%. As of July 31, 2022, we had outstanding variable-rate debt of $235 million with an average interest rate of 2.63%. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in average interest rates applied to our variable-rate debt balances throughout 2023 and 2022 would have increased annual interest expense in those years by approximately $4 million and $1 million, respectively.
As of July 30, 2023, we had outstanding fixed-rate debt of $4.041 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.79%. As of July 31, 2022, we had outstanding fixed-rate debt of $4.609 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.76%. The fair value of fixed-rate debt was $3.615 billion as of July 30, 2023 and $4.402 billion as of July 31, 2022. As of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $221 million and $274 million, respectively, while a hypothetical 100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $256 million and $318 million, respectively. The impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position.
We enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts, and a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. As of July 30, 2023, the total notional amount of the contracts was $241 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a gain of $11 million. As of July 31, 2022, the total notional amount of these contracts was $296 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $7 million. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices would impact the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts by approximately $25 million as of July 30, 2023, and $30 million as of July 31, 2022, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.
We enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to the total return of certain deferred compensation obligations. The notional amount of the contracts was $42 million as of July 30, 2023, and $50 million as of July 31, 2022. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $4 million as of July 30, 2023, and a loss of $4 million as of July 31, 2022. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in equity price changes would impact the fair value of our outstanding swap contracts by $5 million as of July 30, 2023, and July 31, 2022, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions:

28

Trade and consumer promotion programs — We offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupons. The mix between these forms of variable consideration, which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors, including expected volume. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. Differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates. Accrued trade and consumer promotion liabilities as of July 30, 2023 and July 31, 2022 were $156 million and $141 million, respectively.

Valuation of long-lived assets — Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.
Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill in the reporting unit.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation method based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value.
As of July 30, 2023, the carrying value of goodwill was $3.965 billion. Based on our assessments, all of our reporting units had fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.
As of July 30, 2023, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $2.541 billion as detailed below:

Dividend payments were $447 million in 2023, $451 million in 2022 and $439 million in 2021. Annual dividends declared were $1.48 per share in both 2023 and 2022 and $1.46 per share in 2021. The 2023 fourth quarter dividend was $.37 per share. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
In June 2021, the Board authorized an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million (June 2021 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The June 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the anti-dilutive program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to $500 million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In 2023, we repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of $142 million. Of this amount, $68 million was used to repurchase shares pursuant to our June 2021 program and $74 million was used to repurchase share pursuant to our September 2021 program.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Figma On September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. ("Figma") for approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma's Chief Executive Officer and employees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if the transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it fails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022. Figma is a privately held company that provides a web-first collaborative product design platform. Following the closing, we intend to integrate Figma into our Digital Media reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. Frame.io On October 7, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion, primarily in cash consideration. The financial results of Frame.io have been included in our Consolidated Financial Statements since the date of the acquisition. Frame.io is reported as part of our Digital Media reportable segment. During fiscal 2022, we recorded purchase accounting adjustments that were not material based on changes to management's estimates and assumptions primarily in regards to the total purchase price and its related impact to goodwill.

The estimates of future cash flows used in impairment testing are made at a point in time, involve considerable management judgment, and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, assumed royalty rates, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions. If our assumptions change or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result.
See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.

Pension and postretirement benefits — We provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets.
In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. We use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows.
The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date.
As of July 30, 2023, we have a pension liability of $105 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of $153 million. As of July 30, 2023, we also have a pension asset of $164 million based on the funded status of certain plans.
Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense (income) and actuarial losses (gains) included within net periodic pension and benefit expense (income) were as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- --- - -----
(Millions) 2023 2022 2021
Total net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense (income) $ (22) $ (7) $ (267)
Actuarial losses (gains) $ (15) $ 44 $ (203)

The pension actuarial gains recognized in 2023 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation, partially offset by losses on plan assets and plan experience. The pension actuarial losses recognized in 2022 were primarily due to to losses on plan assets, partially offset by increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation. The pension actuarial gains recognized in 2021 were primarily due to higher than anticipated investment gains on plan assets and increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation.
Excluding actuarial gains and losses, net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income was $44 million lower in 2023 compared to 2022. Based on benefit obligations and plan assets as of July 30, 2023, net periodic pension and postretirement benefit income excluding any actuarial losses or gains is estimated to be approximately $13 million lower in 2024, subject to the impact of interim remeasurements. The decrease in 2024 is primarily due to a lower market value of plan assets.

Significant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:

------------------------------------- ----- ----- -----
 2023 2022 2021
Pension
Discount rate for benefit obligations 5.46% 4.58% 2.69%
Expected return on plan assets 6.38% 6.40% 5.82%
Postretirement
Discount rate for obligations 5.47% 4.48% 2.37%

Based on benefit obligations and plan assets as of July 30, 2023, estimated sensitivities to 2024 annual net periodic pension and postretirement cost are as follows:
•a 50-basis-point increase in the discount rate would result in expense of approximately $5 million and would result in an immediate actuarial gain recognition of approximately $43 million;
•a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would result in income of approximately $5 million and would result in an immediate actuarial loss recognition of approximately $53 million; and
•a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would result in expense of approximately $5 million.
Contributions to pension plans were not material in 2023, 2022 and 2021 and are not expected to be material in 2024.
See also Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits.

Income taxes — The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Ahern Rentals in December 2022. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2022 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rentals. Estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 does not include the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental because the acquisition was completed in 2022. If the pre-acquisition revenue of Ahern Rental was included for 2021, estimated North American market share as of December 31, 2021 would have been approximately 16 percent.
