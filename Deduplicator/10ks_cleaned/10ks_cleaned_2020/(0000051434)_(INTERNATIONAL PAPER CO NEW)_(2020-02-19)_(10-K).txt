Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a description of the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. All segments are differentiated on a common product, common customer basis consistent with the business segmentation generally used in the Forest Products industry.
Business segment operating profits are used by International Paper’s management to measure the earnings performance of its businesses. Management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs, operating efficiencies, prices and volumes. Business segment operating profits are defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity earnings, but including the impact of equity earnings and noncontrolling interests, and excluding interest expense, net, corporate items, net, corporate special items, net, business special items, net, and non-operating pension expense. In 2019, the Company changed its measure of business segment operating profits to exclude items considered by management to be unusual (business special items, net) from the normal operations of the business segment. As a result, all prior periods have been restated to reflect the current measure.
External sales by major product is determined by aggregating sales from each segment based on similar products or services. External sales are defined as those that are made to parties outside International Paper’s consolidated group, whereas sales by segment in the Net Sales table are determined using a management approach and include intersegment sales.

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the measurement date) and considers changes in these long-term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements of employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions. The discount rate assumption was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.

The discount rates used to determine net U.S. and non-U.S. postretirement benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

 2019 2018 2017
------------- --------- ------------- --------- ------------- --------- ------------- ---- - ---- - ----- -
 U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans
Discount rate 4.20 % 9.10 % 3.50 % 9.38 % 4.00 % 10.53 %

The weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

 2019 2018
----------------------------------------------------------- --------- ------------- --------- ------------- ---- - ----- -
 U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans
Discount rate 3.30 % 7.15 % 4.20 % 9.10 %
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.75 % 9.57 % 7.00 % 10.04 %
Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 5.00 % 4.78 % 5.00 % 4.93 %
Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain 2026 2030 2026 2030

The plans are only funded in an amount equal to benefits paid. The following table presents the changes in benefit obligation and plan assets for 2019 and 2018:

The non-current portion of the liability is included with the postemployment liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet under Postretirement and postemployment benefit obligation.

The components of the $18 million and $8 million change in the amounts recognized in OCI during 2019 for U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, consisted of:

The portion of the change in the funded status that was recognized in net periodic benefit cost and OCI for the U.S. plans was $29 million, $(25) million and $25 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The portion of the change in funded status for the non-U.S. plans was $9 million, $5 million, and $3 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

At December 31, 2019, estimated total future postretirement benefit payments, net of participant contributions and estimated future Medicare Part D subsidy receipts, were as follows:

The Agreements include a $1.5 billion contractually committed bank facility that expires in December 2021, and has a facility fee of 0.15% payable annually. The liquidity facilities also include up to $600 million of uncommitted financings based on eligible receivables balances under a receivables securitization program that expires in December 2020. At December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings under either the bank facility or receivables securitization program.The Company’s financial covenants require the maintenance of a minimum net worth, as defined in our debt agreements, of $9 billion and a total debt-to-capital ratio of less than 60%. Net worth is defined as the sum of common stock, paid-in capital and retained earnings, less treasury stock plus any cumulative goodwill impairment charges. The calculation also excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and both the current and long-term Nonrecourse Financial Liabilities of Variable Interest Entities. The total debt-to-capital ratio is defined as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus net worth. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.

International Paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of December 31 (the measurement was determined based on a hypothetical settlement portfolio selected from a universe of high quality corporate bonds.

The discount rates used to determine net U.S. and non-U.S. postretirement benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

 2019 2018 2017
------------- --------- ------------- --------- ------------- --------- ------------- ---- - ---- - ----- -
 U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans
Discount rate 4.20 % 9.10 % 3.50 % 9.38 % 4.00 % 10.53 %

The weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:

 2019 2018
----------------------------------------------------------- --------- ------------- --------- ------------- ---- - ----- -
 U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans U.S.Plans Non-U.S.Plans
Discount rate 3.30 % 7.15 % 4.20 % 9.10 %
Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.75 % 9.57 % 7.00 % 10.04 %
Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 5.00 % 4.78 % 5.00 % 4.93 %
Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain 2026 2030 2026 2030

The plans are only funded in an amount equal to benefits paid. The following table presents the changes in benefit obligation and plan assets for 2019 and 2018:
