ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8. All references to “Tenneco,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” refer to Tenneco Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Notes referenced in this discussion and analysis refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements that are found in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8.

Certain amounts in the prior years have been aggregated or disaggregated to conform to current year presentation as discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Accordingly, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect the effects of these reclassifications.

OVERVIEW
Our Company
We are one of the world’s leading manufacturers of clean air, powertrain and ride performance products and systems for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial, and aftermarket customers. Both original equipment (“OE”) vehicle designers and manufacturers, and the repair and replacement markets, or aftermarket, are served globally through leading brands, including Monroe®, Champion®, Öhlins®, MOOG®, Walker®, Fel-Pro®, Wagner®, Ferodo®, Rancho®, Thrush®, National®, and Sealed Power®, among others. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 201 manufacturing facilities worldwide and employed approximately 78,000 people to service our customers’ demands.

Factors that continue to be critical to our success include winning new business awards, managing our overall global manufacturing footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs, maintaining competitive wages and benefits, maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes, and reducing overall costs. In addition, our ability to adapt to key industry trends, such as a shift in consumer preferences to other vehicles in response to higher fuel costs and other economic and social factors, increasing technologically sophisticated content, changing aftermarket distribution channels, increasing environmental standards and extended product life of automotive parts, also play a critical role in our success. Other factors that are critical to our success include adjusting to economic challenges such as increases in the cost of raw materials and our ability to successfully reduce the effect of any such cost increases through material substitutions, cost reduction initiatives, and other methods.

Öhlins Intressenter AB Acquisition
On January 10, 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 90.5% ownership interest in Öhlins Intressenter AB (the “Öhlins Acquisition”), a Swedish technology company that develops premium suspension systems and components for the automotive and motorsport industries. The purchase price was $162 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

Federal-Mogul Acquisition
On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in Federal-Mogul LLC (the “Federal-Mogul Acquisition”, and together with the Öhlins Acquisition, the “Acquisitions”). Total consideration was approximately $3.7 billion. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

Separation Transaction and Change in Reportable Segments
Following the closing of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to pursue the separation of the combined company. As such, we previously announced our intention to separate our businesses through a spin-off transaction to form two new, independent, publicly traded companies, a new Powertrain Technology company (“New Tenneco”) and an Aftermarket and Ride Performance company (“DRiV”). Current end-market conditions are affecting our ability to complete a separation within our previously announced timeline and we expect these trends will continue throughout this year. During 2020, we will be focused on the execution of our accelerated performance improvement plan (“Accelerate”) to facilitate the expected separation of New Tenneco and DRiV. The Accelerate program is focused on achieving additional cost savings, improving capital efficiency, and reducing leverage. We have made significant progress to facilitate the planned separation of the DRiV business and have completed all necessary system and process components required for New Tenneco and DRiV to operate independently. In this respect, we are ready to separate the businesses as soon as favorable conditions are present. In order to facilitate the separation, we continue to evaluate multiple strategic alternatives, as well as options to deleverage and mitigate the ongoing effect of challenging market conditions.

The future New Tenneco consists of two existing operating segments, Clean Air and Powertrain:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Clean Air segment designs, manufactures, and distributes a variety of products and systems designed to reduce pollution and optimize engine performance, acoustic tuning, and weight on a vehicle for OEMs; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Powertrain segment focuses on original equipment powertrain products for automotive, heavy duty, and industrial applications.

In preparation for the separation, in the first quarter of 2019, we began to manage and report our DRiV businesses through two new operating segments as compared to the three operating segments we had previously reported. The DRiV operating segments are Motorparts and Ride Performance. The new Motorparts operating segment consists of the previously reported Aftermarket operating segment as well as the aftermarket portion of the previously reported Motorparts operating segment. The Ride Performance operating segment consists of the previously reported Ride Performance operating segment as well as the OE Braking business that was included in the previously reported Motorparts operating segment:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Motorparts segment engineers, manufactures, sources, and distributes a broad portfolio of products in the global vehicle aftermarket while also servicing the original equipment and original equipment servicers market with products, including vehicle braking systems and a wide variety of chassis, engine, sealing, wiper, filter, lighting, and other general maintenance applications; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Ride Performance segment designs, manufactures, markets, and distributes a variety of ride performance solutions and systems to a global OE customer base, including noise, vibration, and harshness performance materials, advanced suspension technologies, ride control, and braking.

Costs related to other business activities, primarily corporate headquarter functions, are disclosed separately from the four operating segments as “Corporate.” Prior period operating segment results have been conformed to reflect the Company's current operating segments.

See Note 21, Segment and Geographic Area Information, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2019
Consolidated revenues were $17,450 million, an increase of $5,687 million, or 48%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Acquisitions increased revenues by $5,600 million, or 48%. The remaining increase in revenues was primarily driven by the net favorable effects of organic growth from higher sales volume and mix of $370 million and $27 million in net favorable effects of other, this was partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $310 million.

Cost of sales was $14,912 million, an increase of $4,910 million, or 49%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Acquisitions increased cost of sales by $4,705 million, or 47%. The remaining increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by incremental costs related to higher sales volume and mix of $429 million, the unfavorable effects of material sourcing of $11 million, and an increase in other costs of $1 million, this was partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $236 million.

Net income decreased by $331 million to a net loss of $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to net income of $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) costs, primarily due to the effect of the Acquisitions of $410 million, which was partially offset by a net reduction in SG&A costs of $24 million;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in depreciation and amortization of $328 million primarily due to the Acquisitions;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in engineering, research, and development of $124 million primarily due to the Acquisitions;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in restructuring charges and asset impairments of $9 million;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a goodwill impairment charge of $108 million and impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets of $133 million; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in interest expense and other financing charges of $174 million.

These unfavorable effects were partially offset by:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in equity earnings in nonconsolidated affiliates of $25 million, which was the result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in other income (expense), net of $63 million due primarily to the Acquisitions, a recovery of value-added tax in a foreign jurisdiction, and income from an EPA mandate to which we were the beneficiary; and

- -------------------------------------------------
• a reduction in income tax expense of $44 million.

Recent Trends and Market Conditions
There is inherent uncertainty in the continuation of the trends discussed below. In addition, there may be other factors or trends

that can have an effect on our business. Our business and operating results are affected by the relative strength of:

General economic conditions
Our OE business is directly related to automotive vehicle production by our customers. Automotive production levels depend on a number of factors, including global and regional economic conditions and policies. Demand for aftermarket products is driven by three primary factors: the number of vehicles in operation; the average age of vehicles; and vehicle usage trends (primarily distance traveled).

In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has resulted in plant closures in China, supply chain disruptions, restrictions on travel to China, and a decrease in consumer traffic in China. The coronavirus has spread to multiple countries around the world and we are carefully monitoring the potential impact of the coronavirus in these other countries. The impact to the supply chain as a result of the coronavirus outbreak could further impact production at our and our customers' sites in China, as well as affect production at our and our customers' sites outside of China. We presently believe the impact of lost production in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the coronavirus will be $150 million on value-add revenue and $50 million on EBITDA. However, the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread as of the date of this report and, accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which the coronavirus will ultimately affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Global vehicle production levels

Light vehicle production (According to IHS Markit, January 2020)
For the year ended 2019, global light vehicle production was down across all major markets in which we operate and down 6% overall compared to 2018. North America, South America, and Europe light vehicle production was down 4% in each of the three regions. Production was down 9% in China and 11% in India.

Global light vehicle production in 2020 is expected to decline by 1% overall compared to 2019. Current projections show a marginal 1% improvement in North America and 4% improvement in South America, which are expected to be more than offset by a 2% reduction in Europe, a 1% decrease in China, and a 4% decline in India.

Commercial truck production (According to IHS Markit, February 2020)
Global commercial truck production decreased by 6% for the full year ending December 31, 2019. European commercial truck production fell 6%, China was down 3%, and India had negative growth of 28%. Brazil remained flat in 2019 when compared with the same twelve month period ending December 31, 2018. There was a 2% increase in commercial truck production in our primary market of North America.

Global commercial truck production is expected to continue to decline during 2020, projecting a 9% overall decline compared to 2019. Current 2020 projections for the major markets in which we operate show North America down 17%, Brazil up 6%, Europe down 4%, China down 10%, and India down 14% over 2019.

Revenues
Revenues increased by $5,687 million, or 48%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The Acquisitions increased revenues by $5,600 million, or 48%. The remaining increase in revenues was primarily driven by the net favorable effects of organic growth from higher sales volume and mix of $370 million and $27 million in net favorable effects of other, this was partially offset by the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $310 million.

The following table reflects our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 ($ millions):

------------------------------------------ ----- ------

Year Ended December 31, 2018 $ 11,763

Year Ended December 31, 2019 $ 17,450

Cost of sales
Cost of sales increased by $4,910 million, or 49%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The Acquisitions increased cost of sales by $4,705 million, or 47%. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales remained consistent at 85%. The remaining increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by incremental costs related to higher sales volume and mix of $429 million, the unfavorable effects of material sourcing of $11 million, and an increase in other costs of $1 million, this was partially offset by the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $236 million.

The following table lists the primary drivers behind the change in cost of sales ($ millions):

Currency exchange rates (236 )
Others 1
Year Ended December 31, 2019 $ 14,912

Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A)
SG&A increased by $386 million to $1,138 million compared to $752 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the Acquisitions of $410 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was $127 million of acquisition and expected separation costs, $14 million of costs to achieve synergies, and $15 million of cost reduction initiatives, while the year ended December 31, 2018 included $96 million of acquisition and expected separation costs, $25 million of costs to achieve synergies, $18 million of cost reduction initiatives, and $10 million of litigation settlement.

Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $673 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $345 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $328 million was due primarily to the Acquisitions which added $299 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense in the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, accelerated depreciation expense of $15 million was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 on assets associated with plant closures.

Engineering, research, and development
Engineering, research, and development expense was $324 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $124 million was due primarily to the Acquisitions.

Restructuring charges and asset impairments
Restructuring charges and asset impairments were $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $117 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Costs incurred in each period primarily relate to facility closures and consolidations, and headcount reduction initiatives. Also included in the year ended December 31, 2019 is an $8 million impairment charge incurred on assets held for sale. See Note 4, Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

Table of Contents

Goodwill and intangible impairment charges
Goodwill and intangible impairment charges were $241 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Goodwill impairment charges of $108 million were recorded for three of our reporting units. These charges included $69 million in the Ride Performance segment as a result of our reporting unit reorganization. In addition, as a result of our goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2019, there were two reporting units where their fair values were lower than their carrying values resulting in a $21 million impairment charge in the Motorparts segment and a $18 million impairment charge in the Powertrain segment. This compared to a $3 million goodwill impairment charge in the year ended December 31, 2018, which related to a reporting unit within the Ride Performance segment.

As a result of our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2019, intangible asset impairment charges of $133 million were recorded for two reporting units in the Motorparts segment.

Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs (credits)
Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs decreased by $9 million to $11 million compared to $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This is primarily attributable to a $7 million curtailment gain for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to a curtailment loss of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulting from the plan amendments approved during 2019 to eliminate postretirement benefits for certain nonunion employees.

Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax
Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates, net of tax increased $25 million to $43 million compared to $18 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Loss on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt of $10 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the repayment of our revolver and term loan A and the new refinancing in connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Other income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net increased by $63 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The Acquisitions increased other income (expense), net by $20 million. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to a recovery of value-added tax in a foreign jurisdiction and income from an EPA mandate to which we were the beneficiary.

Interest expense
Interest expense was $322 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations), net of interest capitalized of $5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $148 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations), net of interest capitalized of $5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $174 million increase was primarily due to higher interest expense pertaining to the five-year $1.7 billion term loan A facility and the seven-year $1.7 billion term loan B facility that we entered into in connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition and the interest expense on Federal-Mogul debt obligations assumed.

Interest expense included losses on sales of accounts receivables, which was $31 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $16 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capitalization” later in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Income tax expense (benefit)
Income tax expense was $19 million on loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to income tax expense of $63 million on earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $174 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 included tax benefits of $33 million relating to a valuation allowance release for an entity in Spain. In addition, the Company recorded $22 million of tax expense relating to the goodwill impairment charges and $21 million of tax expense relating to gains on transfers of subsidiaries for entities in China and Luxembourg for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 included tax benefits of $10 million relating to a valuation allowance release for entities in Australia and $11 million of tax expense for changes in the toll tax. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into U.S. law, which, among other provisions, lowered the corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018 from 35% to 21%, and implemented significant changes with respect to U.S. tax treatment of earnings originating from outside the U.S. Based on the new guidance, an $11 million discrete charge was recorded in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Segment Results of Operations

Overview of Net Sales and Operating Revenues
Our Clean Air segment has substrate sales. Substrates are porous ceramic filters coated with a catalyst - typically, precious metals such as platinum, palladium and rhodium. We do not manufacture substrates, they are supplied to us by Tier 2 suppliers generally directed by our OE customers. We generally earn a small margin on these components of the system. These substrate components have been increasing as a percentage of our revenue as the need for more sophisticated emission control solutions increases to meet more stringent environmental regulations, and as we capture more diesel aftertreatment business. While these substrates dilute our gross margin percentage, they are a necessary component of an emission control system.

Our value-add content in an emission control system includes designing the system to meet environmental regulations through integration of the substrates into the system, maximizing use of thermal energy to heat up the catalyst quickly, efficiently managing airflow to reduce back pressure as the exhaust stream moves past the catalyst, managing the expansion and contraction of the emission control system components due to temperature extremes experienced by an emission control system, using advanced acoustic engineering tools to design the desired exhaust sound, minimizing the opportunity for the fragile components of the substrate to be damaged when we integrate it into the emission control system and reducing unwanted noise, vibration, and harshness transmitted through the emission control system.

We disclose substrate sales amounts because we believe investors utilize this information to understand the effect of this portion of our revenues on our overall business and because it removes the effect of potentially volatile precious metals pricing from our revenues. While our OE customers generally assume the risk of precious metals pricing volatility, it affects our reported revenues.

Segment Revenue
Clean Air
Clean Air revenue increased $414 million to $7,121 million compared to $6,707 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Higher light vehicle and commercial truck revenues, offset partially by lower off highway and other vehicle revenues, resulted in a favorable $606 million effect on revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019. Foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable effect of $181 million on Clean Air revenues, leaving a net unfavorable $11 million of other.

Powertrain
Powertrain full year revenue was $4,408 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1,112 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. The difference of $3,296 million was primarily attributable to a full year of operations for the Powertrain segment as a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Ride Performance
Ride Performance revenue increased $590 million to $2,754 million compared to $2,164 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Acquisitions increased revenue by $686 million. The remaining decrease of $96 million was due to lower volume and unfavorable mix, particularly in North America of $27 million, and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $75 million.

Motorparts
Motorparts revenue increased $1,387 million to $3,167 million compared to $1,780 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Federal-Mogul Acquisition increased revenue by $1,524 million. The remaining decrease of $137 million was due to lower volumes and unfavorable mix of $132 million and unfavorable foreign currency exchange of $42 million, which was partially offset by favorable other of $37 million.

EBITDA including noncontrolling interests by Segment:
Clean Air $ 582 $ 599 $ (17 )
Powertrain $ 363 $ 93 $ 270
Ride Performance $ 8 $ 69 $ (61 )
Motorparts $ 184 $ 161 $ 23

Clean Air
Clean air EBITDA including noncontrolling interest decreased $17 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower volume and unfavorable mix and unfavorable performance, partially offset by lower selling, general, and administrative costs and improved operating efficiencies.

Powertrain
As a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, full year Powertrain EBITDA including noncontrolling interests was $363 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Included in year ended December 31, 2019 was an $18 million goodwill impairment charge recorded as a result of the annual goodwill impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Ride Performance
Ride Performance EBITDA including noncontrolling interests decreased $61 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. While the Acquisitions contributed $15 million of additional EBITDA including noncontrolling interests, this increase is more than offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $69 million taken in the year ended December 31, 2019 as a result of our operating segment reorganization. Also contributing to the decrease in EBITDA including noncontrolling interests was net unfavorable volume and mix, less favorable operating performance, and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency. These were partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative costs. The amounts discussed above include an immaterial $5 million charge related to a prior period recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Motorparts
Motorparts EBITDA including noncontrolling interests increased $23 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The Federal-Mogul Acquisition contributed $214 million of EBITDA including noncontrolling interests to Motorparts in

the year ended December 31, 2019. This was partially offset by a $21 million goodwill impairment charge and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The remaining decrease included the net unfavorable effects of volume and mix, the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, less favorable operating performance, incremental costs associated with a warranty charge, and costs associated with process harmonization.

The EBITDA including noncontrolling interests results shown in the preceding table include the following items, certain of which may have an effect on the comparability of EBITDA including noncontrolling interests results between periods.

Revenues
Revenues increased by $2,489 million, or 27%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The Federal-Mogul Acquisition increased revenues by $1,886 million, or 20%. The remaining increase in revenues was primarily driven by the net favorable effects of organic growth from higher sales volume and mix of $597 million and the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $12 million, this was partially offset by a net unfavorable other of $6 million.

Cost of sales
Cost of sales increased by $2,231 million, or 29%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The effect of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition increased cost of sales by $1,637 million, or 21%. The remaining increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by incremental costs related to higher sales volume and mix of $556 million, unfavorable materials sourcing of $13 million, an increase in other costs of $19 million, and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $6 million.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
SG&A increased by $120 million to $752 million compared to $632 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. Included in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $96 million of acquisition and expected separation costs, $25 million of cost to achieve synergies, $18 million of cost reduction initiatives, and $10 million related to a litigation settlement, while the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $132 million antitrust settlement accrual and $22 million in cost reduction initiatives.

Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $345 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $226 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Engineering, research, and development
Engineering, research, and development expense was $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Restructuring charges and asset impairments
Restructuring charges and asset impairments were $117 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Costs incurred in each period primarily relate to facility closures. See Note 4, Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

Goodwill impairment charges
As a result of our goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined the fair value of one of our reporting units in the Ride Performance segment was lower than its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. This compared to an $11 million goodwill impairment related to our Ride Performance segment in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs (credits)
Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs was up $4 million to $20 million compared to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Loss on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt was $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the repayment of our revolver and term loan A and the new refinancing in connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. This compared to a $1 million charge recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Interest expense
Interest expense was $148 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $77 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $71 million increase was primarily due to higher interest expense pertaining to the five-year $1.7 billion term loan A facility and the seven-year $1.7 billion term loan B facility that were entered into in

connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition and the interest expense on Federal-Mogul debt obligations assumed, partially offset by the lower interest expense as a result of the retirement of the Company's term loan A and revolver borrowings on October 1, 2018 related to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Interest expense included losses on sales of accounts receivables, which was $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Capitalization” later in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.

Income tax expense (benefit)
We reported income tax expense of $63 million on earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $174 million in 2018, as compared to income tax expense of $71 million on earnings before income taxes and noncontrolling interests of $336 million in 2017. The tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018 included tax benefits of $10 million relating to a valuation allowance release for entities in Australia and $11 million of tax expense for changes in the toll tax. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into U.S. law, which, among other provisions, lowered the corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018 from 35% to 21%, and implemented significant changes with respect to U.S. tax treatment of earnings originating from outside the U.S. Based on the new guidance, an $11 million discrete charge was recorded in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Net income (loss)
Net income was $111 million for 2018 as compared to $265 million for 2017, a decrease of $154 million, as result of the aforementioned items.

Segment Revenue
Clean Air
Clean Air revenue increased $491 million to $6,707 million in 2018 compared to $6,216 million in 2017. Higher volumes drove a $486 million increase due to higher light vehicle revenues, higher commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle sales, as well as new platforms. Currency had a $45 million favorable effect on Clean Air revenues.

Powertrain
As a result of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, Powertrain revenue was $1,112 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Ride Performance
Ride Performance revenue increased $357 million to $2,164 million in 2018 compared to $1,807 million in 2017. The increase in revenues is partly due to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. Higher volumes drove a $138 million increase due to increased light vehicle and commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicles and new platforms. Currency had a $4 million unfavorable effect on Ride Performance revenues.

Motorparts
Motorparts revenue increased $529 million to $1,780 million in 2018 compared to $1,251 million in 2017. The increase in revenues is partly due to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. Offsetting the increase due to the acquisition was lower volumes and unfavorable mix and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $29 million.

Short-term debt, which primarily includes borrowings by the parent company and foreign subsidiaries was $185 million and $153 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. We had borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $183 million, which were classified as long-term debt, at December 31, 2019 and no borrowings at December 31, 2018.

The 2019 year-to-date decrease in our shareholders' equity primarily resulted from a net loss of $334 million and an increase in other comprehensive loss of $45 million as a result of the year-end remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. This was partially offset by an increase in additional paid-in capital for a redeemable noncontrolling interest transaction with one of our owners of $53 million and the favorable effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the operations of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars of $26 million.

On October 1, 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and other lenders (the “New Credit Facility”) in connection with the acquisition of Federal-Mogul, which has been amended by the first amendment, dated February 14, 2020 (the “First Amendment”), and by the second amendment, dated February 14, 2020 (the “Second Amendment”). The New Credit Facility consists of $4.9 billion of total debt financing, consisting of a five-year $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, a five-year $1.7 billion term loan A facility (“Term Loan A”) and a seven-year $1.7 billion term loan B facility (“Term Loan B”). We paid $8 million in one-time fees in connection with the First Amendment and Second Amendment.

Proceeds from the New Credit Facility were used to finance the cash consideration portion of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition purchase price, to refinance our then existing senior credit facilities, inclusive of the revolver and the tranche term loan A then outstanding (the “Old Credit Facility”), certain senior credit facilities of Federal-Mogul, to pay fees and expenses related to the

acquisition, and the financing thereof. The remainder, including future borrowings under the revolving credit facility, will be used for general corporate purposes.

We and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tenneco Automotive Operating Company Inc., are borrowers under the New Credit Facility, and we are the sole borrower under the Term Loan A and Term Loan B facilities. The New Credit Facility is guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of our material domestic subsidiaries. Drawings under the revolving credit facility may be in U.S. dollars, British pounds or euros.

The New Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our domestic assets, our subsidiary guarantors, and by pledges of up to 66% of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries. The security for the New Credit Facility is pari passu with the security for the outstanding senior secured notes of Federal-Mogul that we assumed in connection with the acquisition. If any of our foreign subsidiaries is added to the revolving credit facility as a borrower, the obligations of such foreign borrower will be secured by the assets of such foreign borrower, and also will be secured by the assets of, and guaranteed by, the domestic borrowers and domestic guarantors as well as certain of our foreign subsidiaries in the chain of ownership of such foreign borrower.

As a result of the refinancing of the revolving credit loan and tranche A term loan under the Old Credit Facility, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily consisting of debt issuance costs incurred at the transaction date and write-off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the refinanced revolving credit loan and tranche A term loan. We also recorded $1 million of loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to amendment and restatement of the Old Credit Facility and the write off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Old Credit Facility.

New Credit Facility - Interest Rates and Fees
At December 31, 2019, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility was initially LIBOR plus 1.75%, and would change to 1.50% if our consolidated net leverage ratio were less than 2.5 to 1 and greater than or equal to 1.5 to 1, and would change to 1.25% if the net leverage ratio were less than 1.5 to 1. After giving effect to the First Amendment, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility increased from LIBOR plus 1.75% to LIBOR plus 2.00% and will remain at LIBOR plus 2.00% for each relevant period for which Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1. The First Amendment does not change the step-down of the interest rate at lower consolidated net leverage ratios, which steps down to (a) LIBOR plus 1.75% if the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio is less than 3.0 to 1 and greater than or equal to 2.5 to 1, (b) LIBOR plus 1.50% if the consolidated net leverage ratio is less than 2.5 to 1 and greater than or equal to 1.5 to 1, and (c) LIBOR plus 1.25% if the consolidated net leverage ratio is less than 1.5 to 1.

Initially, and so long as our corporate family rating is Ba3 (with a stable outlook) or higher from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and BB- (with a stable outlook) or higher from Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), the interest rate on borrowings under the Term Loan B facility will be LIBOR plus 2.75%; at any time the foregoing conditions are not satisfied, the interest rate on the Term Loan B facility will be LIBOR plus 3.00%. When the Term Loan B facility is no longer outstanding and we and our subsidiaries have no other secured indebtedness (with certain exceptions set forth in the New Credit Facility), and upon our achieving and maintaining two or more corporate credit and/or corporate family ratings higher than or equal to BBB- from S&P, BBB- from Fitch Ratings Inc. (“Fitch”) and/or Baa3 from Moody’s (in each case, with a stable or positive outlook), the collateral under the New Credit Facility may be released. On June 3, 2019, Moody’s lowered our corporate family rating to B1 and the interest rate on borrowings under the term loan B was raised to LIBOR plus 3.00%.

New Credit Facility - Other Terms and Conditions
The New Credit Facility contains representations and warranties, and covenants which are customary for debt facilities of this type. The covenants limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, to (i) incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders, (iii) purchase or redeem our equity interests, (iv) make investments, (v) create liens on our assets, (vi) enter into transactions with our affiliates, (vii) sell assets and (viii) merge or consolidate with, or dispose of substantially all of our assets to, other companies. The First Amendment further tightened the restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our stockholders, to make investments and to increase the size of the revolving credit facility, the term loan A facility or the term Loan B facility. The Second Amendment provided greater flexibility for us to apply, at our discretion, the net cash proceeds from a spin-off of DRiV to prepay the senior secured notes, Term Loan A or Term Loan B (subject to the terms of the senior note indentures).

Table of Contents

The New Credit Facility includes customary events of default and other provisions that could require all amounts due thereunder to become immediately due and payable, either automatically or at the option of the lenders, if we fail to comply with the terms of the New Credit Facility or if other customary events occur.

The New Credit Facility also contains two financial maintenance covenants for the revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A facility. At December 31, 2019, these financial maintenance covenants include (i) a requirement to have a consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) as of the end of each fiscal quarter of not greater than 4.0 to 1 through September 30, 2019, 3.75 to 1 through September 30, 2020 and 3.5 to 1 thereafter; and (ii) a requirement to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of not less than 2.75 to 1. After giving effect to the First Amendment, these financial maintenance covenants include (i) a requirement to have a consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) as of the end of each fiscal quarter of not greater than 4.50 to 1 through March 31, 2021, 4.25 to 1 through September 30, 2021, 4.00 to 1 through March 31, 2022, 3.75 to 1 through September 30, 2022, and 3.5 to 1 thereafter; and (ii) a requirement to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the New Credit Facility) for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of not less than 2.75 to 1.

The financial ratios required under the New Credit Facility and the actual ratios we calculated as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: leverage ratio of 3.46 and 2.74 actual versus 3.75 (maximum) required; and interest coverage ratio of 5.38 and 6.50 actual versus 2.75 (minimum) required.

The covenants in our New Credit Facility generally prohibit us from repaying or refinancing certain subordinated indebtedness. So long as no default exists, we would, however, under our New Credit Facility, be permitted to repay or refinance subordinated indebtedness (i) with the net cash proceeds of permitted refinancing indebtedness (as defined in the New Credit Facility); (ii) in an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of qualified capital stock (as defined in the New Credit Facility) issued after October 1, 2018 and (iii) in exchange for qualified capital stock issued after October 1, 2018; or (iv) with additional payments provided that such additional payments are subject to compliance with the consolidated leverage ratio set forth below after giving effect to such additional payments. Prior to the effectiveness of the First Amendment, the amount of such additional payments in respect of subordinated debt were capped as set forth below:

------------------------------------- ----------------- --- ------------- --------- -----------------------------------------------

Pro forma Consolidated Leverage Ratio Prior to Spin-Off Post Spin-Off
 (millions)
Greater than 2.25x $ 360 $360 x Post Spin-Off EBITDA/Pre Spin-Off EBITDA
Equal to or less than 2.25x unlimited unlimited

After giving effect to the First Amendment, such additional payments on subordinated indebtedness (x) will no longer be permitted at any time the pro forma consolidated leverage ratio is greater than 2.00 to 1 after giving effect to such additional payments and (y) will be permitted in an unlimited amount at any time the pro forma consolidated leverage ratio is equal to or less than 2.00 to 1 after giving effect to such additional payments.

Although the New Credit Facility agreement would permit us to repay or refinance our senior notes under certain conditions, any repayment or refinancing of our outstanding notes would be subject to market conditions and either the voluntary participation of note holders or our ability to redeem the notes under the terms of the applicable note indenture. For example, while the New Credit Facility agreement would allow us to repay our outstanding notes via a direct exchange of the notes for either permitted refinancing indebtedness or for shares of our common stock, we do not, under the terms of the agreements governing our outstanding notes, have the right to refinance the notes via any type of direct exchange.

The New Credit Facility agreement also contains other restrictions on our operations that are customary for similar facilities, including limitations on: (i) incurring additional liens; (ii) sale and leaseback transactions (except for the permitted transactions as described in the New Credit Facility agreement); (iii) liquidations and dissolutions; (iv) incurring additional indebtedness or guarantees; (v) investments and acquisitions; (vi) dividends and share repurchases; (vii) mergers and consolidations; and (viii) refinancing of the senior notes. Compliance with these requirements and restrictions is a condition for any incremental borrowings under the New Credit Facility agreement and failure to meet these requirements enables the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans.

At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all the financial covenants and operational restrictions of the New Credit Facility.

Senior Unsecured Notes
At December 31, 2019, we have outstanding our 5.375% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2024 (“2024 Senior Notes”) and 5% senior unsecured notes due July 15, 2026 (“2026 Senior Notes” and together with the 2024 Senior Notes, the “Senior Unsecured Notes”). Under the indentures covering the Senior Unsecured Notes, we are permitted to redeem some or all of the outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes, at specified redemption prices that decline to par over a specified period, at any time (a) on or after December 15, 2019, in the case of the 2024 Senior Notes and (b) on or after July 15, 2021, in the case of the 2026 Senior Notes. In addition, the Senior Unsecured Notes may also be redeemed at any time at a redemption price generally equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a “make-whole premium” as set forth in the indentures. We did not redeem any of the Senior Unsecured Notes during the year ended December 31, 2019.

If we experience specified kinds of changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the Senior Unsecured Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if we sell certain of our assets and do not apply the proceeds from the sale in a certain manner within 365 days of the sale, we must use such unapplied sales proceeds to make an offer to repurchase the 2024 Senior Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Senior Secured Notes
In connection with the Acquisition of Federal-Mogul, we assumed (i) €350 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% euro denominated secured due July 15, 2024 (“5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes”), (ii) €415 million aggregate principle amount of 4.875% euro denominated senior secured fixed rate notes due April 15, 2022 (“4.875% Euro Fixed Rate Notes”), and (iii) €300 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior secured notes due April 15, 2024 (“Euro Floating Rate Notes,” and together with the 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the 4.875% Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the “Senior Secured Notes”) which were outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Senior Secured Notes are secured equally and ratably by a pledge of substantially all the Company's subsidiaries’ domestic assets and by pledges of up to 66% of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries. The security for the Senior Secured Notes is pari passu with the security for the New Credit Facility.

We are permitted to redeem some or all of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes at specified redemption prices that decline to par over a specified period, at any time (a) on or after July 15, 2020, in the case of the 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes, (b) on or after April 15, 2019, in the case of the 4.875% Euro Fixed Rate Notes and (c) on or after April 15, 2018, in the case of the Euro Floating Rate Notes. Prior to July 15, 2020, we may also redeem the 5.00% Euro Fixed Rate Notes at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a “make-whole premium” as set forth in the indenture. Further, we may also redeem up to 40% of the 5.000% Euro Fixed Rate Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at any time prior to July 15, 2020 at a redemption price of 105.0% of the principle amount thereto.

If we experience specified kinds of changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if we sell certain of our assets and do not apply the proceeds from the sale in a certain manner within 365 days of the sale, we must use such unapplied sales proceeds to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We have designated a portion of the Senior Secured Notes as a net investment hedge of our European operations. As such, the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the value of the designated Senior Secured Notes is recorded to cumulative translation adjustment. See Note 9, Derivatives and Hedging Activities for further details.

Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes - Other Terms and Conditions
Our Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that will, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to create liens on their assets and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, the indentures governing our Senior Secured Notes and 2024 Senior Unsecured Notes contain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions to the holders of our capital stock; (iii) repurchase our capital stock; (iv) make investments; (v) sell assets; and (vi) undertake mergers and consolidations.

Subject to limited exceptions, all of our existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee our Senior Unsecured Notes and Senior Secured Notes on a joint and several basis. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries that have guaranteed these notes to make distributions to us.

As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants and restrictions of these indentures.

Other Debt
Other debt consists primarily of subsidiary debt.

On-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have securitization programs for some of our accounts receivable, with limited recourse provisions. Borrowings on these securitization programs are recorded in short-term debt.

Borrowings on these securitization programs at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

------------------------------------- ----------------- - ---- - -

 As of December 31
 2019 2018
 (millions)
Borrowings on securitization programs $ 4 $ 6

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
On December 14, 2017, we entered into a new accounts receivable factoring program in the U.S. with a commercial bank. Under this program we sell receivables from certain of our U.S. OE customers at a rate that is favorable versus our senior credit facility. This arrangement is uncommitted and provides for cancellation by the commercial bank with no less than 30 days prior written notice. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our accounts receivable sold under this program was $222 million and $130 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

The Company has two other receivable factoring programs in the U.S. with commercial banks under which we sell receivables from certain of our aftermarket customers to whom we have extended payment terms. Both arrangements are uncommitted and may be terminated with 10 days prior notice for one program and 30 days prior notice for the other program. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our accounts receivable sold under these programs was $336 million and $387 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

The Company also has subsidiaries in several countries in Europe that are parties to accounts receivable factoring facilities. The commitments for these arrangements are generally for one year, but some may be canceled with notice 90 days prior to renewal. In some instances, the arrangement provides for cancellation by the applicable financial institution at any time upon notification. The amount of outstanding third-party investments in our accounts receivable sold under programs in Europe was $289 million and $361 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

These factoring programs provide us with access to cash at costs that are generally favorable to alternative sources of financing, and allow us to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. If we were not able to factor receivables under either the European or U.S. programs, our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement might increase, although this could be partially mitigated by exercising our right to shorten payment terms with certain of the aftermarket customers whose receivables we sell under the U.S. factoring programs in the event that those factoring programs are terminated.

Table of Contents

In the U.S and Canada, we participate in supply chain financing programs with certain of our aftermarket customers to whom we have extended payment terms whereby the accounts receivable are satisfied through the early receipt of negotiable financial instruments that are payable at a later date when payments from our customers are due. We sell these financial instruments before their maturity date to various financial institutions at a discount. Such financial instruments sold to financial institutions with outstanding maturity dates totaled $190 million and $133 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

If these supply chain financing programs with our participating aftermarket customers were terminated or the financial institutions that currently participate in these programs were to reduce their purchases, our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement might increase, although this could be partially mitigated by exercising our right to shorten payment terms with certain of the aftermarket customers whose accounts receivable we sell under the U.S. and Canadian programs in the event that those programs are terminated or otherwise reduced.

The amount of accounts receivable outstanding and derecognized for these factoring and drafting arrangements was $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. In addition, the outstanding deferred purchase price receivable was $33 million and $24 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Proceeds from the factoring of accounts receivable qualifying as sales and drafting programs was $5.0 billion, $3.4 billion, and $2.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

Expenses associated with these arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 are as follows:

------------------------------- ---------------------- -- ---- ---- -- - -

 Year Ended December 31
 2019 2018 2017
 (millions)
Loss on sale of receivables (a) $ 31 $ 16 $ 5

(a) Included in interest expense within the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Supply Chain Financing
Certain of our suppliers in the U.S. participate in supply chain financing programs under which they securitize their accounts receivables from us. Financial institutions participate in the supply chain financing programs on an uncommitted basis and can cease purchasing receivables or drafts from our suppliers at any time. If the financial institutions did not continue to purchase receivables or drafts from our suppliers under these programs, the participating vendors may have a need to renegotiate their payment terms with us which in turn could cause our borrowings under our revolving credit facility to increase. The amount of outstanding accounts receivables and drafts sold by our suppliers under these programs were $33 million and $54 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018. We are in the process of winding down these programs and expect to end them by mid-2020.

Capital Requirements
We believe that cash flows from operations, combined with our cash on hand, subject to any applicable withholding taxes upon repatriation of cash balances from our foreign operations where most of our cash balances are located, and available borrowing capacity described above, assuming that we maintain compliance with the financial covenants and other requirements of the New Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements, including debt amortization, capital expenditures, pension contributions, and other operational requirements, for the following year. Our ability to meet the financial covenants depends upon a number of operational and economic factors, many of which are beyond our control. In the event that we are unable to meet these financial covenants, we would consider several options to meet our cash flow needs. Such actions include additional restructuring initiatives and other cost reductions, sales of assets, reductions to working capital and capital spending, issuance of equity and other alternatives to enhance our financial and operating position. Should we be required to implement any of these actions to meet our cash flow needs, we believe we can do so in a reasonable time frame.

Cash Flows

Operating Activities
As summarized in the table below, net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------- --- ---- ---- ---- --- --- - - ---

 Year Ended December 31

Total change in operating assets and liabilities (88 ) 6 15
Net cash provided (used) by operating activities $ 444 $ 439 $ 517

Cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The net increase was primarily the result of:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an improvement in operational cash flow before changes in operating assets and liabilities of $99 million resulting from the full year inclusion of the operating results of Federal-Mogul; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• offset by an increase in cash used by working capital of $94 million. The $94 million decrease in working capital items was primarily driven by an increase in factored receivables that are shown as proceeds from deferred purchase price of factored receivables in the investing activities, partially offset by a reduction of inventory levels.

Cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $78 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The net decrease was primarily the result of:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• cash flows provided by the operations of Federal-Mogul, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2018, of approximately $234 million, this included a cash outflow of $61 million related to the settlement of a litigation matter that was assumed as part of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition (see Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures for further information);

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• offset by a $88 million outflow in working capital items (excluding changes in working capital of the acquired Federal-Mogul operations);

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• an increase in cash payments for interest of $36 million; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• other one-time charges of approximately $180 million, including, among other items, transactional related costs and advisory fees in connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, and an antitrust settlement payment.

Capital expenditures were $744 million, $507 million, and $419 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. These capital expenditures were primarily related to investing in new facilities, upgrading existing products, continuing new product launches, and infrastructure and equipment at our facilities (including investments in software-related intangible assets) to support our manufacturing, distribution, and cost reduction efforts. For 2020, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $610 million and $650 million, depending on timing of expenditures, as we continue to invest in our strategic priorities and growth.

Proceeds from deferred purchase price of factored receivables was $250 million, $174 million, and $112 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. This increase in 2019 as compared to 2018 is primarily attributable to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Table of Contents

Cash flow provided by financing activities was $2,476 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. On October 1, 2018, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $3,400 million as a part of our New Credit Facility, entered into in conjunction with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. As a part of this New Credit facility we refinanced the revolving credit agreement and tranche A term loan under the Old Credit facility. This included borrowings under term loans of $3,426 million, repayments of term loans of $453 million, and net repayments under revolving lines of credit of $256 million. We also had distributions to noncontrolling interest partners of $51 million.

Cash flow used in financing activities was $251 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This included $160 million borrowings under term loans and $36 million repayment of terms loans. We also had distributions to noncontrolling interest partners of $64 million.

We did not repurchase any shares during 2019 or 2018. During 2017, we repurchased 2,936,950 shares of our outstanding common stock for $169 million at an average price of $57.57 per share. In February 2017, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock over the next three years. This amount includes the remaining $112 million amount authorized under earlier repurchase programs. The remaining $231 million authorized for share repurchases in the 2017 Program expired on December 31, 2019.

Borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $183 million at December 31, 2019. In addition, we had $4 million and $6 million borrowed under our accounts receivable securitization programs at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Dividends on Common Stock
We suspended the quarterly dividend in the second quarter of 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid dividends of $0.25 per share, or $20 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid dividends of $0.25 per share in each of the quarters, or $59 million in the aggregate. Our dividend program and the payment of any future cash dividends are subject to continued capital availability, the judgment of our Board of Directors and our continued compliance with the provisions pertaining to the payment of dividends under our debt agreements.

Contractual Obligations
Our remaining required debt principal amortization and payment obligations under lease and certain other financial commitments as of December 31, 2019 are shown in the following table:

If we do not maintain compliance with the terms of our New Credit Facility or senior notes indentures described above, all amounts under those arrangements could, automatically or at the option of the lenders or other debt holders, become due. Additionally, each of those facilities contains provisions that certain events of default under one facility will constitute a default under the other facility, allowing the acceleration of all amounts due. We currently expect to maintain compliance with the terms of all of our various credit agreements for the foreseeable future.

Included in our contractual obligations is the amount of interest to be paid on our long-term debt. As our debt structure contains both fixed and variable rate obligations, we have made assumptions in calculating the amount of future interest payments. Interest on our Senior Unsecured Notes is calculated using the fixed rates of 5.375% and 5.000%, and interest on our fixed rate Senior Secured Notes is calculated using the fixed rates of 4.875% and 5.000%. Interest on our variable rate debt is calculated as LIBOR plus the applicable margin in effect at December 31, 2019 for our term loans, and Euribor plus the applicable margin in effect at December 31, 2019 for our floating rate euro notes. We have assumed that both LIBOR and the Euribor rates will remain unchanged for the outlying years.

We have also included an estimate of expenditures required after December 31, 2019 to complete the projects authorized at December 31, 2019, in which we have made substantial commitments in connection with purchasing property, plant and equipment for our operations. For 2020, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $610 million and $650 million.

We have included an estimate of the expenditures necessary after December 31, 2019 to satisfy purchase requirements pursuant to certain ordinary course supply agreements that we have entered into. With respect to our other supply agreements, they generally do not specify the volumes we are required to purchase. In many cases, if any commitment is provided, the agreements state only the minimum percentage of our purchase requirements we must buy from the supplier. As a result, these purchase obligations fluctuate from year-to-year and we are not able to quantify the amount of our future obligations.

We have not included material cash requirements for unrecognized tax benefits or taxes. It is difficult to estimate taxes to be paid as changes in where we generate income can have a significant effect on our future tax payments. We have also not included cash requirements for funding pension and postretirement benefit costs. Based upon current estimates, we believe we will be required to make contributions of approximately $117 million to those plans in 2020. Pension and postretirement contributions beyond 2020 will be required but those amounts will vary based upon many factors, including the performance of its pension fund investments during 2020 and future discount rate changes. For additional information relating to the funding of our pension and other postretirement plans, see Note 13, Pension Plans, Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information. In addition, we have not included cash requirements for environmental remediation. Based upon current estimates, we believe we will be required to spend approximately $40 million over the next 30 years. However, due to possible modifications in remediation processes and other factors, it is difficult to determine the actual timing of the payments. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

We occasionally provide guarantees that could require it to make future payments in the event that the third-party primary obligor does not make its required payments. The Company is not required to record a liability for any of these guarantees.

Additionally, we have from time to time issued guarantees for the performance of obligations by some of our subsidiaries, and some of our subsidiaries have guaranteed our debt. All of our existing and future material domestic subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee its New Credit Facility and its senior notes on a joint and several basis. The New Credit Facility is also secured by first-priority liens on substantially all our domestic assets and pledges of up to 66% of the stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries. As described above, certain of our senior notes are secured by pledges of stock and assets.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ from our estimates. Our significant accounting policies have been disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas where estimates are required.

Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
We evaluate goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate goodwill might be impaired. We perform assessments at the reporting unit level by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. If the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds the fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired. Our assessment of fair value utilizes a combination of the income approach, market approach, and, in instances where a reporting unit's free cash flows do not support the value of the underlying assets, an asset approach. In our assessment, for reporting units where the free cash flows support the value of the underlying assets, we apply a 75% weighting to the income approach and a 25% weighting to the market approach. The most significant inputs in estimating the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach are (i) projected operating margins, (ii) the revenue growth rate, and (iii) the discount rate, which is risk-adjusted based on the aforementioned inputs.

Similar to goodwill, we evaluate our indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicated the assets might be impaired. We perform a quantitative assessment of estimating fair values based upon the prospective stream of hypothetical after-tax royalty cost savings discounted at rates that reflect the rates of return appropriate for these intangible assets. The primary, and most sensitive, inputs utilized in determining fair values of trade names and trademarks are (i) projected branded product sales, (ii) the revenue growth rate, (iii) the royalty rate, and (iv) the discount rate, which is risk-adjusted based on the projected branded sales.

The basis of the goodwill impairment and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses is our annual budget and three-year strategic plan. This includes a projection of future cash flows based on new products, awarded business, customer commitments, and independent market data, which requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows and revenue growth rates. These estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.

While we believe the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable, due to the many variables inherent in estimating fair value and the relative size of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the results of our analysis. Refer to Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information regarding our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets
We monitor our long-lived and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment indicators on an on-going basis. If impairment indicators exist, we perform the required impairment analysis by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset groups to the related net book values. If the net book value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized. Even if an impairment charge is not recognized, a reassessment of the useful lives over which depreciation or amortization is being recognized may be appropriate based on our assessment of the recoverability of these assets.

We estimate cash flows and fair value using internal budgets based on recent sales data, new products, awarded business, customer commitments, and independent market data. The key factors that affect our estimates are (1) future production estimates; (2) customer preferences and decisions; (3) product pricing; (4) manufacturing and material cost estimates; and (5) product life / business retention. Any differences in actual results from the estimates could result in fair values different from the estimated fair values, which could materially affect our future results of operations and financial condition. We believe the projections of anticipated future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable; however, changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect our valuations.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits
The Company sponsors defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans for certain employees and retirees around the world. Its defined benefit plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions,

73

Table of Contents

including an expected long-term rate of return, discount rate, mortality rates of participants, expected rates of mortality improvement, and health care cost trend rates.

The approach to establishing the discount rate assumption for both our domestic and international plans is based on high-quality corporate bonds. The weighted-average discount rates used to calculate net periodic benefit cost for 2019 and year-end obligations as of December 31, 2019 were as follows:

------------------------------------------- ---------------- - -------------------- --- -------- --- -

 Pension Benefits Other Postretirement
 U.S. Non-U.S.
 Plans Plans Benefits
Used to calculate net periodic benefit cost 4.2 % 2.6 % 4.3 %
Used to calculate benefit obligations 3.2 % 1.7 % 3.2 %

Our approach to determining expected return on plan asset assumptions evaluates both historical returns as well as estimates of future returns, and is adjusted for any expected changes in the long-term outlook for the equity and fixed income markets and for changes in the composition of pension plan assets. As a result, our estimate of the weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets for all of our pension plans increased to 5.4% in 2019 from 5.2% in 2018.

Our pension plans generally do not require employee contributions. Our policy is to fund these pension plans in accordance with applicable domestic and international government regulations. At December 31, 2019, all legal funding requirements had been met.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations. The changes in these assumptions have no effect on our funding requirements.

Refer to Note 13, Pension Plans, Postretirement and Other Employee Benefits, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information regarding our pension and other postretirement employee benefit costs and assumptions.

Warranty Reserves
Where we have offered product warranty and also provide for warranty costs. Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold or when specific warranty issues are identified on OE products. These estimates are established using historical information about the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims and upon specific warranty issues as they arise. The warranty terms vary but range from one year up to limited lifetime warranties on some of our premium aftermarket products. While we have not experienced any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs, it is reasonably possible that future warranty issues could arise that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities which reflect the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax reporting values. Future tax benefits of net operating losses (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets on a taxing jurisdiction basis. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid. Changes in tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded deferred taxes in future periods.

Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The ability to realize deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each tax jurisdiction. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets.  We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowance balances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be materially different from the current estimate. Refer to Note 14, Income Taxes, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

In addition, the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to complexity of some of these uncertainties and the effect of any tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may be materially different from our estimated liabilities.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY
We are exposed to certain global market risks, including foreign currency exchange risk, commodity price risk, interest rate risk associated with our debt, and equity price risk associated with our share-based compensation awards.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We manufacture and sell our products in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we manufacture and sell our products. We generally try to use natural hedges within our foreign currency activities, including the matching of revenues and costs, to minimize foreign currency risk. Where natural hedges are not in place, we consider managing certain aspects of our foreign currency activities and larger transactions through the use of foreign currency options or forward contracts. Principal currencies hedged have historically included the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, and Mexican peso.

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts — We enter into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates on certain intercompany and third-party trade receivables and payables. In managing our foreign currency exposures, we identify and aggregate existing offsetting positions and then hedge residual exposures through third-party derivative contracts. The gain or loss on these contracts is recorded as foreign currency gains (losses) within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income (loss). The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are recorded in prepayments and other current assets or accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Company's foreign currency forward contracts was a net asset position of less than $1 million at December 31, 2019 and a net liability position of less than $1 million at December 31, 2018.

The following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of December 31, 2019 (all of which mature in 2020):

------------------ --------- ---------------------------------- -

 Notional Amountin Foreign Currency
 (millions)
British pounds —Purchase 4
 —Sell (1 )
Canadian dollars —Sell (2 )
European euro —Sell (21 )
Japanese yen —Sell (251 )
Polish zloty —Purchase 71
Singapore dollars —Sell (17 )
South African rand —Sell (49 )
Mexican pesos —Purchase 14
U.S. dollars —Purchase 20

A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the U.S. relative to all other currencies would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to changes in the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to translation of the results of certain international operations into U.S. dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.

The following table summarizes the amounts of foreign currency translation and transaction losses:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- --- ---- - ---- -

 Years Ended December 31
 2019 2018
 (millions)
Translation gains (losses) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 16 $ (134 )
Transaction gains (losses) recorded in earnings $ (11 ) $ 15

Table of Contents

Senior Secured Notes — We have foreign currency denominated debt, €758 million of which was designated as a net investment hedge in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of ours. As such, an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates will have no effect on earnings. For the portion not designated as a net investment hedge, we have other natural hedges in place that will offset any adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates.

A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates between the euro and U.S. dollar would increase the amount of cash required to settle these notes by approximately $142 million as of December 31, 2019.

Commodity Price Risk
Commodity rate price forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices for raw materials including copper, nickel, tin, zinc, and aluminum. The fair value of our commodity price forward contracts was a net asset position of less than $1 million on an equivalent notional amount of $19 million as of December 31, 2019. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in commodity prices would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to changes in the fair values of commodity forward contracts.

Interest Rate Risk
Our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are primarily our debt securities. We use our revolving credit facilities to finance our short-term and long-term capital requirements. We pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings. Our long-term capital requirements have been financed with long-term debt with original maturity dates ranging from four to ten years. On December 31, 2019, we had $1.6 billion par value of fixed rate debt and $3.6 billion par value of floating rate debt. Of the fixed rate debt, $479 million is fixed through 2022, $636 million is fixed through 2024, and $494 million is fixed through 2026. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capitalization” earlier in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2019 was about 99% of its book value. A hypothetical one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by about $40 million.

Equity Price Risk
We also utilize an equity swap arrangement to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of our arrangements for deferred compensation and restricted stock unit awards. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these equity swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities. We selectively use cash-settled equity swaps to reduce market risk associated with our deferred compensation liabilities. These equity compensation liabilities increase as our stock price increases and decrease as our stock price decreases. In contrast, the value of the swap agreement moves in the opposite direction of these liabilities, allowing us to fix a portion of the liabilities at a certain amount. As of December 31, 2019, the Company hedged its deferred compensation liability related to approximately 600,000 common share equivalents, an increase from 250,000 common share equivalents as of December 31, 2018. The fair value of the Company's equity swap agreement was a net asset position of $1 million at December 31, 2019. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in share prices would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to the equity swaps as an offsetting change would be applied to the related deferred compensation liability.

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. These segments provide our senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our 70 ADOBE INC.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration.

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure.

Operations of the Company's homebuilding segments primarily include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Company's unconsolidated entities. Operating earnings (loss) for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and other income (expense), net, less the cost of homes sold and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the segment and loss due to litigation. The Company's reportable homebuilding segments and all other homebuilding operations not required to be reported separately, have homebuilding divisions located in: East: Florida, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina Central: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Tennessee and Virginia Texas: Texas West: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington Other: Urban divisions and other homebuilding related investments primarily in California, including Five Point Holdings, LLC ("FivePoint") Operations of the Financial Services segment include primarily mortgage financing, title and closing services primarily for buyers of the Company's homes.

Note 11.Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years.

We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchan...

Note 11.Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Legal Matters Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking 94 unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages.

ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On

OVERVIEW
Our Company
We are one of the world’s leading manufacturers of clean air, powertrain and ride performance products and systems for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway, industrial, and aftermarket customers. Both original equipment (“OE”) vehicle designers and manufacturers, and the repair and replacement markets, or aftermarket, are served globally through leading brands, including Monroe®, Champion®, Öhlins®, MOOG®, Walker®, Fel-Pro®, Wagner®, Ferodo®, Rancho®, Thrush®, National®, and Sealed Power®, among others. As of December 31, 2019, we operated 201 manufacturing facilities worldwide and employed approximately 78,000 people to service our customers’ demands.

Factors that continue to be critical to our success include winning new business awards, managing our overall global manufacturing footprint to ensure proper placement and workforce levels in line with business needs, maintaining competitive wages and benefits, maximizing efficiencies in manufacturing processes, and reducing overall costs. In addition, our ability to adapt to key industry trends, such as a shift in consumer preferences to other vehicles in response to higher fuel costs and other economic and social factors, increasing technologically sophisticated content, changing aftermarket distribution channels, increasing environmental standards and extended product life of automotive parts, also play a critical role in our success. Other factors that are critical to our success include adjusting to economic challenges such as increases in the cost of raw materials and our ability to successfully reduce the effect of any such cost increases through material substitutions, cost reduction initiatives, and other methods.

Öhlins Intressenter AB Acquisition
On January 10, 2019, we completed the acquisition of a 90.5% ownership interest in Öhlins Intressenter AB (the “Öhlins Acquisition”), a Swedish technology company that develops premium suspension systems and components for the automotive and motorsport industries. The purchase price was $162 million. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

Federal-Mogul Acquisition
On October 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in Federal-Mogul LLC (the “Federal-Mogul Acquisition”, and together with the Öhlins Acquisition, the “Acquisitions”). Total consideration was approximately $3.7 billion. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

Separation Transaction and Change in Reportable Segments
Following the closing of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition, we agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to pursue the separation of the combined company. As such, we previously announced our intention to separate our businesses through a spin-off transaction to form two new, independent, publicly traded companies, a new Powertrain Technology company (“New Tenneco”) and an Aftermarket and Ride Performance company (“DRiV”). Current end-market conditions are affecting our ability to complete a separation within our previously announced timeline and we expect these trends will continue throughout this year. During 2020, we will be focused on the execution of our accelerated performance improvement plan (“Accelerate”) to facilitate the expected separation of New Tenneco and DRiV. The Accelerate program is focused on achieving additional cost savings, improving capital efficiency, and reducing leverage. We have made significant progress to facilitate the planned separation of the DRiV business and have completed all necessary system and process components required for New Tenneco and DRiV to operate independently. In this respect, we are ready to separate the businesses as soon as favorable conditions are present. In order to facilitate the separation, we continue to evaluate multiple strategic alternatives, as well as options to deleverage and mitigate the ongoing effect of challenging market conditions.

The future New Tenneco consists of two existing operating segments, Clean Air and Powertrain:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Clean Air segment designs, manufactures, and distributes a variety of products and systems designed to reduce pollution and optimize engine performance, acoustic tuning, and weight on a vehicle for OEMs; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Powertrain segment focuses on original equipment powertrain products for automotive, heavy duty, and industrial applications.

In preparation for the separation, in the first quarter of 2019, we began to manage and report our DRiV businesses through of the previously reported Ride Performance operating segment as well as the OE Braking business that was included in the previously reported Motorparts operating segment:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 servicers market with products, including vehicle braking systems and a wide variety of chassis, engine, sealing, wiper, filter, lighting, and other general maintenance applications; and

Revenues
Revenues increased by $2,489 million, or 27%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The Federal-Mogul Acquisition increased revenues by $1,886 million, or 20%. The remaining increase in revenues was primarily driven by the net favorable effects of organic growth from higher sales volume and mix of $597 million and the favorable effects of foreign currency exchange of $12 million, this was partially offset by a net unfavorable other of $6 million.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
SG&A increased by $120 million to $752 million compared to $632 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. Included in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $96 million of acquisition and expected separation costs, $25 million of cost to achieve synergies, $18 million of cost reduction initiatives, and $10 million related to a litigation settlement, while the year ended December 31, 2017 included a $132 million antitrust settlement accrual and $22 million in cost reduction initiatives.

Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense was $345 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $226 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Engineering, research, and development
Engineering, research, and development expense was $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $158 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to the Federal-Mogul Acquisition.

Restructuring charges and asset impairments
Restructuring charges and asset impairments were $117 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $47 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Costs incurred in each period primarily relate to facility closures. See Note 4, Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments, in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

Goodwill impairment charges
As a result of our goodwill impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined the fair value of one of our reporting units in the Ride Performance segment was lower than its carrying value. Accordingly, we recorded a full goodwill impairment charge of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. This compared to an $11 million goodwill impairment related to our Ride Performance segment in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs (credits)
Non-service pension and postretirement benefit costs was up $4 million to $20 million compared to $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Loss on extinguishment of debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt was $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the repayment of our revolver and term loan A and the new refinancing in connection with the Federal-Mogul Acquisition. This compared to a $1 million charge recognized for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Interest expense
Interest expense was $148 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $77 million (substantially all in our U.S. operations) net of interest capitalized of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $71 million increase was primarily due to higher interest expense pertaining to the five-year $1.7 billion term loan A facility and the seven-year $1.7 billion term loan B facility that were entered into in

NOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Commitments We lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $170.5 million, $137.2 million and $115.4 million in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.

['s foreign currency forward contracts was a net asset position of less than $1 million at December 31, 2019 and a net liability position of less than $1 million at December 31, 2018.

The following table summarizes by major currency the notional amounts for foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts as of December 31, 2019 (all of which mature in 2020):

A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the U.S. relative to all other currencies would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to changes in the fair values of foreign currency forward contracts.

We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to translation of the results of certain international operations into U.S. dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition.

Senior Secured Notes — We have foreign currency denominated debt, €758 million of which was designated as a net investment hedge in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of ours. As such, an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates will have no effect on earnings. For the portion not designated as a net investment hedge, we have other natural hedges in place that will offset any adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates.

A hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates between the euro and U.S. dollar would increase the amount of cash required to settle these notes by approximately $142 million as of December 31, 2019.

Commodity Price Risk
Commodity rate price forward contracts are executed to offset a portion of our exposure to the potential change in prices for raw materials including copper, nickel, tin, zinc, and aluminum. The fair value of our commodity price forward contracts was a net asset position of less than $1 million on an equivalent notional amount of $19 million as of December 31, 2019. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in commodity prices would not materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows with regard to changes in the fair values of commodity forward contracts.

Interest Rate Risk
Our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates are primarily our debt securities. We use our revolving credit facilities to finance our short-term and long-term capital requirements. We pay a current market rate of interest on these borrowings. Our long-term capital requirements have been financed with long-term debt with original maturity dates ranging from four to ten years. On December 31, 2019, we had $1.6 billion par value of fixed rate debt and $3.6 billion par value of floating rate debt. Of the fixed rate debt, $479 million is fixed through 2022, $636 million is fixed through 2024, and $494 million is fixed through 2026. For more detailed explanations on our debt structure and senior credit facility refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Capitalization” earlier in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2019 was about 99% of its book value. A hypothetical one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize in the income statement and the cash we pay for interest expense by about $40 million.

Equity Price Risk
We also utilize an equity swap arrangement to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of our arrangements for deferred compensation and restricted stock unit awards. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these equity swaps are generally offset by the losses or gains on the related liabilities. We selectively use cash-settled equity swaps to reduce market risk associated with our deferred compensation liabilities. These equity compensation liabilities increase as our stock price increases and decrease as our stock price decreases. In contrast, the value of the swap agreement moves in the opposite direction of these liabilities, allowing us to fix a portion of the liabilities at a certain amount. As of December 31, 2019, the Company hedged its deferred compensation liability related to approximately 600,000 common share equivalents, an increase from 250,000 common share equivalents as of December 31, 2018.
