Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Teledyne Technologies Incorporated provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets that require advanced technology and high reliability. These markets include aerospace and defense, factory automation, air and water quality environmental monitoring, oceanographic research, deepwater oil and gas exploration and production, medical imaging and pharmaceutical research. Our products include digital imaging sensors, cameras and systems within the visible, infrared and X-ray spectra, monitoring instrumentation for marine and environmental applications, harsh environment interconnects, electronic test and measurement equipment, aircraft information management systems, and defense electronics and satellite communication subsystems. We also supply engineered systems for defense, space, environmental and energy applications. We differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer- and company-sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise.

Strategy/Overview
Our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation, digital imaging, aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems. Our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized. We intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development. We continue to focus on balanced and disciplined capital deployment among capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and share repurchases. We aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings by emphasizing cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of our business. At Teledyne, operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire. Using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development, we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets. We continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy.
Consistent with this strategy, we made three acquisitions in 2019 and in March 2017, we made our largest acquisition to date, e2v technologies plc (“e2v”). See the Recent Acquisitions section following this section.
In the third quarter of 2019, we realigned the segment reporting structure for certain business units, primarily related to certain refinements of our management reporting structure. This change primarily related to moving certain electronic manufacturing services products from the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment to the Engineered Systems segment. Total net sales for these products were $76.2 million for fiscal year 2018. Other immaterial changes included moving certain United Kingdom (“U.K.”) microwave product lines (previously within the Digital Imaging segment) and certain U.K. manufactured composite parts (previously within the Engineered Systems segment) into the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. Total net sales for these U.K. product lines was less than $20.0 million for fiscal year 2018. The realignment had no impact on the Instrumentation segment or the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the realignment. Previously reported segment data has been adjusted to reflect these changes.
As part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance, we may take and have taken actions to consolidate and relocate certain facilities and reduce headcount across various businesses, reducing our exposure to weak end markets and high cost locations. We continue to seek cost reductions in our businesses. At December 29, 2019, $1.5 million remains to be paid related to these actions.
The following pre-tax charges were incurred related to severance and facility consolidations (in millions):

Income Taxes
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was enacted, which significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing the territorial tax system and imposing a tax on deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings. The repatriation tax resulted in a net tax expense of $26.2 million and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a net tax benefit of $21.5 million, for a net provisional charge of $4.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company finalized its assessment of the Tax Act during the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting in a decrease of $0.8 million to the provisional charge and the repatriation tax.
The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was 15.3%, compared with 20.8% for 2017. For 2018 net discrete income tax benefits were $23.8 million, which included a $12.9 million income tax benefit related to share-based accounting, $5.1 million in income tax benefit as a result of the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions due to expiration of statute of limitations and a $4.8 million income tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance for which the deferred tax assets are now determined to be more-likely-than-not realizable. For 2017, net discrete income tax benefits were $17.2 million, which included an $8.5 million income tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowance for which the deferred tax assets are now determined more-likely-than-not to be realizable, $8.5 million income tax benefit as a result of the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions due to expiration of statute of limitation, and $8.8 million in net discrete tax benefits related to share-based accounting, partially offset by $4.6 million related to adjustments for uncertain tax positions and the $4.7 million provisional charge, related to the Tax Act.
Excluding the net discrete income tax benefits in both years, the effective tax rates would have been 21.3% for 2018 and 26.8% for 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2018, primarily reflects the lower corporate income tax rates as part of the Tax Act.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Principal Cash and Capital Requirements
Our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments and debt service requirements, as well as acquisitions. We may deploy cash for stock repurchases. It is anticipated that operating cash flow, together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below, will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2020. To support acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital. Our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of off-balance sheet financial arrangements. We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities.

On March 15, 2019, Teledyne amended its $750.0 million credit agreement to extend the maturity date from December 2020 to March 2024. While the borrowing capacity remains at $750.0 million, the amendment permits Teledyne to increase the aggregate amount of the borrowing capacity by up to $250.0 million subject to certain conditions. Excluding interest and fees, no payments are due under the $750.0 million unsecured credit facility (“credit facility”) until it matures. Borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are, at our option, tied to a Eurocurrency rate equal to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements. Eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in U.S. dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement. Eurocurrency or LIBOR based loans under the facility typically have terms of one, two, three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date. The Company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility. Base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate. Interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. The credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 0.12% and 0.25% of the credit line, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio.
In October 2019, Teledyne and its subsidiary, Teledyne Netherlands B.V., as borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement”) that amends and restates the Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of March 17, 2017. Pursuant to the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement, the lenders thereunder made unsecured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million, denominated in US dollars, $100.0 million of which was used to repay outstanding loans, which had a maturity date of October 30, 2019. Also, on October 30, 2019,

Teledyne entered into a cross currency swap to effectively convert the $150.0 million term loan to a €135.2 million denominated instrument with a fixed euro interest rate of 0.612%.
Our credit facility, senior notes and term loans agreements require the Company to comply with various financial and operating covenants, including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt. At December 29, 2019, the Company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios. Currently, we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing, if needed, is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below.
Financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at December 29, 2019:

(c) Purchase obligations generally include contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services and capital commitments that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.

Unrecognized tax benefits of $24.5 million are not included in the table above because $10.6 million is offset by deferred tax assets, and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history and offsetting credits.
At December 29, 2019, we were not required, and accordingly are not planning, to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2020. Our minimum funding requirements after 2020 as set forth by ERISA, are dependent on several factors as discussed under “Accounting for Pension Plans” in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Estimates beyond 2020 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change until the Company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times. In addition, certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery

through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government under certain government contracts, therefore, future cash contributions are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity. We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future.
Operating Activities
In 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $482.1 million, compared with $446.9 million in 2018 and $374.7 million in 2017. The higher cash provided by operating activities in 2019, compared with 2018, was driven by higher operating income, cash flow from recent acquisitions, partially offset by $45.4 million of higher income tax payments. The higher cash provided by operating activities in 2018, compared with 2017, was driven by higher operating income, partially offset by $28.0 million of higher income tax payments.
Free cash flow (cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $393.7 million in 2019, compared with $360.1 million in 2018 and $316.2 million in 2017.

Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment (88.4) (86.8) (58.5)

Free cash flow $ 393.7 $ 360.1 $ 316.2

a) We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities (a measure prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles) less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment. The company believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to assist management and the investment community in analyzing the company’s ability to generate cash flow.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $571.9 million, $88.6 million and $831.2 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash flows relating to investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and other investments and capital expenditures.

Financing Activities
Financing activities for 2019 reflected net proceeds from debt of $108.8 million, compared with net payments on debt of $306.5 million in 2018 and net proceeds from debt of $393.7 million for 2017. Fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 reflect proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $34.6 million, $37.2 million and $24.9 million, respectively.
Other Matters
Pension Plans
Teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees hired before January 1, 2004, or approximately 10% of Teledyne’s active employees as of December 29, 2019. As of January 1, 2004, new U.S. hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, Teledyne’s domestic pension plan was over 100% funded, thus no cash contributions were made. For the Company’s qualified defined benefit pension plans, the discount rate for 2020 will decrease to an average of 3.41% from 4.59% in 2019. The company also has several small non-qualified domestic and foreign-based defined benefit pension plans.
Income Taxes
Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.
We intend to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the United States. The cash that the Company’s foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including foreign acquisitions. We estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements. Due to the Tax Act, U.S. federal and applicable state income taxes have been accrued for the deemed repatriation. At December 29, 2019, the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was $309.5 million, for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $1.4 million for corporate income taxes which would be due if reinvested foreign earnings were repatriated. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that we would no longer indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the United States.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income. Based on the Company’s history of operating earnings, expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies, management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance.

Table of Contents
We file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded on all U.S. federal income tax matters for all years through 2015, United Kingdom income tax matters for all years through 2017, France income tax matters for all years through 2016 and Canadian income tax matters for all years through 2011.
Costs and Pricing
Inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate. Current inventory costs, the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies. The Company emphasizes cost containment and cost reductions in all aspects of its business.
Hedging Activities and Market Risk Disclosures
Teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting the Company to foreign currency risk. The Company’s primary objective is to protect the United States dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings. The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in Canadian dollars for our Canadian companies, and in British pounds for our U.K. companies. These contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. The Company has converted U.S. dollar denominated, variable rate and fixed rate debt obligations of a European subsidiary, into euro fixed rate obligations using a receive float, pay fixed cross currency swap, and a received fixed pay, fixed cross currency swap. These cross currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. In addition, the Company has converted domestic U.S. variable rate debt to fixed rate debt using a receive variable, pay fixed interest rate swap. The interest rate swap is also designated as a cash flow hedge.
 The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge forward contracts, the cross currency swap hedges, and the interest rate swap cash flow hedge is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis, as well as using other timing and probability criteria. To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. The effective portion of the cash flow hedge forward contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income, at which time the effective amount in AOCI is reclassified to revenue in our consolidated statements of income. For the cross currency swap and interest rate cash flow hedges, effective amounts are recorded in AOCI, and reclassified into interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. In addition, for the cross currency swaps an amount is reclassified from AOCI to other income and expense each reporting period, to offset the earnings impact of the remeasurement of the hedged liabilities. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI, net of tax, for forward contracts that will mature in the next 12 months total $0.8 million. These gains are expected to be offset by anticipated losses in the value of the forecasted underlying hedged item. Amounts related to the cross currency swaps and interest rate swap expected to be reclassified from AOCI into income in the coming 12 months total $5.9 million.
In the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes remote that they will occur, within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from AOCI to other income and expense. During the current reporting period, all forecasted transactions occurred and, therefore, there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense, due to missed forecasts.
As of December 29, 2019, Teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy Canadian dollars and to sell U.S. dollars totaling $75.7 million. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from March 2020 to February 2021. Teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy British pounds and to sell U.S. dollars totaling $17.1 million. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from March 2020 to February 2021. Together these contracts had a negative fair value of $1.1 million.
The cross currency swaps have notional amounts of €113.0 million and $125.0 million, and €135.0 million and $150.0 million, and mature in March 2023 and October 2024, respectively. The interest rate swap has a notional amount of $125.0 million and matures in March 2023.

In addition, the Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany receivables and payables. As of December 29, 2019, Teledyne primarily had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs (in millions):

-------------------- ------ ---- ----------------- ------ ------------ --- ----

Contracts to Buy Contracts to Sell
Currency Amount Currency Amount
Canadian Dollars $ 7.9 U.S. Dollars US$ 6.2
Euros € 35.8 U.S. Dollars US$ 39.2

Great Britain Pounds £ 44.9 U.S. Dollars US$ 55.5
Canadian Dollars $ 11.9 Euros € 8.2

Danish Krone Kr. 66.2 U.S. Dollars US$ 9.7
Great Britain Pounds £ 9.1 Euros € 10.3

These contracts had a negative fair value of $0.3 million at December 29, 2019. The gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments, are intended to, at a minimum, partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings.
All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes.
Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. A hypothetical 10 percent price change of the U.S. dollar from its value at December 29, 2019, would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy Canadian dollars and to sell U.S. dollars by approximately $7.6 million. A hypothetical 10 percent price change in the U.S. dollar from its value at December 29, 2019 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy British Pounds and to sell U.S. dollars by approximately $1.7 million. A hypothetical 10 percent price change in the U.S. dollar from its value at December 29, 2019 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our Euro/U.S. Dollar cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges by approximately $28.7 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in U.S. interest rates at December 29, 2019 would result in an increase in the fair value of our U.S. Dollar interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge by approximately $3.7 million, while a 100 basis point decrease would result in a decrease in its fair value of $3.5 million.
Borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility. Loans under the facility typically have terms of one, two, three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date. Interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio. As of December 29, 2019, we had $125.0 million outstanding under our $750.0 million credit facility. Any borrowings under the Company’s credit facility are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and, consequently, the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates.
Our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks. We own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable.
Environmental
We are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations. These include sites at which Teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws. We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites. Reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled $6.0 million at both December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018. As investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received, the Company will adjust accruals to reflect new information. Based on current information, we do not believe that future environmental costs, in excess of those already accrued, will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity. See also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 24 and Notes 2 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Government Contracts
We perform work on a number of contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other agencies and departments of the U.S. Government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors. Sales under these contracts with the U.S. Government, which included contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, were approximately 24% of total net sales in 2019, 23% of total net sales in 2018 and 24% of total sales in 2017. For a summary of sales to the U.S. Government by segment, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense represented approximately 17%, 17% and 18% of total net sales for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations, which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. See also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 18.
For information on accounts receivable from the U.S. Government, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Estimates and Reserves
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to product returns and replacements, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, pension and other postretirement benefits, long-term contracts, environmental, workers’ compensation and general liability, employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time, the results of which form the basis for making our judgments. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In some cases, such differences may be material. See also Critical Accounting Policies.
The following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts, which are estimates and based on judgments as described above, at December 29, 2019, and December 30, 2018:

-------------------------------------------------------- ---- ---- ---- - ----
Reserves and Valuation Accounts (in millions): (a) 2019 2018
Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 10.2 $ 6.8
Reduction to LIFO cost basis $ 7.8 $ 9.4
Workers’ compensation and general liability reserves (b) $ 6.5 $ 8.9

Environmental reserves (b) $ 6.0 $ 6.0
Other accrued liability reserves (b) $ 16.0 $ 26.5

(a) This table should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
(b) Includes both long-term and short-term reserves.
Some of the Company’s products are subject to standard warranties and the Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties. We regularly assess the adequacy of our pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products, as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties, which are typically one year. The product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet.

------------------------------- ------ ---- ---- ------ ---- ---- ----- - ----
Warranty Reserve (in millions): 2019 2018 2017
Balance at beginning of year $ 21.0 $ 21.1 $ 18.4
Product warranty expense 13.1 10.0 6.0
Deductions (14.2) (10.1) (6.4)
Acquisitions 4.9 — 3.1
Balance at year-end $ 24.8 $ 21.0 $ 21.1

Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment, complexity and uncertainty, and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following as critical accounting policies: revenue recognition; accounting for pension plans; accounting for business combinations, goodwill and acquired intangible assets; and accounting for income taxes. For additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revenue Recognition
Approximately 40% of our revenue is recognized over time with the remaining 60% of our revenue recognized at a point in time.
Revenue recognized over time relates primarily to contracts to design, develop and/or manufacture highly engineered products used in both defense and commercial applications. The transaction price in these arrangements may include estimated amounts of variable consideration, including award fees, incentive fees, contract amounts not yet funded, or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. We estimate variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled, and we include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the estimation uncertainty is resolved. The estimation of this variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. As control transfers continuously over time on these contracts, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress as this measure best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation.
For over time contracts using cost-to-cost, we have an Estimate at Completion (“EAC”) process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations. This EAC process requires management judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue, determining reasonably dependable cost estimates, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Since certain contracts extend over a longer period of time, the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings through a cumulative catch-up basis. This method recognizes, in the current period, the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters. Additionally, if the current contract estimate indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident. Contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly.
 We do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for 2019, 2018 or 2017 was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods.
Revenue recognized at a point in time relates primarily to the sale of standard or minimally customized products, with control transferring to the customer generally upon the transfer of title. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional revenue recognition disclosures.
Pension Plans
The Company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan. In consultation with our actuaries, we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits. Net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor. The accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over our average employee future service period of approximately nine years. Significant assumptions used in determining the Company’s pension income or expense is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant mortality estimates, expected rates of increase in future compensation levels, employee turnover, as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations.

Table of Contents
Differences in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on 2019 pension expense (in millions):

------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------ ----- ------------------------------ - ---
 0.25 Percentage Point Increase 0.25 Percentage Point Decrease
Increase (decrease) to pension expense resulting from:
Change in discount rate $ (1.2) $ 1.3
Change in long-term rate of return on plan assets $ (2.1) $ 2.1

See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional pension disclosures.
Business Combinations, Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
The results for all acquisitions are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition. Business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill. We determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities, often in consultation with third-party valuation advisors. Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period.
Goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. We review goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. The Company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. We test goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors.
We may use either a qualitative or quantitative approach when testing a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform a quantitative test for each reporting unit at least once every three years.
For goodwill impairment testing using the quantitative approach, the Company estimates the fair value of the selected reporting units primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans, and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values over a multi-year period. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.
Changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the Company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit subject to a quantitative impairment test and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this sensitivity analysis, the Company did not identify any goodwill impairment. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.
As of December 29, 2019, the Company had nine reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. The carrying value of goodwill included in the Company’s individual reporting units ranged from $1.2 million to $870.2 million. The Company’s analysis in 2019 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit) for the Company’s reporting units subject to a quantitative test as of the fourth quarter of 2019, the annual testing date, exceeded at least 77%.

Income Taxes
Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards. Although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.
Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.
An increase of 100 basis points in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, of $4.7 million. For a description of the Company’s tax accounting policies, refer to Note 2 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Recent Accounting Standards

Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation contains forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, directly and indirectly relating to earnings, growth opportunities, acquisitions and divestitures, product sales, capital expenditures, pension matters, stock option compensation expense, the credit facility, interest expense, severance and relocation costs, environmental remediation cost, stock repurchases, taxes, exchange rate fluctuations and strategic plans. All statements made in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forward-looking. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
Many factors could change the anticipated results, including: disruptions in the global economy; changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics, instrumentation, digital imaging, energy exploration and production, commercial aviation, semiconductor and communications markets; funding, continuation and award of government programs; cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures; impacts from the United Kingdom’s pending exit from the European Union; uncertainties related to the policies of the U.S. Presidential administration; the imposition and expansion of, and responses to, trade sanctions and tariffs; and threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information, including cyber security threats. Lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as instability in the Middle East or other oil producing regions, and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production, including with respect to hydraulic fracturing could further negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry. Disruptions from the production delay of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft and increasing fuel costs will negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses. If the Coronavirus outbreak continues and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions, we could experience lower demand for our products and global supply disruptions. In addition, financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets.
Changes in the policies of U.S. and foreign governments, including economic sanctions, could result, over time, in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the Company participates.
While Teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions, we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as, among others, our ability to integrate acquired businesses, retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies. There are additional risks associated with acquiring, owning and operating businesses outside of the United States, including those arising from U.S. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.
