ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

31

Table of Contents
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6, "Selected Financial Data" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors."
Overview
We develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers and diode lasers that are used for diverse applications, primarily in materials processing. We also manufacture and sell complementary products used with our lasers including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical processing heads, in-line sensors and chillers. In addition, we offer laser-based and non-laser based systems for certain markets and applications. Our portfolio of laser solutions are used in materials processing, communications, medical and advanced applications. We sell our products globally to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), system integrators and end users. We market our products internationally, primarily through our direct sales force. Our major manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Germany and Russia. We have sales service offices and applications laboratories worldwide.
We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture most of the key components used in our finished products, from semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers, amplifiers and complementary products. Our vertically integrated operations allow us to reduce manufacturing costs, control quality, rapidly develop and integrate advanced products and protect our proprietary technology.
Description of Our Net Sales, Costs and Expenses
Net sales. We derive net sales primarily from the sale of fiber lasers, diode lasers, laser and non-laser based systems, amplifiers and complementary products. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials processing laser systems, communications systems, medical laser systems and other laser systems to end users. We also sell our laser products and laser and non-laser based systems to end users. Our scientists and engineers work closely with OEMs, systems integrators and end users to analyze their system requirements and match appropriate fiber laser, amplifier or system specifications to those requirements. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several months.
Sales of our products are generally recognized upon shipment, provided that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Sales of customized robotic systems are recognized over time. Our sales typically are made on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase commitments.
We develop our products to standard specifications and use a common set of components within our product architectures. Our major products are based upon a common technology platform. We continually enhance these and other products by improving their components and developing new components and new product designs.
Cost of sales. Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead. We are vertically integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for our products as well as assemble finished products. We believe our vertical integration allows us to increase efficiencies, leverage our scale and lower our cost of sales. Cost of sales also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing, engineering and service operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, shipping costs and reserves for inventory obsolescence and for warranty obligations. Inventories are written off and charged to cost of sales when identified as excess or obsolete.
Due to our vertical integration strategy and ongoing investment in plant and machinery, we maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead. We may not be able to or choose not to adjust these fixed costs to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Our gross margin is therefore significantly affected by our sales volume and the corresponding utilization of capacity and absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses.
Sales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of costs related to compensation, trade shows, professional and technical conferences, travel, facilities, depreciation of equipment used for demonstration purposes and other marketing costs.
Research and development. Our research and development expense consists primarily of compensation, development expenses related to the design of our products and certain components, the cost of materials and components to build prototype devices for testing and facilities costs. Costs related to product development are recorded as research and development expenses in the period in which they are incurred.

General and administrative. Our general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and other administrative personnel, outside legal and professional fees, insurance premiums and fees, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses such as charges and benefits related to the change in allowance for doubtful debt.
Factors and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results
In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance.
Net sales. Our net sales grew from $1,006.2 million in 2016 to $1,314.6 million in 2019, representing a three year compound annual growth rate of approximately 9%. Net sales growth was driven by increasing demand for our products, partially offset by declines in average sales prices, the introduction of new products, including laser and non-laser systems, high power and ultra-fast pulsed lasers, optical heads and other accessories and the development of new applications for our products some of which displace non-laser technologies. Our annual revenue growth rates have varied. Net sales decreased by 10% in 2019 and increased by 4% and 40%, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by end users, particularly by manufacturers using our products for materials processing, which includes general manufacturing, automotive, other transportation, aerospace, heavy industry, consumer, semiconductor and electronics. Approximately 94% of our revenues in 2019 were from customers using our products for materials processing. Although applications within materials processing are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by end users of materials processing equipment and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending.
Our net sales have historically fluctuated from quarter to quarter. The increase or decrease in sales from a prior quarter can be affected by the timing of orders received from customers, the shipment, installation and acceptance of products at our customers' facilities, the mix of OEM orders and one-time orders for products with large purchase prices, competitive pressures, acquisitions, economic and political conditions in a certain country or region and seasonal factors such as the purchasing patterns and levels of activity throughout the year in the regions where we operate. Net sales can be affected by the time taken to qualify our products for use in new applications in the end markets that we serve. The adoption of our products by a new customer or qualification in a new application can lead to an increase in net sales for a period, which may then slow until we penetrate new markets or obtain new customers.
In the recent years, our net sales have been susceptible to negative impacts of tariffs. New tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments, including the Chinese government (which has imposed retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. goods including certain optical and electronic products and components). We have seen a drop in demand for our products, particularly in the materials processing market as result.
We are also susceptible to global or regional disruptions such as political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, natural disasters, macroeconomic concerns and particularly the impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak that affect the level of capital expenditures or global commerce. The novel coronavirus outbreak is understood to have started in China, which is a large and important market for IPG, with repercussions for other markets. With respect to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak specifically, we currently expect that our first quarter 2020 financial results will be negatively impacted, potentially to a material degree. In addition, as of the time of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we expect that the 2019 novel coronavirus could continue to negatively impact our businesses beyond the first quarter of 2020, but the extent and duration of such impacts over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the coronavirus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, including mobility restrictions and work restrictions, and the impact of these and other factors on our customer base and general commercial activity.
The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as increased competition, decreased manufacturing costs and increases in unit volumes. We may also reduce selling prices in order to penetrate new markets and applications. Furthermore, we may negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that place high unit volume orders.
The secular shift to fiber laser technology in large materials processing applications, such as cutting applications, had a positive effect on our sales trends in the past such that our sales trends were often better than other capital equipment manufacturers in both positive and negative economic cycles. As the secular shift to fiber laser technology matures in such applications, our sales trends are more susceptible to economic cycles which affect other capital equipment manufacturers.

Gross margin. Our total gross margin in any period can be significantly affected by total net sales in any period, by competitive factors, by product mix, and by other factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar, some of which are not under our control. For instance,
•As our products mature, we can experience additional competition which tends to decrease average selling prices and affects gross margin;
•Our gross margin can be significantly affected by product mix. Within each of our product categories, the gross margin is generally higher for devices with greater average power. These higher power products often have better performance, more difficult specifications to attain and fewer competing products in the marketplace;
•Higher power lasers also use a greater number of optical components, improving absorption of fixed overhead costs and enabling economies of scale in manufacturing;
•The gross margin for certain specialty products may be higher because there are fewer or sometimes no equivalent competing products;
•Customers that purchase devices in greater unit volumes generally receive lower prices per device than customers that purchase fewer units. These lower selling prices to high unit volume customers may be partially offset by the improved absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with larger product volumes, which drive economies of scale in manufacturing; and finally,
•Gross margin on systems and communication components can be lower than margins for our laser and amplifier sources, depending on the configuration, volume and competitive forces, among other factors.
We expect that some new technologies, products and systems will have returns above our cost of capital but may have gross margins below our corporate average. If we are able to develop opportunities that are significant in size, competitively advantageous or leverage our existing technology base and leadership, our current gross margin levels may not be maintained. Instead, we aim to deliver industry-leading levels of gross and operating margins by growing our market position across the broader markets we serve.
We invested $133.5 million, $160.3 million and $126.5 million in capital expenditures in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Most of this investment relates to expansion of our manufacturing capacity and, to a lesser extent, research and development and sales-related facilities.
A high proportion of our costs is fixed so costs are generally difficult to adjust or may take time to adjust in response to changes in demand. In addition, our fixed costs increase as we expand our capacity. If we expand capacity faster than is required by sales growth, gross margins could be negatively affected. Gross margins generally decline if production volumes are lower as a result of a decrease in sales or a reduction in inventory because the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs will be reduced. Gross margins generally improve when the opposite occurs. If both sales and inventory decrease in the same period, the decline in gross margin may be greater if we cannot reduce fixed costs or choose not to reduce fixed costs to match the decrease in the level of production. If we experience a decline in sales that reduces absorption of our fixed costs, or if we have production issues, our gross margins will be negatively affected.
We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or are determined to be excess. Any provision for such slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded provisions for slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory totaling $38.9 million, $13.0 million and $16.9 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Selling and general and administrative expenses. In the past, the Company has invested in selling and general and administrative costs in order to support continued growth in the company. As the secular shift to fiber laser technology matures, our sales growth becomes more susceptible to the cyclical trends typical of capital equipment manufacturers. Accordingly, our future management of and investments in selling and general and administrative expenses will also be influenced by these trends, although we may still invest in selling or general and administrative functions to support certain initiatives even in economic down cycles. Certain general and administrative expenses are not related to the level of sales and may vary quarter to quarter based primarily upon the level of acquisitions and litigation.
Research and development expenses. We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products, systems and applications technology. We believe that these investments will sustain our position as a leader in the fiber laser industry and will support development of new products that can address new markets and growth opportunities. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period.

Cost reduction program. During the fourth quarter of 2019, IPG implemented a cost reduction program in response to continued global macroeconomic, competitive and geopolitical headwinds. The Company expects to reduce annualized manufacturing and operating expenses by approximately $30 million. As part of this program the Company will reduce global headcount by more than 300 positions and decrease other direct labor costs and expenses. IPG has implemented a hiring freeze and expects limited replacement of workforce attrition to result in further headcount reductions. Refer to Note 6, "Restructuring," for discussion of the 2019 charges associated with this program.
Long-lived assets impairments. We review our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, lack of growth in our relevant business units or differences in the estimated product acceptance rates could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets.
Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance at many points during the analysis. Also, the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. If our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations. Further discussion of impairment charges recorded during 2019 can be found in Note 6, "Restructuring," and Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets."
Foreign exchange. Because we are a U.S. based company doing business globally, we have both translational and transactional exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the relative exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies in which our subsidiaries operate directly affects our sales, costs and earnings. Differences in the relative exchange rates between where we sell our products and where we incur manufacturing and other operating costs (primarily in the U.S., Germany and Russia) also affects our costs and earnings. Certain currencies experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like the Euro, the Russian Ruble, the Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan have had and could have an additional significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Our ability to adjust the foreign currency selling prices of products in response to changes in exchange rates is limited and may not offset the impact of the changes in exchange rates on the translated value of sales or costs. In addition, if we increase the selling price of our products in local currencies, this could have a negative impact on the demand for our products.
Major customers. While we have historically depended on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net sales, the composition of this group can change from year to year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a percentage of our annual net sales were 21%, 26% and 28% in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our largest customer accounted for 9%, 12% and 13% of our net sales in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We seek to add new customers and to expand our relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the composition of our significant customers will continue to change. We generally do not enter into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase a fixed number or large volume of our fiber lasers or amplifiers. If any of our significant customers were to substantially reduce their purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, which may materially affect our operating results and financial position. We have identified the following items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, inventory valuation, warranty, and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue Recognition — Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer occurs in an amount reflecting the consideration that we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve this core principle, we apply the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.

Table of Contents
We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price, as more fully described in Note 1, "Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition," in our consolidated financial statements. Revenue is generally recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when our performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment but which can occur over time for certain of our systems contracts. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer, but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. With the acquisition of Genesis Systems in December 2018, we enter into contracts to sell customized robotic systems, for which revenue is generally recognized over time, depending on the terms of the contract. Recognizing revenue over time for these contracts is based on our judgment that the customized robotic system does not have an alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Recognizing revenue over time also requires estimation of the progress towards completion based on the projected costs for the contract.
Inventory — Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or market value. Inventory includes parts and components that may be specialized in nature and subject to rapid obsolescence. We maintain a reserve for excess or obsolete inventory items. The reserve is based upon a review of inventory materials on hand, which we compare with historic usage, estimated future usage and age. In addition, we review the inventory and compare recorded costs with estimates of current market value. Write-downs are recorded to reduce the carrying value to the net realizable value with respect to any part with costs in excess of current market value. Estimating demand and current market values is inherently difficult, particularly given that we make highly specialized components and products. We determine the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory by making our best estimate considering the current quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for this inventory to support future sales of our products. We often have limited information on which to base our forecasts. If future sales differ from these forecasts, the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory may change and additional inventory provisions may be required. Because of our vertical integration, a significant or sudden decrease in sales could result in a significant change in the estimates of excess or obsolete inventory valuation.
Warranty — We maintain an accrual for warranty claims for units sold that are subject to warranty. We estimate this accrual considering past claims experience, the number of units still carrying warranty coverage and the average life of the remaining warranty period. A change in the rate of warranty repairs or when warranty is generally incurred during the warranty period could change our estimated warranty accrual and associated warranty expense.
Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes — Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and tax returns in numerous international jurisdictions. We must estimate our income tax expense after considering, among other factors, if inter-company transactions have been made on an arm’s length basis, differing tax rates between jurisdictions, allocation factors, tax credits, nondeductible items and changes in enacted tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. As we continue to expand globally, there is a risk that, due to complexity within and diversity among the various jurisdictions in which we do business, a governmental agency may disagree with the manner in which we have computed our taxes. Additionally, due to the lack of uniformity among all of the foreign and domestic taxing authorities, there may be situations where the tax treatment of an item in one jurisdiction is different from the tax treatment in another jurisdiction or that the transaction causes a tax liability to arise in another jurisdiction.
We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. Reserves recorded are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is "more likely than not" to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2019, we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $11.4 million that, if recognized, would be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense.
Goodwill and Long-lived Asset Impairment — We perform our annual goodwill impairment review as of the first day of our fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include significant and sustained reductions in sales volume, margin, profitability or cash flows of the reporting unit or changes in market dynamics, including technology or product changes. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. Intangible assets and other long-lived assets are also subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates

36

Table of Contents
include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. Assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date. Additionally, these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, then one or more of our reporting units might become impaired in the future. As detailed in Note 7, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets," we recorded goodwill impairment losses totaling $37.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which related to our SND and telecommunications reporting units. Further, the estimated fair value of our Genesis reporting unit, which was acquired in December 2018, approximates the carrying value, which is expected for a recent acquisition. We will continue to monitor this reporting unit during 2020. If our estimates of future performance are reduced or if other market assumptions change such that the fair value of the reporting unit is reduced, impairment charges may be incurred. The value of goodwill associated with the Genesis reporting unit is $44.4 million at December 31, 2019.
Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. We review definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value.

Sales for materials processing applications decreased due to lower sales of high power, medium power, pulsed, and QCW lasers, partially offset by an increase in sales of laser and non-laser systems and other revenue.
•High power laser sales decreased primarily due to lower sales of lasers used for cutting, welding, and laser sintering applications. Within cutting applications, decreased sales were driven by lower average selling prices and weaker demand in China and Europe. The decrease in sales of high power lasers used in welding applications was driven by lower sales into automotive and EV battery applications. Within the laser sintering business, decreased sales were driven by weaker sales in Europe for metal based additive manufacturing.
•The decrease in medium power sales related to weakness in fine cutting applications and laser sintering for metal-based additive manufacturing. The reduced revenue in fine cutting applications was due in part to the ongoing transition to kilowatt scale high power lasers for these applications.
•The decrease in pulsed laser sales was due to lower sales of lasers used for marking and battery processing applications, partially offset by growth in green and ultrafast pulsed lasers.
•QCW laser sales decreased due to lower demand for consumer electronics and drilling applications.
•The increase in laser and non-laser systems sales was largely due to the acquisition of Genesis and partially driven by growth in macro-systems for welding applications.
•Other Revenue sales increased compared to last year due to the increased sales of parts, service, and accessories.
 Sales for other applications remained consistent in 2019 as compared to 2018. Sales to telecom applications decreased, but was offset by increased sales in government and medical applications.

(1) The substantial majority of sales in North America are to customers in the United States.
Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales increased by $48.8 million, or 7.4%, to $708.4 million in 2019 from $659.6 million in 2018. Our gross margin decreased to 46.1% in 2019 from 54.8% in 2018. Gross margin decreased mainly due to a decrease in average selling prices and higher inventory provisions. Expenses related to provisions for excess or obsolete inventory and other valuation adjustments increased by $25.9 million to $38.9 million, or 3.0% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $13.0 million, or 0.9% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Inventory provisions increased in 2019 due to review for slowing moving and excess inventory in light of lower sales during the year and the more volatile macroeconomic, geopolitical, and competitive environment in which we have recently been operating. In addition, gross margin was impacted by lower absorption of manufacturing expenses. Product mix also reduced gross margin because the systems sold by Genesis, a business that we acquired in December 2018, have a lower gross margin than the core laser business. The acquisition of Genesis reduced gross margin by 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $19.9 million, or 34.4%, to $77.7 million in 2019 from $57.8 million in 2018, primarily as a result of sales and marketing expense for new acquisitions, including Genesis, as well as increases in salaries and benefits, depreciation and other selling expenses. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 5.9% in 2019 from 4.0% in 2018.
Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $7.2 million, or 5.9%, to $130.0 million in 2019 from $122.8 million in 2018, primarily as a result of an increase in materials used for research and development, consultants, information technology, outside processing, leasing and depreciation, partially offset by reductions in personnel and contractors. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes and developing manufacturing of new components such as crystals and refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields and productivity. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as UV, visible and mid-IR, lasers with ultrafast pulses, laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding and cutting heads. In addition to new products, research and development is focused on enhancing the performance of our existing products by improving their electrical efficiency and increasing their average power. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 9.9% in 2019 from 8.4% in 2018. We expect to continue to invest in research and development and that research and development expense will increase in the aggregate.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $5.2 million, or 5.1%, to $107.6 million in 2019 from $102.4 million in 2018, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Genesis and increased expenses for information technology, depreciation and insurance, partially offset by lower banking fees, personnel and legal expenses. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 8.2% in 2019 from 7.0% in 2018.
Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating expenses. We estimate that if exchange rates had been the same as one year ago, sales in 2019 would have been $44.5 million higher, gross margin would have been $23.9 million higher and operating expenses in total would have been $5.8 million higher. These estimates assume constant exchange rates between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018 and are calculated using the average exchange rates for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018 for the respective currencies, which were US$1=Euro 0.85, US$1=Japanese Yen 110, US$1=Chinese Yuan 6.62 and US$1=Russian Ruble 63.

Goodwill impairment, impairment of long-lived assets and other restructuring charges. During 2019, we incurred non-cash goodwill impairment losses of $37.1 million, non-cash impairment losses of long-lived assets of $5.3 million and other restructuring charges of $1.8 million in total.
As a result of our 2019 annual impairment test for our transceivers reporting unit, we recognized a non-cash impairment loss of $19.3 million, which was equal to the carrying value of goodwill prior to its impairment. The analysis considered lower than forecasted sales and profitability, as well as the impact of delays in new product launches.
In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we decided to cease further development in our submarine network division ("SND") after assessing the additional investment required to enter and obtain significant market share in this industry. As of December 31, 2019, we incurred cumulative pre-tax costs of $21.2 million, which includes a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $17.8 million and non-cash impairment loss for other assets of $2.9 million. In addition, $0.2 million of severance and employee benefit costs were incurred and $0.3 million related to contract cancellations.
We also implemented other restructuring programs globally, which were primarily focused on workforce reduction and facility consolidation. These programs resulted in expenses of $3.8 million, including $1.3 million of severance and employee benefit costs and $2.5 million of non-cash impairment loss for long lived assets.
Loss (gain) on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange loss of $12.8 million in 2019 as compared to a gain of $6.2 million in 2018. The change was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Russian Ruble, the depreciation of the Chinese Yuan, and depreciation of the Brazilian Real as compared to the U.S. Dollar, which was partially offset by a gain attributed to the depreciation of the Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar.
Interest income (expense), net. Interest income (expense), net increased to $14.2 million of income in 2019 compared to $9.1 million of income in 2018. In 2018, we repatriated $522.0 million of cash from Germany to the United States, which has been invested for the entirety of 2019, resulting in higher earnings.
Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $68.1 million in 2019 compared to $130.2 million in 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 27.4% in 2019 and 24.4% in 2018. The increased effective tax rate was primarily due to higher percent of earnings outside the U.S. taxed at higher rates and changes in discrete adjustments. Discrete adjustments in 2019 include (i) a decrease to tax expense of $5.1 million related to equity based compensation deductions for tax in excess of the deductions reflected in book income and (ii) an increase to tax expense of $10.0 million for goodwill impairments losses which were not deductible for tax. Discrete adjustments in 2018 include (i) a decrease to tax expense of $13.3 million related to equity based compensation deductions for tax in excess of the deductions reflected in book income; (ii) an increase to tax expense of $6.6 million related to U.S. tax on profits earned in 2017 calculated at the prior year federal rate of 35% flowing through consolidated income in 2018; and (iii) an increase in the valuation allowance of $7.4 million primarily for state credits.
Net income attributed to IPG Photonics Corporation. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation decreased by $223.8 million to $180.2 million in 2019 from $404.0 million in 2018. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales decreased by 14.0% to 13.7% in 2019 from 27.7% in 2018 due to the factors described above.

Sales for materials processing applications increased due to higher sales of high power and pulsed lasers and laser systems, partially offset by a decrease in sales of medium and low power lasers and QCW lasers.
•High power laser sales increased primarily due to growth in sales for cutting applications offset by declines in sales in welding applications. Within cutting applications, we continue to see a migration to lasers with higher output powers which improve processing speeds and enable processing of thicker materials. The shift towards lasers with higher output powers has also benefited sales due to their higher average selling prices.
•Medium and low power sales decreased due to lower sales for cutting and laser sintering applications partially offset by higher sales for welding applications. The decline in sales for cutting applications is largely due to the use of high power lasers instead of medium power lasers for these applications as the low cost cutting systems market has gravitated to higher power lasers as their selling price per watt has decreased.
•Pulsed laser sales increased due to growth in sales of high power pulsed lasers used for cutting, marking and engraving and cleaning applications partially offset by decreases in pulsed lasers used for ablation.
•QCW laser sales decreased due to lower sales for welding applications. Welding applications for QCW lasers are largely related to consumer electronics manufacturing and the investment cycle for this application was weaker in 2018 and 2017.
•Laser systems sales increased due to increases in sales for cutting systems, as well as incremental sales from the acquisition of ILT in July 2017 and the acquisition of Genesis in December 2018.
Sales for other applications increased due to higher sales of high power lasers and high power amplifiers used for advanced applications as well as increased sales of telecommunication components, including pluggable transceivers used in data transmission.

(1) The substantial majority of sales in North America are to customers in the United States.
Cost of sales and gross margin. Cost of sales increased by $47.6 million, or 7.8%, to $659.6 million in 2018 from $612.0 million in 2017. Our gross margin decreased to 54.8% in 2018 from 56.6% in 2017. Gross margin decreased due to lower absorption of manufacturing costs, decreases in average selling prices and changes in product sales mix. The impact to gross margin primarily occurred in the second half of the year in conjunction with the slowdown in sales and increased competition for certain products in China. Expenses related to provisions for excess or obsolete inventory and other valuation adjustments decreased by $3.9 million to $13.0 million, or 0.9% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $16.9 million, or 1.2% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Sales and marketing expense. Sales and marketing expense increased by $8.0 million, or 16.1%, to $57.8 million in 2018 from $49.8 million in 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, depreciation, trade show and exhibitions, and travel expense. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense increased to 4.0% in 2018 from 3.5% in 2017.
Research and development expense. Research and development expense increased by $21.9 million, or 21.7%, to $122.8 million in 2018 from $100.9 million in 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in personnel, materials, contractors, consultants, depreciation and other research and development expense. Research and development continues to focus on developing new products, enhancing performance of existing components, improving production processes and developing manufacturing of new components such as crystals and refining production processes to improve manufacturing yields and productivity. New products include lasers that operate at different wavelengths such as UV, visible and mid-IR, lasers with ultrafast pulses, laser based systems for material processing, projection, display and medical as well as accessories such as welding and cutting heads and components such as ASICs used in pluggable transceivers in the telecom industry. In addition to new products research and development is focused on enhancing the performance of our existing products by improving their electrical efficiency and increasing their average power. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 8.4% in 2018 from 7.2% in 2017.
General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense increased by $21.7 million, or 26.9%, to $102.4 million in 2018 from $80.7 million in 2017, primarily as a result of increased expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation, professional services expenses related to acquisitions, accounting legal and information technology expenses, and depreciation expense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 7.0% in 2018 from 5.7% in 2017.
Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating expenses. We estimate that if exchange rates had been the same as one year ago, sales in 2018 would have been $35.8 million lower, gross margin would have been $23.3 million lower and operating expenses in total would have been $1.3 million higher. These estimates assume constant exchange rates between fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017 and are calculated using the average exchange rates for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 for the respective currencies, which were US$1=Euro 0.89, US$1=Japanese Yen 112, US$1=Chinese Yuan 6.76 and US$1=Russian Ruble 58.
Loss (gain) on foreign exchange. We incurred a foreign exchange gain of $6.2 million in 2018 as compared to a loss of $14.5 million in 2017. The change was primarily attributable to the depreciation of the Euro as compared to the U.S. Dollar, which was partially offset by depreciation of the Chinese Yuan as compared to the U.S. Dollar.

Interest income (expense), net. Interest income (expense), net increased to $9.1 million of income in 2018 compared to $0.7 million of income in 2017. The increase of interest income was the result of the repatriation of $522 million of cash during the year from Germany to the United States and improved rate of return on U.S. Dollar denominated investments as compared to Euro denominated investments.
Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $130.2 million in 2018 compared to $204.3 million in 2017, representing an effective tax rate of 24.4% in 2018 and 37.0% in 2017. The decreased effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in the statutory tax rate in the United States from 35% to 21% resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"). Discrete adjustments in 2018 include (i) a decrease to tax expense of $13.3 million calculated at the prior year federal rate of 35% flowing through consolidated income in 2018; and, (iii) an increase in the valuation allowance of $7.4 million primarily for state credits. Discrete adjustments in 2017 include (i) a decrease to tax expense of $14.0 million related to equity based compensation deductions for tax in excess of the deductions reflected in book income and (ii) an increase to tax expense of $48.1 million for a U.S. tax on cumulative foreign earnings as a result of the Tax Act.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to: (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (iii) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (iv) providing an incentive benefit for U.S. income from intangibles (Foreign Derived Intangible Income); (v) increasing U.S. taxable income to include all income earned by foreign subsidiaries in excess of ten percent of the fixed assets in those entities (Global Intangible Low-taxed Income) and (vi) providing for bonus depreciation that will allow for full expensing of qualified property.
Our final calculation of the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax ("Transition Tax") element of the Tax Act is a $43.4 million increase to the tax expense. At December 31, 2017, we calculated a provisional amount of tax for this at $48.1 million and have included a benefit of $4.7 million in 2018 income tax expense to reflect the impact of the decrease in liability. The federal Transition Tax is payable over eight years and $30.3 million of the liability is included in other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2018.
Net income. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation increased by $56.4 million to $404.0 million in 2018 from $347.6 million in 2017. Net income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales increased by 3.0% to 27.7% in 2018 from 24.7% in 2017 due to the factors described above.

Our largest committed credit lines are with Bank of America N.A. and Deutsche Bank AG in the amounts of $50.0 million and $56.1 million (or 50 million Euro as described above), respectively, and neither of them is syndicated. We have initiated negotiations to renew the U.S. revolving line of credit and Euro credit facility, which both mature in 2020. We plan to seek amendments of our credit agreements and notes to modify LIBOR and Euribor reference rates as these rates are phased out as borrowing rates.
We are required to meet certain financial covenants associated with our U.S. revolving line of credit and long-term debt facilities. These covenants, tested quarterly, include a debt service coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio. The debt service coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as required principal and interest payments during the period. Debt service in the calculation is decreased by our cash held in the U.S.A. in excess of $50 million up to a maximum of $250 million. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than three times our trailing twelve-months EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2019.
The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to not take or to delay investments and actions that we might otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt or a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.
See Note 11, "Financing Arrangements" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our facilities and term debt.
The following table presents cash flow activities:

Table of Contents
decreases in net sales and net income, cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges decreased. This decrease has been partially offset by a decrease in the amount invested in working capital. Our largest working capital items typically are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory because of the amount of value added within IPG due to our vertically integrated structure. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes payable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2019 primarily resulted from a decrease in cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges, an increase in cash used by income and taxes payable; partially offset by, a decrease in cash used for inventory, and an increase in cash provided by accounts receivable.
Investing activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $140.0 million and $563.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in 2019 related to $133.5 million for property, plant and equipment and $15.1 million for the acquisition of a business during 2019, net of cash acquired; partially offset by $7.8 million of net proceeds of investments. The cash used in investing activities in 2018 related to $295.0 million of net purchases of investments after the repatriation of cash from our German subsidiary, $160.3 million for property, plant and equipment, and $109.1 million for the acquisition of two businesses during 2018, net of cash acquired.
In 2020, we expect to incur approximately $115 million to $125 million in capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. Capital expenditures include investments in property, facilities and equipment to add capacity worldwide to support anticipated revenue growth. The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. If we obtain financing for certain projects, our cash expenditures would be reduced in the year of expenditure. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period.
Financing activities.    Net cash used in financing activities was $37.1 million and $166.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cash used in financing activities in 2019 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $40.7 million and payments on our long-term borrowings of $3.7 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of amounts disbursed in relation to shares withheld to cover employee income taxes due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan of $7.3 million. The cash used in financing activities in 2018 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $176.1 million and payments on our long-term borrowings of $3.6 million. These cash uses were partially offset by net proceeds of $12.2 million from the exercise of stock options net of amounts disbursed in relation to shares withheld to cover employee income taxes due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit provide us with the financial flexibility to meet our liquidity and capital needs, as well as to complete certain acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities based upon market conditions and the strategic importance and valuation of the target company. We may consider issuing debt to finance acquisitions depending on the timing and size of the acquisition among other reasons. Our future long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors including our level of sales, the impact of economic environment on our sales levels, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of the global sales and marketing activities, government regulation including trade sanctions, the timing and introduction of new products, the need to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products.
Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flow Hedges In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of November 29, 2019, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our ant...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...

Note 11.Commitments and Contingencies Guarantee In 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Legal Matters Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking 94 unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class a...

[") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, which may materially affect our operating results and financial position. We have identified the following items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation: revenue recognition, inventory valuation, warranty, and accounting for income taxes.
Revenue Recognition — Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer occurs in an amount reflecting the consideration that we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve this core principle, we apply the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.

[" to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be raised by the tax authorities. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. At December 31, 2019, we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $11.4 million that, if recognized, would be recorded as a reduction in income tax expense.
Goodwill and Long-lived Asset Impairment — We perform our annual goodwill impairment review as of the first day of our fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Such events and circumstances could include significant and sustained reductions in sales volume, margin, profitability or cash flows of the reporting unit or changes in market dynamics, including technology or product changes. We test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. Intangible assets and other long-lived assets are also subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment.
Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates

Table of Contents
include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. Assumptions used in impairment testing are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances present at each annual and interim impairment test date. Additionally, these assumptions are generally interdependent and do not change in isolation. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change, then one or more of our reporting units might become impaired in the future.

[") ratio. The debt service coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve month ratio of cash flow to debt service that is greater than 1.5:1. Debt service is defined as required principal and interest payments during the period. Debt service in the calculation is decreased by our cash held in the U.S.A. in excess of $50 million up to a maximum of $250 million. Cash flow is defined as EBITDA less unfunded capital expenditures. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than three times our trailing twelve-months EBITDA. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2019.
The financial covenants in our loan documents may cause us to not take or to delay investments and actions that we might otherwise undertake because of limits on capital expenditures and amounts that we can borrow or lease. In the event that we do not comply with any one of these covenants, we would be in default under the loan agreement or loan agreements, which may result in acceleration of the debt, cross-defaults on other debt or a reduction in available liquidity, any of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

The following table presents cash flow activities:

Cash provided by operating activities $ 323,521 $ 393,301
Cash used by investing activities (139,975) (562,999)
Cash used by financing activities (37,067) (166,647)

Operating activities.    Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $69.8 million to $323.5 million in 2019 from $393.3 million in 2018. In 2019, net sales and net income decreased by 10% and 55%, respectively. As there were

44

Table of Contents
decreases in net sales and net income, cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges decreased. This decrease has been partially offset by a decrease in the amount invested in working capital. Our largest working capital items typically are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory because of the amount of value added within IPG due to our vertically integrated structure. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes payable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2019 primarily resulted from a decrease in cash provided by net income after adding back non-cash charges, an increase in cash used by income and taxes payable; partially offset by, a decrease in cash used for inventory, and an increase in cash provided by accounts receivable.
Investing activities.    Net cash used in investing activities was $140.0 million and $563.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in 2019 related to $133.5 million for property, plant and equipment and $15.1 million for the acquisition of a business during 2019, net of cash acquired; partially offset by $7.8 million of net proceeds of investments. The cash used in investing activities in 2018 related to $295.0 million of net purchases of investments after the repatriation of cash from our German subsidiary, $160.3 million for property, plant and equipment, and $109.1 million for the acquisition of two businesses during 2018, net of cash acquired.
In 2020, we expect to incur approximately $115 million to $125 million in capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions. Capital expenditures include investments in property, facilities and equipment to add capacity worldwide to support anticipated revenue growth. The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. If we obtain financing for certain projects, our cash expenditures would be reduced in the year of expenditure. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period.
Financing activities.    Net cash used in financing activities was $37.1 million and $166.6 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cash used in financing activities in 2019 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $40.7 million and payments on our long-term borrowings of $3.7 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by net proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of amounts disbursed in relation to shares withheld to cover employee income taxes due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan of $7.3 million. The cash used in financing activities in 2018 was primarily related to the purchase of treasury stock of $176.1 million and payments on our long-term borrowings of $3.6 million. These cash uses were partially offset by net proceeds of $12.2 million from the exercise of stock options net of amounts disbursed in relation to shares withheld to cover employee income taxes due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit provide us with the financial flexibility to meet our liquidity and capital needs, as well as to complete certain acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities based upon market conditions and the strategic importance and valuation of the target company.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us, such as reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and adopting a territorial tax system. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 22.2%. This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income,...
