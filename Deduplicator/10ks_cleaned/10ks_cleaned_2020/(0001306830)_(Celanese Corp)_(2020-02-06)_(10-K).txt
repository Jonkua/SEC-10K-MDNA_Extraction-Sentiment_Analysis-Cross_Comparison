Consolidated Results
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net sales decreased $858 million, or 12.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------
• lower pricing in our Acetyl Chain segment;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an unfavorable currency impact in our Acetyl Chain and Engineered Materials segments; and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower volume in our Engineered Materials segment, primarily due to slower global economic conditions and customer destocking.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $63 million, or 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower incentive compensation costs and project spending of $48 million in our Other Activities segment.

Operating profit decreased $500 million, or 37.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to:

- -----------------------------------------------
• lower Net sales across all of our segments; and

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an unfavorable impact to Other (charges) gains, net. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a reserve of $89 million in our Other Activities segment as a result of information learned from the European Commission's competition law investigation involving certain subsidiaries of Celanese with respect to certain past ethylene purchases. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an $83 million long-lived asset impairment loss in our Acetate Tow segment related to the closure of our acetate flake manufacturing operations in Ocotlán, Mexico. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Dispositions and Plant Closures and Note 18 - Other (Charges) Gains, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information;

partially offset by:

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• lower raw material costs within our Acetyl Chain segment; and

- --------------------
• lower SG&A expenses.

On September 21, 2019, a localized fire occurred at our Clear Lake, Texas facility, resulting in damage to the carbon monoxide production unit, for which we recorded accelerated depreciation expense, fixed overhead, clean-up and repair costs of approximately $39 million in our Acetyl Chain segment during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates decreased $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in equity investment in earnings of $28 million from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate, primarily as a result of plant turnaround activity and lower pricing for methanol; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in equity investment in earnings of $20 million from our Polyplastics Co., Ltd. ("Polyplastics") strategic affiliate as a result of softer market conditions in China.

Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expense decreased $42 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in recognized actuarial loss of $78 million as a result of higher asset returns, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations from 3.8% to 2.8%. See Note 15 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 13% compared to 19% for the year ended 2018. The lower effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to a valuation allowance provided against Luxembourg net operating loss carryforwards in 2018. In addition, the 2019 effective income tax rate benefited from the favorable impact of a 2019 release of valuation allowances due to higher projected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards. See Note 19 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found in Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower pricing for most of our products, primarily due to reduced customer demand in Asia, an overall deflationary environment for raw materials, and limited outage and curtailment activity;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an unfavorable currency impact, primarily related to a weaker Euro relative to the US dollar; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower volume due to reduced customer demand for acetic acid in all regions, mostly offset by higher volume for VAM due to expansion in the western hemisphere.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and dividends from our portfolio of strategic investments. In addition, as of December 31, 2019 we have $978 million available for borrowing under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and $5 million available under our accounts receivable securitization facility to assist, if required, in meeting our working capital needs and other contractual obligations.
While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we continue to believe we will have available resources to meet our liquidity requirements, including debt service, for the next twelve months. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be required to use other means available to us such as increasing our borrowings, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, seeking additional capital or seeking to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels.
Total cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million in 2020 primarily due to additional investments in growth opportunities in our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain segments.
On a stand-alone basis, Celanese and its immediate 100% owned subsidiary, Celanese US, have no material assets other than the stock of their subsidiaries and no independent external operations of their own. Accordingly, they generally depend on the cash flow of their subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to Celanese and Celanese US in order to meet their obligations, including their obligations under senior credit facilities and senior notes and to pay dividends on our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock").
We are subject to capital controls and exchange restrictions imposed by the local governments in certain jurisdictions where we operate, such as China, India and Indonesia. Capital controls impose limitations on our ability to exchange currencies, repatriate earnings or capital, lend via intercompany loans or create cross-border cash pooling arrangements. Our largest exposure to a country with capital controls is in China. Pursuant to applicable regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, the Chinese government imposes certain currency exchange controls on cash transfers out of China, puts certain limitations on duration, purpose and amount of intercompany loans, and restricts cross-border cash pooling.
Cash Flows
Cash and cash equivalents increased $24 million to $463 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, $391 million of the $463 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Under the TCJA, we have incurred a prior year charge associated with the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings, including foreign held cash. These funds are largely accessible, if needed in the US to fund operations. See Note 19 - Income Taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018

• Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $104 million to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $1.6 billion for the same period in 2018. Net cash provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased primarily due to:

- ---------------------------
• a decrease in net earnings;

partially offset by:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• favorable trade working capital of $303 million, primarily due to a decrease in trade receivables and inventory. Trade receivables decreased due to timing of collections. Inventory decreased as a result of inventory build-up for plant turnarounds which occurred in the prior year, as well as lower costs for raw materials and the impact of the localized fire at our Clear Lake, Texas facility in the current year.

• Senior Credit Facilities

On January 7, 2019, Celanese, Celanese US and certain subsidiary borrowers entered into a new senior credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") consisting of a $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (with a letter of credit sublimit), maturing in 2024. The Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Celanese, Celanese US and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries ("the Subsidiary Guarantors"). We borrowed $1.3 billion and repaid $1.1 billion under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2019.

5.875% Notes May 2011 $400 5.875 June 15 December 15 June 15, 2021

The Senior Notes were issued by Celanese US and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Celanese and the Subsidiary Guarantors. Celanese US may redeem some or all of each of the Senior Notes, prior to their respective maturity dates, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus a "make-whole" premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date.
On May 8, 2019, Celanese US completed an offering of the 3.500% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 3.500% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.895%. Net proceeds from the sale of the 3.500% Notes were used to redeem in full the 3.250% Notes, to repay $156 million of outstanding borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the issuance of the 3.500% Notes, we entered into a cross-currency swap to effectively convert our fixed-rate US dollar denominated debt under the 3.500% Notes, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate Euro denominated debt.
In November 2018, Celanese US completed an offering of the 2.125% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 2.125% Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The 2.125% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.231%. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2.125% Notes were used to repay $463 million of our senior unsecured term loan and for general corporate purposes.

- ----------------------------
• Other Financing Arrangements

In June 2018, we entered into a factoring agreement with a global financial institution to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer. We have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized $257 million and $117 million of accounts receivable under this factoring agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our US accounts receivable securitization facility was amended on July 8, 2019 to extend the maturity date to July 6, 2020. We borrowed $112 million and repaid $74 million under this facility during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, events of default and change of control provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. We are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of December 31, 2019.
See Note 14 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
Share Capital
On February 5, 2020, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.62 per share on our Common Stock amounting to $74 million. The cash dividend will be paid on February 28, 2020 to holders of record as of February 18, 2020.
Our Board of Directors has authorized the aggregate repurchase of $5.4 billion of our Common Stock since February 2008. These authorizations give management discretion in determining the timing and conditions under which shares may be repurchased. This repurchase program does not have an expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we

(4) Unconditional purchase obligations primarily represent the take-or-pay provisions included in certain long-term purchase agreements. We do not expect to incur material losses under these arrangements. These amounts, obtained via a survey of Celanese, also include other purchase obligations such as maintenance and service agreements, energy and utility agreements, consulting contracts, software agreements and other miscellaneous agreements and contracts.

Contractual Guarantees and Commitments
As of December 31, 2019, we have standby letters of credit of $28 million and bank guarantees of $17 million outstanding, which are irrevocable obligations of an issuing bank that ensure payment to third parties in the event that certain subsidiaries fail to perform in accordance with specified contractual obligations. The likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these agreements.
See Note 14 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the guarantees under our Senior Notes and Credit Agreement.

See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk for further information.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results.
We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results. See Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

- -----------------------------------
• Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets
We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are either our operating business segments or one level below our operating business segments for which discrete financial information is available and for which operating results are regularly reviewed by business segment management and the chief operating decision maker. Our reporting units include our engineered materials, acetate tow, food ingredients, emulsion polymers and intermediate chemistry businesses. We assess the recoverability of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually during the third quarter of our fiscal year using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
When assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may first assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of multiple factors, including the current operating environment, financial performance and market considerations. After assessing qualitative factors, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, then performing a quantitative assessment is not required. If an initial qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset, a quantitative analysis will be performed. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and proceed directly to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances.
In performing a quantitative analysis, recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. Use of a discounted cash flow model is common practice in assessing impairment in the absence of available transactional market evidence to determine the fair value. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates, growth rates, tax rates, cash flow projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. We may engage third-party valuation consultants to assist with this process. The valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches (market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis) and the discounted cash flow approach. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"). The WACC considers market and industry data as well as company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each reporting unit. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates. If the calculated fair value is less than the current carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. An impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit but may indicate certain long-lived and amortizable intangible assets associated with the reporting unit may require additional impairment testing.

 45

Table of Contents

Management tests other indefinite-lived intangible assets quantitatively utilizing the relief from royalty method under the income approach to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite-lived intangible asset. The relief from royalty method estimates our theoretical royalty savings from ownership of the intangible asset. Key assumptions used in this model include discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates, tax rates, sales projections and terminal value rates. Discount rates, royalty rates, growth rates and sales projections are the assumptions most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates used are similar to the rates estimated by the WACC considering any differences in company-specific risk factors. Royalty rates are established by management and are periodically substantiated by third-party valuation consultants. Operational management, considering industry and company-specific historical and projected data, develops growth rates and sales projections associated with each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales projections beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and low long-term growth rates.
Valuation methodologies utilized to evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment were consistent with prior periods. We periodically engage third-party valuation consultants to assist us with this process. Specific assumptions discussed above are updated at the date of each test to consider current industry and company-specific risk factors from the perspective of a market participant. The current business environment is subject to evolving market conditions and requires significant management judgment to interpret the potential impact to our assumptions. To the extent that changes in the current business environment result in adjusted management projections, impairment losses may occur in future periods.
See Note 11 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

- -------------------------
• Environmental Liabilities

We manufacture and sell a diverse line of chemical products throughout the world. Accordingly, our operations are subject to various hazards incidental to the production of industrial chemicals including the use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of hazardous materials. We recognize losses and accrue liabilities relating to environmental matters if available information indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Depending on the nature of the site, we accrue through 15 years, unless we have government orders or other agreements that extend beyond 15 years. We estimate environmental liabilities on a case-by-case basis using the most current status of available facts, existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. Recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.
An environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, cleanup costs, costs related to soil and water contamination resulting from tank ruptures and post-remediation monitoring costs. These undiscounted liabilities do not take into account any claims or recoveries from insurance. The measurement of environmental liabilities is based on our periodic estimate of what it will cost to perform each of the elements of the remediation effort. We utilize third parties to assist in the management and development of cost estimates for our sites. Changes to environmental regulations or other factors affecting environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur.
See Note 16 - Environmental in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

- -------------------
• Benefit Obligations

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis. Various assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of the employee benefit plans. These assumptions include the discount rate, compensation levels, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and trends in health care costs. In addition, actuarial consultants use factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate the projected benefit obligation. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net periodic benefit cost recorded in future periods.
Pension assumptions are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is required to be remeasured. Assumptions are reviewed on a plan and country-specific basis by third-party actuaries and senior management. Such assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook.
See Note 15 - Benefit Obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

- ------------------
• Loss Contingencies

When determinable, we accrue contingent losses for matters that are probable of occurring for which a loss amount can be reasonably estimated. For certain potentially material loss contingency matters, we are sometimes unable to estimate and accrue a loss deemed probable of occurring. For such matters, we disclose an estimate of the possible loss, range of loss or a statement that such estimate cannot be made.
Because our evaluation and assessment of critical facts and circumstances surrounding a contingent loss matter is in advance of the matter's final determination, there is an inherent subjectivity and unpredictability involved in estimating, accounting for and reporting contingent losses. Generally, the less progress made in the resolution of a contingent loss matter or the broader the range of potential outcomes, the more difficult it is for us to estimate, accrue and report a loss. For example, we may disclose certain information about a plaintiff's legal claim against us that is alleged in the plaintiff's pleadings or otherwise publicly available. While information of this type may provide more insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it might not necessarily be indicative of our estimate of probable or possible loss. In addition, some of our contingent loss exposures may be eligible for reimbursement under the provisions of our insurance coverage. We do not consider the potential availability of insurance coverage in determining our probable or possible loss estimates. As a result of these factors among others, our ultimate contingent loss exposure may be higher or lower, and possibly materially so, than our recorded probable loss accruals and disclosures of possible losses.
See Note 24 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

- ------------
• Income Taxes

We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance as needed. In forming our judgment regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and tax attribute carryforwards, we give weight to positive and negative evidence based on the extent to which the forms of evidence can be objectively verified. We attach the most weight to historical earnings due to its verifiable nature. Weight is attached to tax planning strategies if the strategies are prudent and feasible and implementable without significant obstacles. Less weight is attached to forecasted future earnings due to its subjective nature, and expected timing of reversal of taxable temporary differences is given little weight unless the reversal of taxable and deductible temporary differences coincide. Valuation allowances are established primarily on net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets in the US, Luxembourg, Spain, China, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Canada and France. We have appropriately reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.
The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and management judgment. If actual results differ from the estimates made by management in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or Other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset. In addition, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties.

The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments. Our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018
Net sales decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• lower volume within our base business driven by slower global economic conditions and customer destocking; and

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• an unfavorable currency impact resulting from a weaker Euro relative to the US dollar.

Operating profit decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to:

- ----------------
• lower Net sales;

partially offset by:

- -------------------------------------------------------

Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates decreased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in equity investment in earnings of $28 million from our Ibn Sina strategic affiliate, primarily as a result of plant turnaround activity and lower pricing for methanol; and

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• a decrease in equity investment in earnings of $20 million from our Polyplastics strategic affiliate as a result of softer market conditions in China.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and includes many provisions applicable to us, such as reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and adopting a territorial tax system. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal 2018, our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate was 22.2%. This was the result of using the tax rate of 35% for the first month of fiscal 2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the remaining eleven months of fiscal 2018. The Tax Act also required us to incur a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income,...

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results.
We believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present in the current economic environment. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are also essential to understanding our reported and future operating results. See Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

• Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Assets
We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit using June 30 balances or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable.
When assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other assessing qualitative factors, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, to a quantitative analysis depending on the facts and circumstances.
In performing a quantitative analysis, recoverability of goodwill for each reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow to assist with this process. The valuation consultants assess fair value by equally weighting a combination of two market approaches (market multiple analysis and comparable transaction analysis) and the discounted cash flow approach. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital ("]:

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange.

On May 8, 2019, Celanese US completed an offering of the 3.500% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 3.500% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.895%. Net proceeds from the sale of the 3.500% Notes were used to redeem in full the 3.250% Notes, to repay $156 million of outstanding borrowings under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. In connection with the issuance of the 3.500% Notes, we entered into a cross-currency swap to effectively convert our fixed-rate US dollar denominated debt under the 3.500% Notes, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate Euro denominated debt.
In November 2018, Celanese US completed an offering of the 2.125% Notes in a public offering registered under the Securities Act. The 2.125% Notes were issued under a base indenture dated May 6, 2011. The 2.125% Notes were issued at a discount to par at a price of 99.231%. Net proceeds from the sale of the 2.125% Notes were used to repay $463 million of our senior unsecured term loan and for general corporate purposes.

• Other Financing Arrangements

In June 2018, we entered into a factoring agreement with a global financial institution to sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are treated as a sale and are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreement transfers effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer. We have no continuing involvement in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized $257 million and $117 million of accounts receivable under this factoring agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our US accounts receivable securitization facility was amended on July 8, 2019 to extend the maturity date to July 6, 2020. We borrowed $112 million and repaid $74 million under this facility during the year ended December 31, 2019.
Our material financing arrangements contain customary covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios, events of default and change of control provisions. Failure to comply with these covenants, or the occurrence of any other event of default, could result in acceleration of the borrowings and other financial obligations. We are in compliance with all of the covenants related to our debt agreements as of December 31, 2019.
See Note 14 - Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.
