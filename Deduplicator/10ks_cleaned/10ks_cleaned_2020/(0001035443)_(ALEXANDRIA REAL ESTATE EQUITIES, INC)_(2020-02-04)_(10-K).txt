2020 Capital strategy

During 2020, we intend to continue to execute our capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit rating, which will allow us to further improve our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. For further information, refer to the “Projected Results” section below under this Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Consistent with 2019, our capital strategy for 2020 includes the following elements:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Allocate capital to Class A properties located in collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters;

- ---------------------------------------
• Continue to improve our credit profile;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maintain prudent access to diverse sources of capital, which include cash flows from operating activities after dividends, incremental debt supported by our growth in EBITDA, real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, joint venture capital, and other capital such as sales of equity;

- --------------------------------------------------------
• Maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;

- ---------------------------------
• Prudently ladder debt maturities;

- -------------------------------------
• Reduce short-term variable-rate debt;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Prudently manage equity investments to support corporate-level investment strategies;

- -------------------------------------------------
• Maintain significant balance sheet liquidity; and

- ---------------------------------------------
• Maintain a stable and flexible balance sheet.

Given the anticipated delivery of significant incremental EBITDA from our development and redevelopment of new Class A properties, we expect to be able to debt fund a significant portion of construction on a leverage-neutral basis. We expect to continue to maintain access to a diverse source of debt, including unsecured senior notes payable, as well as secured construction loans for our development and redevelopment projects from time to time. We expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of our net operating income on an unencumbered basis to allow for future flexibility for accessing both unsecured and secured debt markets, although we expect traditional secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small component of our capital structure. In addition to debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis, we intend to supplement our remaining capital needs with net cash flows from operating activities, after dividends and proceeds from real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, partial interest sales, and other debt and equity capital.

Improved cost of capital

As part of our capital strategy to continue strengthening our credit profile, we expect to complete and place into service development and redevelopment projects currently under construction, which we expect will deliver significant incremental EBITDA. The expected growth in our EBITDA in 2020 and beyond should allow us to obtain debt funding on a leverage-neutral basis and provide significant capital to fund our development and redevelopment projects. Additionally, the resulting expected improvement in our balance sheet leverage ratio should allow us to access diverse sources of capital, strengthen our credit profile, and reduce our cost of capital. In addition, we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of unencumbered net operating income. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income was 94%.

77

Investments

We present our equity investments at fair value whenever fair value or NAV is readily available. Adjustments for our limited partnership investments represent changes in reported NAV as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. For investments without readily available fair values, we adjust the carrying amount whenever such investments have an observable price change, and further adjustments are not made until another price change, if any, is observed. Refer to Note 7 – “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Results of operations

We present a tabular comparison of items, whether gain or loss, that may facilitate a high-level understanding of our results and provide context for the disclosures included in our annual report on Form 10-K. We believe such tabular presentation promotes a better understanding for investors of the corporate-level decisions made and activities performed that significantly affect comparison of our operating results from period to period. We also believe this tabular presentation will supplement for investors an understanding of our disclosures and real estate operating results. Gains or losses on sales of real estate and impairments of held for sale assets are related to corporate-level decisions to dispose of real estate. Gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on early termination of interest rate hedge agreements, and preferred stock redemption charges are related to corporate-level financing decisions focused on our capital structure strategy. Significant realized and unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments and impairments of real estate and non-real estate investments are not related to the operating performance of our real estate assets as they result from strategic, corporate-level non-real estate investment decisions and external market conditions. Impairments of non-real estate investments are not related to the operating performance of our real estate as they represent the write-down of non-real estate investments when their fair values decline below their respective carrying values due to changes in general market or other conditions outside of our control. Significant items, whether a gain or loss, included in the tabular disclosure, for current periods are described in further detail under this Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K. Items included in net income attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders were as follows:

Income from rentals
Total income from rentals for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $202.1 million, or 15.4%, to $1.5 billion, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of increases in rental revenues and tenant recoveries, as discussed below.

Rental revenues

Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $155.1 million, or 15.3%, to $1.2 billion, compared to $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties aggregating $125.5 million related to 1.6 million RSF of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2018, and 60 operating properties aggregating 4.5 million RSF acquired subsequent to January 1, 2018.

Rental revenues from our Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $29.6 million, or 3.3%, to $927.1 million, compared to $897.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to significant rental rate increases on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since January 1, 2018 and an increase in Same Properties’ occupancy to 96.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, from 96.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to the “Leasing Activity” section under Item 2 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Tenant recoveries

Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $47.0 million, or 15.5%, to $351.1 million, compared to $304.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase is relatively consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses of $64.4 million, or 16.9%, as discussed under “Rental Operations” below. Same Properties’ tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $18.2 million, or 6.5%, primarily due to the increase in recoverable operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, as discussed below. As of December 31, 2019, 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent.

Other income
Other income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $14.4 million and $12.7 million, respectively, primarily consisting of construction management fees and interest income earned during each respective period.

Rental operations
Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $64.4 million, or 16.9%, to $445.5 million, compared to $381.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $43.0 million of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to 1.6 million RSF of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2018, and 60 operating properties aggregating 4.5 million RSF acquired subsequent to January 1, 2018.

Same Properties’ rental operating expenses increased by $21.4 million, or 6.4%, to $353.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the $332.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $6.9 million of the increase was due to the higher tax expense stemming from a new 3.5% gross receipts tax on rental revenues by the city of San Francisco that went into effect on January 1, 2019, and an increase in property tax expense resulting from higher assessed values of certain of our properties in Greater Boston. The remaining $14.5 million increase was mainly a result of the higher repairs and maintenance expenses, payroll, and additional contract services incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019.

General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $18.4 million, or 20.4%, to $108.8 million, compared to $90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Approximately $5 million of the increase reflects incremental leasing costs recognized in expense in the current period, resulting from our adoption of a new accounting standard on leases on January 1, 2019. For a detailed discussion related to this new standard, refer to the “Lease Accounting” section in Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

The remaining increase of approximately $13.4 million of general and administrative expenses was due to a 35.9% increase in our employee headcount since January 1, 2018, to accommodate the continued growth in the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets, including development and redevelopment projects placed into service and properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2018, as discussed under “Income from Rentals” above. As a percentage of net operating income, our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, were 10.0% and 9.6%, respectively.

Refer to Note 11 – “Interest Rate Hedge Agreements” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

83

In anticipation of LIBOR cessation at the end of 2021, we have been actively reducing LIBOR-based borrowings outstanding on our loans. As of December 31, 2019, our only outstanding LIBOR-based debt, excluding debt held by our unconsolidated joint ventures, included an outstanding balance of $384.0 million on our unsecured senior line of credit, which represented approximately 6% of our total debt balance outstanding as of December 31, 2019.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $67.0 million, or 14.0%, to $544.6 million, compared to $477.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to additional depreciation from 1.6 million RSF of development and redevelopment projects placed into service subsequent to January 1, 2018, and 60 operating properties aggregating 4.5 million RSF acquired subsequent to January 1, 2018.

Investment income

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized investment income of $194.6 million, which included $33.2 million of realized gains and $161.5 million of unrealized gains. Realized gains consisted of $50.3 million of realized gains, partially offset by impairment charges of $17.1 million related to investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV. Unrealized gains of $161.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily consisted of increases in fair values of our investments in publicly traded companies. For more information about our investments, refer to Note 7 – “Investments” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report Form 10-K. For our impairments accounting policy, refer to the “Investments” section in Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report From 10-K.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized investment income aggregating $136.7 million, which included $37.1 million of realized gains and $99.6 million of unrealized gains. Realized gains consisted of $42.6 million of realized gains, partially offset by impairment charges of $5.5 million related to investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV. Unrealized gains of $99.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily consisted of observable price increases in our equity investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV aggregating $64.1 million, increases in fair values of our investments in privately held entities that report NAV aggregating $22.4 million, and increases in fair values of our investments in publicly traded companies aggregating $13.1 million.

Sales of real estate assets and impairment charges

During the three months ended June 30, 2019, we classified as held for sale our property at 6138/6150 Nancy Ridge Drive aggregating 56,698 RSF, located in our Sorrento Mesa submarket. In December 2019, we completed the sale of the property for a sales price of $6.6 million, or $117 per RSF, and recognized a gain of $474 thousand.

During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we decided to sell two of our real estate assets aggregating 123,862 RSF located in non-cluster markets to allow for reinvestment of this capital into our highly leased value-creation pipeline. Upon classification as held for sale, we recognized impairment charges aggregating $12.3 million to lower the carrying amounts of these real estate assets to their respective estimated fair value less cost to sell. For additional information, refer to Note 19 – “Assets Classified as Held for Sale” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized an impairment of real estate of $6.3 million related to one land parcel located in Northern Virginia that was classified as held for sale and was subsequently sold during 2018 for a sales price of $6.0 million with no gain or loss.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid early one secured note payable aggregating $106.7 million, which was originally due in 2020 and bore interest at 7.75%, and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7.1 million, including the write-off of unamortized loan fees. Additionally during the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid early the remaining outstanding balance of $193.1 million under our secured construction loan related to 50/60 Binney Street and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $269 thousand. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we also repaid outstanding balance of our unsecured senior bank term loan of $350.0 million and refinanced an aggregate of $950.0 million of unsecured senior notes payable which included $400.0 million of 2.75% unsecured senior notes payable due 2020 and $550.0 million of 4.60% unsecured senior notes payable due 2022. As a result, we recognized losses of $40.2 million related to the early extinguishment of debt, including the write-off of unamortized loan fees.

84

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we amended our unsecured senior line of credit and our unsecured senior bank term loan to, among other changes, extend the maturity dates of each to January 28, 2024. We recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $634 thousand related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees associated with these amendments. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we repaid the remaining $200.0 million and $150.0 million outstanding balances under our 2019 unsecured senior bank term loan and one secured construction loan, respectively, and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $189 thousand and $299 thousand, respectively, related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees.

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our remaining 27.5% ownership interest in the unconsolidated real estate joint venture that owned 360 Longwood Avenue, located in our Longwood Medical Area submarket, and recognized a gain of $35.7 million. This gain is reflected in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in our consolidated statements of operations.

Preferred stock redemption charge

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, 275,000 outstanding shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and recognized a preferred stock redemption charge of $2.6 million. In September 2019, we elected to convert the remaining 2.3 million outstanding shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock. The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock became eligible for mandatory conversion at our discretion, at a set conversion rate of 0.2513 shares of common stock to one share of preferred stock, upon our common stock price exceeding $149.46 per share for the specified period of time required to cause the mandatory conversion. In October 2019, we converted the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into 578 thousand shares of common stock. This conversion was accounted for as an equity transaction, and we did not recognize a gain or loss. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, 402,000 outstanding shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and recognized a preferred stock redemption charge of $4.2 million.

Inflation

We do not believe that our revenues and earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. Refer to the “Inflation” subsection of the “Cash Flows” section under this Item 7 for additional information.

Based on our current view of existing market conditions and certain current assumptions, we present guidance for EPS attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted and funds from operations per share attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted for the year ending December 31, 2020, as set forth in the table below. The tables below also provide a reconciliation of EPS attributable to Alexandria’s common stockholders – diluted, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to funds from operations per share, non-GAAP measure, and other key assumptions included in our updated guidance for the year ending December 31, 2020. There can be no assurance that actual amounts will be materially higher or lower than these expectations. Refer to our discussion of “Forward-Looking Statements” under this Item 1A.

Consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures

We present components of balance sheet and operating results information for the noncontrolling interests’ share of our consolidated real estate joint ventures and for our share of investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures to help investors estimate balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. These amounts are estimated by computing, for each joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, the noncontrolling interest percentage of each financial item to arrive at the cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented. In addition, for our real estate joint ventures that we do not control and do not consolidate, we apply our economic ownership percentage to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) In January 2020, we entered into $1.0 billion of forward equity sales agreements. Including the outstanding forward equity agreements, we had proforma liquidity of $3.4 billion.

We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, scheduled debt maturities, distributions to noncontrolling interests, repurchases/redemptions of preferred stock, and payment of dividends through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic real estate joint venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, commercial paper program, and issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.

89

We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT.

Over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests for investment in development and redevelopment projects and/or acquisitions;

- --------------------------------------------------------------
• Improve credit profile and relative long-term cost of capital;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective real estate asset sales, partial interest sales, non-real estate investment sales, preferred stock, and common stock;

- --------------------------------------------------------
• Maintain commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;

- ----------------------------------------------
• Maintain prudent laddering of debt maturities;

- ------------------------------
• Maintain solid credit metrics;

- ---------------------------------------------
• Maintain significant balance sheet liquidity;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Mitigate variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate bank debt;

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility;

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fund common stock dividends and distributions to noncontrolling interests from net cash provided by operating activities;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects.

The following table presents the availability under our unsecured senior line of credit less amounts outstanding on our commercial paper program; cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash; and investments in publicly traded companies as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):

Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash

As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had $242.7 million and $272.1 million, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from real estate asset sales, non-real estate investment sales, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program, issuances of unsecured notes payable, and issuances of common stock to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, distributions to noncontrolling interests, scheduled debt repayments, acquisitions, and certain capital expenditures, including expenditures related to construction activities.

Cash flows

We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):

----------------------------------------- ----------------------- ---------- ---- ------ ---------- - - ---------- -

 Year Ended December 31,
 2019 2018 Change
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 683,857 $ 570,339 $ 113,518
Net cash used in investing activities $ (3,641,320 ) $ (2,161,760 ) $ (1,479,560 )
Net cash provided by financing activities $ 2,927,482 $ 1,588,433 $ 1,339,049

Operating activities

Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectibility of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our tenants, the timing of completion of development and redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions and dispositions of operating properties. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased to $683.9 million, compared to $570.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) cash flows generated from our highly leased development and redevelopment projects recently placed into service, (ii) income-producing acquisitions since January 1, 2018, and (iii) increases in rental rates on lease renewals and re-leasing of space since January 1, 2018.

Investing activities

Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, consisted of the following (in thousands):

--------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- --------- ------------------- --------- --------- - - ---------

Net cash used in investing activities $ 3,641,320 $ 2,161,760 $ 1,479,560

The change in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, is primarily due to an increased use of cash for property acquisitions and for investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, partially offset by proceeds from sale of investments. Refer to Note 3 – “Investments in Real Estate” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information.

Net cash provided by financing activities $ 2,927,482 $ 1,588,433 $ 1,339,049

Inflation

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on a consumer price index or other indices. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flows or earnings from real estate operations are subject to significant risks from inflation. A period of inflation, however, could cause an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured senior line of credit and secured construction loans held by our unconsolidated joint ventures.

92

Capital resources

We expect that our principal liquidity needs for the year ending December 31, 2020, will be satisfied by the following multiple sources of capital, as shown in the table below. There can be no assurance that our sources and uses of capital will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations.

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) In January 2020, we entered into forward equity sales agreements to sell an aggregate of 6.9 million shares of our common stock (including the exercise of underwriters’ option) at a public offering price of $155.00 per share, before underwriting discounts. We expect to settle these forward equity sales agreements in 2020 and receive proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion, to be further adjusted as provided in the sales agreements.

The key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above include a favorable capital market environment, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. Our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under Item 1A and under this Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K. We expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis.

Sources of capital

Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends

We expect to retain $200.0 million to $240.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock dividends, and distributions to noncontrolling interests. For purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences. For the year ending December 31, 2020, we expect our recently delivered projects, our highly pre-leased value-creation projects expected to be completed, along with contributions from Same Properties and recently acquired properties, to contribute significant increases in rental revenue, net operating income, and cash flows. We anticipate significant contractual near-term growth in annual cash rents of $55 million related to the commencement of contractual rents on the projects recently placed into service that are near the end of their initial free rent period. Refer to the “Cash Flows” section under this Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Debt

In February 2019, S&P Global Ratings raised our corporate issuer credit rating to BBB+/Stable from BBB/Positive. The rating upgrade reflects our consistently strong operating performance and continued successful delivery of our value-creation pipeline.

The table below reflects the maximum borrowings, outstanding balances, applicable rates, maturity dates, and facility fees for our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program as of December 31, 2019:

------------------------------- ------------------ ---------------------- --------------- --------------- ------------

 Maximum Borrowings Outstanding Balance(1) Applicable Rate Maturity Date Facility Fee
Commercial paper program $750 million $— N/A N/A N/A
Unsecured senior line of credit $2.2 billion $384 million L+0.825% January 2024(2) 0.15%

--- -------------------------------------------
(1) Excludes loan fees as of December 31, 2019.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------
(2) Includes two six-month extension options that we control.

In September 2019, we established a commercial paper program with the ability to issue up to $750.0 million of commercial paper notes with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. Our commercial paper program is backed by our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance on our commercial paper program. We use borrowings under the program to fund short-term capital needs. The notes issued under our commercial paper program are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market. They are typically issued at a discount to par, representing a yield to maturity dictated by market conditions at the time of issuance.

We use our unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a “Eurocurrency Rate,” a “LIBOR Floating Rate,” or a “Base Rate” specified in the amended unsecured senior line of credit agreement plus, in any case, the Applicable Margin. The Eurocurrency Rate specified in the amended unsecured senior line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to either (i) the LIBOR or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the Company for loans denominated in a LIBOR quoted currency (i.e., U.S. dollars, euro, sterling, or yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to Canadian dollar bankers’ acceptances for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, (iii) the Bank Bill Swap Reference Bid rate for loans denominated in Australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-LIBOR quoted currency (other than Canadian or Australian dollars). The LIBOR Floating Rate means, for any day, one month LIBOR, or a successor rate thereto as agreed to by the administrative agent and the Company for loans denominated in U.S. dollars. The Base Rate means, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its “prime rate,” and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%. Our unsecured senior line of credit contains a feature that allows lenders to competitively bid on the interest rate for borrowings under the facility. This may result in an interest rate that is below the stated rate. In addition to the cost of borrowing, the unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.15% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding.

We expect to fund a portion of our capital needs in 2020 from the issuance of unsecured senior notes payable and from borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program.

 Note 3 – “Investments in Real Estate” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Our $350.0 million of 3.80% unsecured senior notes payable and our $200.0 million of 4.00% unsecured senior notes payable issued in March 2019 were allocated to fund recently completed and future eligible green development and redevelopment projects, and to the repayment of the outstanding balance of $193.1 million under our secured construction loan related to 50/60 Binney Street, a recently completed Class A property, which was awarded LEED® Gold certification.

The proceeds from our $300.0 million of 4.85% unsecured senior notes payable issued in March 2019 were primarily allocated to fund acquisitions completed during 2019. Refer to Note 3 – “Investments in Real Estate” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this report for additional information.

The proceeds from our $750.0 million of 3.375% unsecured senior notes payable issued in July 2019 and partial proceeds from our $700.0 million of 4.00% unsecured senior notes payable, which were issued in two tranches of $500.0 million during July 2019 and $200.0 million during September 2019, were primarily used to refinance $400.0 million of 2.75% unsecured senior notes payable due 2020 and $550.0 million of 4.60% unsecured senior notes payable due 2022, pursuant to a partial cash tender offer completed on July 17, 2019. We tendered $318.6 million, or 79.64%, of our outstanding 2.75% unsecured senior notes payable, and $384.9 million, including $135 thousand tendered via guaranteed deliveries, or 69.98%, of our outstanding 4.60% unsecured senior notes payable. A subsequent call for redemption for the remaining outstanding amounts was settled on August 16, 2019. Additionally, a portion of the proceeds from our $750.0 million of 3.375% unsecured senior notes payable, $700.0 million of 4.00% unsecured senior notes payable, and $400.0 million of 2.75% unsecured senior notes payable issued in September 2019 were used to complete the repayment of the remaining principal balance on our unsecured senior bank term loan of $350.0 million.

As a result of our debt issuances and repayments of debt, we recognized losses of $47.6 million related to the early extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2019, including $40.2 million related to the refinancing of our 2.75% unsecured senior notes payable due 2020 and 4.60% unsecured senior notes payable and the repayment of our unsecured senior bank term loan.

95

In September 2019, we established a commercial paper program, which received credit ratings of A-2 from S&P Global Ratings and Prime-2 from Moody’s Investors Service. Under this program, we have the ability to issue up to $750.0 million of commercial paper notes with varying maturity lengths, with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. Our commercial paper program is backed by our $2.2 billion unsecured senior line of credit, and at all times we expect to retain a minimum undrawn amount of borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit equal to any outstanding balance on our commercial paper program. We use and expect to continue to use net proceeds from the issuances of the commercial paper notes for general working capital and other general corporate purposes. General corporate purposes may include the repayment of other debt and selective development, redevelopment, or acquisition of properties. The commercial paper notes sold during the year ended December 31, 2019, were issued at a yield to maturity of between 1.83% and 2.29%. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program.

Refer to Note 10 – “Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our unsecured senior notes payable.

Proactive management of transition away from LIBOR

LIBOR has been used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including variable-rate debt and interest rate swap contracts. However, it is expected that LIBOR will no longer be used after 2021. To address the increased risk of LIBOR discontinuation, in the U.S. the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) was established to help ensure the successful transition from LIBOR. In June 2017, the ARRC selected the SOFR, a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR. We have been closely monitoring developments related to the transition away from LIBOR and have implemented numerous proactive measures to minimize the potential impact of the transition to the Company, specifically:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We have proactively reduced outstanding LIBOR-based borrowings under our unsecured senior bank term loans and secured construction loans through repayments. From January 2017 to December 2018, we retired approximately $942.0 million of such debt.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During the year ended December 31, 2019, we further reduced our exposure to LIBOR as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Repaid the $350.0 million balance and extinguished our unsecured senior bank term loan.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Terminated our LIBOR-based interest rate hedge agreements aggregating $350.0 million in conjunction with the extinguishment of our unsecured senior bank term loan. As a result, we had no outstanding interest rate hedge agreements as of December 31, 2019.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Fully repaid outstanding balances aggregating $193.1 million under our LIBOR-based construction loans.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During the three months ended September 30, 2019, we established a commercial paper program, under which we have the ability to issue up to $750.0 million of commercial paper notes, which bear interest at short-term fixed rates, with a maximum maturity of 397 days from the date of issuance. Our commercial paper program is not subjected to LIBOR and is used for funding short-term working capital needs. As of December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We continue to prudently manage outstanding borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, which represented less than 6% of our total debt balance outstanding as of December 31, 2019. Excluding LIBOR-based debt held by our unconsolidated joint ventures, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit represented our only LIBOR-based debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Our unsecured senior line of credit contains fallback language generally consistent with the ARRC’s Amendment Approach, which provides a streamlined amendment approach for negotiating a benchmark replacement and introduces clarity with respect to the fallback trigger events and an adjustment to be applied to the successor rate.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We continue to monitor developments by the ARRC and other governing bodies involved in LIBOR transition.

For additional information, refer to Note 10 – “Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt” and Note 11 – “Interest Rate Hedge Agreements” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Real estate dispositions and common equity

We expect to continue the disciplined execution of select sales of operating assets. Future sales will provide an important source of capital to fund a portion of our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. We may also consider additional sales of partial interests in core Class A properties and/or development projects. For 2020, we expect real estate dispositions, partial interest sales, and issuances of common equity ranging from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. The amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of EBITDA associated with the assets sold. In addition, the amount of common equity issued will be subject to market conditions.

For additional information, refer to the “Sales of Partial Interests and Formation of Consolidated Joint Ventures in 2019” section in Note 4 – “Consolidated and Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

96

Common equity transactions

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued 8.7 million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of $1.2 billion, as follows:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred initial issuance costs aggregating $700 thousand in connection with these forward equity sales agreements.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 31, 2019, we had approximately $22.5 million of gross proceeds available to be issued under our ATM program. We expect to file a new ATM program in the first quarter of 2020.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The proceeds were used to fund construction projects and to fund 2019 acquisitions.

In January 2020, we entered into forward equity sales agreements to sell an aggregate of 6.9 million shares of our common stock (including the exercise of an underwriters’ option) at a public offering price of $155.00 per share, before underwriting discounts. We expect to settle these forward equity sales agreements in 2020, and receive proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion, to be further adjusted as provided in the sales agreements, which will fund pending and recently completed acquisitions and the construction of our highly leased development projects.

Other sources

Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued, from time to time, at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including, as necessary, to balance our use of incremental debt capital.

Additionally, we hold interests, together with joint venture partners, in joint ventures that we consolidate in our financial statements. These joint venture partners may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received $1.0 billion in contributions from and sales of noncontrolling interests.

Uses of capital

Summary of capital expenditures

One of our primary uses of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction of properties. We currently have projects in our growth pipeline aggregating 2.1 million RSF of Class A office/laboratory and tech office space undergoing construction, 6.3 million RSF of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, and 3.8 million SF of future development projects in North America. We incur capitalized construction costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and other construction activities. We also incur additional capitalized project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project, during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. Refer to the “New Class A Development and Redevelopment Properties: Projects Under Construction” and “Summary of Capital Expenditures” subsections of the “Investments in Real Estate” section under Item 2 in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our capital expenditures.

We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, of $88.6 million and $66.2 million, respectively, is classified in investments in real estate. Indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. We capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction projects, which aggregated $43.2 million and $32.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in our value-creation pipeline projects undergoing construction and pre-construction activities aggregating 15 projects with 3.7 million RSF in 2019 over 2018. Pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements. The advancement of pre-construction efforts is focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. Should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

97

Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We use third-party brokers to assist in our leasing activity, who are paid on a contingent basis upon successful leasing. We are required to capitalize initial direct costs related to successful leasing transactions that result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction and would not have been incurred had that lease transaction not been successfully executed. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we capitalized total initial direct leasing costs of $73.6 million. Effective January 1, 2019, costs that we incur to negotiate or arrange a lease regardless of its outcome, such as fixed employee compensation, tax, or legal advice to negotiate lease terms, and other costs, are expensed as incurred.

Acquisitions

Refer to the “Acquisitions” section in Note 3 – “Investments in Real Estate” and to Note 4 – “Consolidated and Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for detailed information on our acquisitions.

7.00% Series D cumulative convertible preferred stock repurchases and conversion

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, 275,000 shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at an aggregate price of $9.2 million, or $33.60 per share, and recognized a preferred stock redemption charge of $2.6 million. Additionally, we elected to convert 2.3 million outstanding shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock. The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock became eligible for mandatory conversion at our discretion, at a set conversion rate of 0.2513 shares of common stock to one share of preferred stock, upon our common stock price exceeding $149.46 per share for the specified period of time required to cause the mandatory conversion. We converted the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into 578 thousand shares of common stock. This conversion was accounted for as an equity transaction, and we did not recognize a gain or loss. As of December 31, 2019, we had no shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding.

Dividends

During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we paid the following dividends (in thousands):

--------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- ------- ---- ----- ------ ------- ------ - - ------

 Year Ended December 31,
 2019 2018 Change
Common stock dividends $ 447,029 $ 380,632 $ 66,397
7.00% Series D cumulative convertible preferred stock dividends 4,141 5,207 (1,066 )
 $ 451,170 $ 385,839 $ 65,331

The increase in dividends paid on our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was primarily due to an increase in number of common shares outstanding subsequent to January 1, 2018, as a result of issuances of common stock under our ATM program and settlement of forward equity sales agreements, and partially due to the increase in the related dividends to $3.94 per common share paid during the year ended December 31, 2019, from $3.66 per common share paid during the year ended December 31, 2018.

The decrease in dividends paid on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, was due to a decrease in number of shares outstanding as a result of the repurchase of 402,000 and 275,000 outstanding shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock in 2018 and 2019, respectively, and the conversion of the remaining 2.3 million outstanding shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.

99

Estimated interest payments

Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including interest payment dates and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2019, 94% of our debt was fixed-rate debt. For additional information regarding our debt, refer to Note 10 – “Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Ground lease obligations

Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2019, included leases for 31 of our properties, which accounted for approximately 11% of our total number of properties. Excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in 2036 with a net book value of $7.7 million as of December 31, 2019, our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms ranging from approximately 34 to 95 years, including extension options. Refer to Note 5 – “Leases” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information on our ground leases.

As of December 31, 2019, the remaining contractual payments under ground and office lease agreements in which we are the lessee aggregated $674.7 million and $25.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, all of our ground and office leases in which we are the lessee were classified as operating leases. Under the new lease accounting standard effective on January 1, 2019, described in detail under the “Lease Accounting” section in Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K, we are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a related liability to account for our future obligations under operating lease arrangements in which we are the lessee. The operating lease liability is measured based on the present value of the remaining lease payments, including payments during the term under our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. The right-of-use asset is equal to the corresponding operating lease liability, adjusted for the initial direct leasing cost and any other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, as well as adjustments to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of an acquired lease when compared with market terms at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, the present value of the remaining contractual payments, aggregating $699.9 million, under our operating lease agreements, including our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, was $271.8 million, which is classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term of operating leases in which we are the lessee was approximately 44 years, and the weighted-average discount rate was 5.24%. Our corresponding operating lease right-of-use assets, adjusted for initial direct leasing costs and other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, aggregated $264.7 million. We classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

Commitments

As of December 31, 2019, remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $1.1 billion. We expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We may have the ability to cease the construction of certain properties, which would result in the reduction of our commitments. In addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations aggregating $11.1 million primarily related to construction projects.

We are committed to funding approximately $229.5 million for non-real estate investments primarily related to our investments in limited partnerships. Our funding commitments expire at various dates over the next 12 years, with a weighted-average expiration of 8.6 years as of December 31, 2019.

Exposure to environmental liabilities

In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties.

Critical accounting policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.

We continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Changes in estimates or policies applied could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

REIT compliance

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.

Investments in real estate

Recognition of real estate acquired

We evaluate each acquisition of real estate or in-substance real estate (including equity interests in entities that predominantly hold real estate assets) to determine whether the integrated set of assets and activities acquired meets the definition of a business and needs to be accounted for as a business combination. An acquisition of an integrated set of assets and activities that does not meet the definition of a business is accounted for as an asset acquisition.

For acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate that are accounted for as business combinations, we allocate the acquisition consideration (excluding acquisition costs) to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, noncontrolling interests, and previously existing ownership interests at fair value as of the acquisition date. Assets include intangible assets such as tenant relationships, acquired in-place leases, and favorable intangibles associated with in-place leases in which we are the lessor. Liabilities include unfavorable intangibles associated with in-place leases in which we are the lessor. In addition, for acquired in-place finance or operating leases in which we are the lessee, acquisition consideration is allocated to lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets, adjusted to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of the lease when compared with market terms. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the fair value of the net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill (bargain purchase gain). Acquisition costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred.

Generally, we expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e., land, buildings, and related intangible assets). The accounting model for asset acquisitions is similar to the accounting model for business combinations except that the acquisition consideration (including acquisition costs) is allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Any excess (deficit) of the consideration transferred relative to the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is allocated to the individual assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values. As a result, asset acquisitions do not result in the recognition of goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. Incremental and external direct acquisition costs (such as legal and third-party services) are capitalized.

We exercise judgment to determine the key assumptions used to allocate the purchase price of real estate acquired among its components. The allocation of the consideration to the various components of properties acquired during the year can have an effect on our net income due to the useful depreciable and amortizable lives applicable to each component and the recognition of the related depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We apply judgment in utilizing available comparable market information to assess relative fair value. We assess the relative fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on available comparable market information, including estimated replacement costs, rental rates, and recent market transactions. In addition, we may use estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property.

The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of fair value on an “as if vacant” basis. The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred in the execution of similar leases under the market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. The value of above-market lease assets and below-market lease liabilities reflects the difference between (i) the contractual rents to be paid over the remaining term for each in-place lease and (ii) the estimated current market lease rates using available comparable market information and tenant credit quality. If there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term of an in-place lease, we evaluate intangible factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. When we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider the option in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period. We also recognize the relative fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity.

We completed acquisitions of 47 properties for a total purchase price of $2.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions, and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair value of the asset acquired and liabilities assumed.

102

Depreciation and amortization

The values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the respective ground lease term, estimated useful life, or up to 40 years, for buildings and building improvements; an estimated life, or up to 20 years, for land improvements; the respective lease term or estimated useful life for tenant improvements; and the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life for equipment. The values of acquired in-place leases and associated favorable intangibles (i.e., acquired above-market leases) are classified in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases, as a reduction of income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. The values of unfavorable intangibles (i.e., acquired below-market leases associated with acquired in-place leases are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases, as an increase in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.

Capitalized project costs

We capitalize project costs, including pre-construction costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction of a project. Capitalization of development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, pre-construction, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Should development, redevelopment, pre-construction, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Properties classified as held for sale

A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale.

If the disposal of a property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major parts of an entity, then the operations of the property, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. The disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift and therefore will typically not meet the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation.

Impairment of long-lived assets

Prior to and subsequent to the end of each quarter, we review current activities and changes in the business conditions of all of our long-lived assets to determine the existence of any triggering events or impairment indicators requiring an impairment analysis. If triggering events or impairment indicators are identified, we review an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.

Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, and intangibles, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration.

Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation or amortization is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period

103

that the asset is expected to be held and used. We may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives.

We use the held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. The held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model. Under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale.

Equity investments

We hold investments in publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, technology, and agtech industries. As a REIT, we generally limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%.

Our investments in publicly traded companies are classified as investments with readily determinable fair values and are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The fair values for our investments in publicly traded companies are determined based on sales prices/quotes available on securities exchanges and therefore generally require no judgment to determine fair value. Investments in privately held entities that report NAV per share, such as our privately held investments in limited partnerships, are carried at fair value using NAV as a practical expedient, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As a result, fair value estimation for these investments generally requires limited judgment. Investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV are measured at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes recognized in net income. Observable price changes result from, among other things, equity transactions for the same issuer executed during the reporting period, including subsequent equity offerings or other reported equity transactions related to the same issuer. For these equity transactions to be considered observable price changes of the same issuer, we evaluate whether these transactions have similar rights and obligations, including voting rights, distribution preferences, conversion rights, and other factors, to the investments we hold.

We monitor investments in privately held entities that do not report NAV per share throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, prospects and results of clinical trials, new product initiatives, new collaborative agreements, capital-raising events, and merger and acquisition activities. These investments are evaluated on the basis of a qualitative assessment for indicators of impairment by monitoring the presence of the following triggering events or impairment indicators: (i) a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee; (ii) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, (iii) a significant adverse change in the general market condition, including the research and development of technology and products that the investee is bringing or attempting to bring to the market, or (iv) significant concerns about the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern. If such indicators are present, we are required to estimate the investment’s fair value and immediately recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the investment’s carrying value in excess of its estimated fair value.

Interest rate hedge agreements

From time to time, we utilize interest rate hedge agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates. Historically, our interest rate hedge agreements primarily related to our borrowings with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. However, in connection with the LIBOR cessation projected by the end of 2021 and the potential replacement of this rate in the U.S. with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, we have paid down the majority of our outstanding borrowings of LIBOR-based debt and terminated our related interest rate hedge agreements.

We classify our interest rate hedge agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Our interest rate hedge agreements are typically considered cash flow hedges because they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge.

We formally document all relationships between interest rate hedge agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. Our interest rate hedge agreements generally meet the criteria to be deemed “highly effective” in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. We make a quantitative assessment at the inception of each interest rate hedge agreement, and qualitatively on an ongoing basis, to determine whether these instruments are “highly effective” in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The entire change in the fair value of our highly effective interest rate hedge agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. If our interest rate hedges did not qualify as “highly effective,” the changes in the fair values of the

104

derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.

The fair value of an interest rate hedge agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair values of our interest rate hedge agreements are determined using the market-standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed-cash payments and the discounted expected variable-cash receipts. The variable-cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using “significant unobservable inputs,” such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding interest rate hedge agreements.

Liability and right-of-use assets related to operating leases in which we are the lessee

We have operating lease agreements in which we are the lessee consisting of ground and office leases. At the lease commencement date (or at the acquisition date if the lease is acquired as part of a real estate acquisition), we are required to recognize a liability to account for our future obligations under these operating leases, and a corresponding right-of-use asset.

The lease liability is measured based on the present value of the future lease payments, including payments during the term under our extension options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. The present value of the future lease payments is calculated for each operating lease using each respective remaining lease term and a corresponding estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is the interest rate that we estimate we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments. Subsequently, the lease liability is accreted by applying a discount rate established at the lease commencement date to the lease liability balance as of the beginning of the period and is reduced by the payments made during the period. We classify the operating lease liability in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

 The right-of-use asset is measured based on the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for initial direct leasing costs and any other consideration exchanged with the landlord prior to the commencement of the lease, as well as adjustments to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of an acquired lease when compared with market terms at the time of acquisition. Subsequently, the right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis during the lease term. We classify the right-of-use asset in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to the “Lessee Accounting” subsection of “Lease Accounting” section within Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Monitoring of tenant credit quality

During the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality and any related material changes of our tenants by (i) monitoring the credit rating of tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments.

Non-GAAP measures and definitions

This section contains additional information of certain non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons why we use these supplemental measures of performance and believe they provide useful information to investors, as well as the definitions of other terms used in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Funds from operations and funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.’s common stockholders

GAAP-basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Nareit Board of Governors established funds from operations as an improved measurement tool. Since its introduction, funds from operations has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs. We believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that funds from operations, as adjusted, allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. On January 1, 2019, we adopted standards established by the Nareit Board of Governors in its November 2018 White Paper (the “Nareit White Paper”) on a prospective basis. The Nareit White Paper defines funds from operations as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate, plus depreciation and amortization of operating real estate assets, and after adjustments for our share of consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and real estate joint ventures. Impairments represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period.

We compute funds from operations, as adjusted, as funds from operations calculated in accordance with the Nareit White Paper, excluding significant gains, losses, and impairments realized on non-real estate investments, unrealized gains or losses on non-real estate investments, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on early termination of interest rate hedge agreements, preferred stock redemption charges, deal costs, the income tax effect related to such items, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. Neither funds from operations nor funds from operations, as adjusted, should be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as indications of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.

The following table reconciles net income to funds from operations for the share of consolidated real estate joint ventures attributable to noncontrolling interests and our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands):

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin

We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure of our operations, for financial and operational decision-making, and as a supplemental means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and impairments of real estate. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes unrealized gains or losses and significant realized gains and impairments that result from our non-real estate investments. These non-real estate investment amounts are classified in our consolidated statements of operations outside of revenues.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with relevant and useful information as it allows investors to evaluate the operating performance of our business activities without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate and non-real estate investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, capital structure, capital market transactions, and variances resulting from the volatility of market conditions outside of our control. For example, we exclude gains or losses on the early extinguishment of debt to allow investors to measure our performance independent of our indebtedness and capital structure. We believe that adjusting for the effects of impairments and gains or losses on sales of real estate, and significant impairments and significant gains on the sale of non-real estate investments allows investors to evaluate performance from period to period on a consistent basis without having to account for differences recognized because of real estate and non-real estate investment and disposition decisions. We believe that excluding charges related to stock compensation and unrealized gains or losses facilitates for investors a comparison of our business activities across periods without the volatility resulting from market forces outside of our control. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a measure of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our historical expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance, it does not represent net income or cash flows from operations calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity.

108

Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin divides Adjusted EBITDA by our revenues, as adjusted. We believe that revenues, as adjusted, provides a denominator for Adjusted EBITDA margin that is calculated on a basis more consistent with that of the Adjusted EBITDA numerator. Specifically, revenues, as adjusted, includes the same realized gains on, and impairments of, non-real estate investments that are included in the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the consistent application of results from our non-real estate investments to both the numerator and denominator of Adjusted EBITDA margin provides a more useful calculation for the comparison across periods.

The following table reconciles net income (loss) and revenues, the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA and revenues, as adjusted, respectively, for the three months and years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):

Annual rental revenue

Annual rental revenue represents the annualized fixed base rental amount, in effect as of the end of the period, related to our operating RSF. Annual rental revenue is presented using 100% of the annual rental revenue of our consolidated properties and our share of annual rental revenue for our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. Annual rental revenue per RSF is computed by dividing annual rental revenue by the sum of 100% of the RSF of our consolidated properties and our share of the RSF of properties held in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 97% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, which require tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Annual rental revenue excludes these operating expenses recovered from our tenants. Amounts recovered from our tenants related to these operating expenses, along with base rent, are classified in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations.

109

Cash interest

Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts). Refer to the definition of “Fixed-Charge Coverage Ratio” in this section under this Item 7 in this annual report on 10-K for a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to cash interest.

Class A properties and AAA locations

Class A properties are properties clustered in AAA locations that provide innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. Class A properties generally command higher annual rental rates than other classes of similar properties.

AAA locations are in close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space.

Development, redevelopment, and pre-construction

A key component of our business model is our disciplined allocation of capital to the development and redevelopment of new Class A properties, and property enhancements identified during the underwriting of certain acquired properties, located in collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters. These projects are generally focused on providing high-quality, generic, and reusable spaces that meet the real estate requirements of, and are reusable by, a wide range of tenants. Upon completion, each value-creation project is expected to generate a significant increase in rental income, net operating income, and cash flows. Our development and redevelopment projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to high-quality entities, which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value.

Development projects generally consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable facilities. Redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into office/laboratory, tech office, or agtech space. We generally will not commence new development projects for aboveground construction of new Class A office/laboratory, tech office, and agtech space without first securing significant pre-leasing for such space, except when there is solid market demand for high-quality Class A properties.

Pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction value for future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these projects will provide high-quality facilities and are expected to generate significant revenue and cash flows.

110

Fixed-charge coverage ratio

Fixed-charge coverage ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure representing the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges. We believe this ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy fixed financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and debt premiums (discounts).

The following table reconciles interest expense, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to cash interest and fixed charges for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):

----------------------------- ------------------------------- ------- ---- ------ - -------

Initial stabilized yield (unlevered)

Initial stabilized yield is calculated as the estimated amounts of net operating income at stabilization divided by our investment in the property. Our initial stabilized yield excludes the benefit of leverage. Our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are generally expected to increase over time due to contractual annual rent escalations. Our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. We expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Initial stabilized yield reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Initial stabilized yield (cash basis) reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed and our total cash investment in the property.

Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants

Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represent tenants that are investment-grade rated or publicly traded companies with an average daily market capitalization greater than $10 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, as reported by Bloomberg Professional Services. In addition, we monitor the credit quality and related material changes of our tenants. Material changes that cause a tenant’s market capitalization to decline below $10 billion, which are not immediately reflected in the twelve‑month average, may result in their exclusion from this measure.

Joint venture financial information

We present components of balance sheet and operating results information related to our joint ventures, which are not presented, or intended to be presented, in accordance with GAAP. We present the proportionate share of certain financial line items as follows: (i) for each real estate joint venture that we consolidate in our financial statements, which are controlled by us through contractual rights or majority voting rights, but of which we own less than 100%, we apply the noncontrolling interest economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at the amount of such cumulative noncontrolling interest share of each component presented; and (ii) for each real estate joint venture that we do not control and do not consolidate, and are instead controlled jointly or by our joint venture partners through contractual rights or majority voting rights, we apply our economic ownership percentage to each financial item to arrive at our proportionate share of each component presented.

The components of balance sheet and operating results information related to joint ventures do not represent our legal claim to those items. For each entity that we do not wholly own, the joint venture agreement generally determines what equity holders can receive upon capital events, such as sales or refinancing, or in the event of a liquidation. Equity holders are normally entitled to their respective legal ownership of any residual cash from a joint venture only after all liabilities, priority distributions, and claims have been repaid or satisfied.

We believe this information can help investors estimate the balance sheet and operating results information related to our partially owned entities. Presenting this information provides a perspective not immediately available from consolidated financial statements and one that can supplement an understanding of the joint venture assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in our consolidated results.

The components of balance sheet and operating results information related to joint ventures are limited as an analytical tool as the overall economic ownership interest does not represent our legal claim to each of our joint ventures’ assets, liabilities, or results of operations. In addition, joint venture financial information may include financial information related to the unconsolidated real estate joint ventures that we do not control. Refer to Note 4 – “Consolidated and Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information on our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results and our total assets and liabilities, joint venture financial information should be examined in conjunction with our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets. Joint venture financial information should not be considered an alternative to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP.

112

Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends

Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends includes the deduction for distributions to noncontrolling interests. For purposes of this calculation, changes in operating assets and liabilities are excluded as they represent timing differences.

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA and net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA

Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA and net debt and preferred stock to Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as supplemental measures in evaluating our balance sheet leverage. Net debt is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Net debt and preferred stock is equal to the sum of net debt, as discussed above, plus preferred stock outstanding as of the end of the period. Refer to the definition of “Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin” in this section under this Item 7 for further information on the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

The following table reconciles debt to net debt, and to net debt and preferred stock, and computes the ratio of each to Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):

Operating margin 71% 71% 71%

Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, excluding equity in the earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairments of real estate, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, and investment income or loss. We believe net operating income provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe net operating income is a useful measure for investors to evaluate the operating performance of our consolidated real estate assets. Net operating income on a cash basis is net operating income adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and amortization of acquired above- and below-market lease revenue adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that net operating income on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent revenue and the amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases.

Furthermore, we believe net operating income is useful to investors as a performance measure for our consolidated properties because, when compared across periods, net operating income reflects trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, which provide a perspective not immediately apparent from net income or loss. Net operating income can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating net operating income generated by a property divided by our investment in the property. Net operating income excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort comparability of operating performance at the property level. Impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving net operating income because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. Impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions or a deterioration in market conditions. We also exclude realized and unrealized investment income or loss, which results from investment decisions that occur at the corporate level related to non-real estate investments in publicly traded companies and certain privately held entities. Therefore, we do not consider these activities to be an indication of operating performance of our real estate assets at the property level. Our calculation of net operating income also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to corporate strategy. Property operating expenses included in determining net operating income primarily consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs, and

114

maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. We calculate operating margin as net operating income divided by total revenues.

We believe that in order to facilitate for investors a clear understanding of our operating results, net operating income should be examined in conjunction with net income or loss as presented in our consolidated statements of operations. Net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to make distributions.

Operating statistics

We present certain operating statistics related to our properties, including number of properties, RSF, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations as of the end of the period. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they facilitate an understanding of certain trends for our properties. We compute the number of properties, RSF, occupancy percentage, leasing activity, and contractual lease expirations at 100% for all properties in which we have an investment, including properties owned by our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. For operating metrics based on annual rental revenue, refer to the definition of “Annual Rental Revenue” in this “Non-GAAP Measures and Definitions” section.

Same property comparisons

As a result of changes within our total property portfolio during the comparative periods presented, including changes from assets acquired or sold, properties placed into development or redevelopment, and development or redevelopment properties recently placed into service, the consolidated total income from rentals, as well as rental operating expenses in our operating results, can show significant changes from period to period. In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations over a given quarterly or annual period, we analyze the operating performance for all consolidated properties that were fully operating for the entirety of the comparative periods presented, referred to as same properties. We separately present quarterly and year-to-date same property results to align with the interim financial information required by the SEC in our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. These same properties are analyzed separately from properties acquired subsequent to the first day in the earliest comparable quarterly or year-to-date period presented, properties that underwent development or redevelopment at any time during the comparative periods, unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, properties classified as held for sale, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from same property results. Additionally, lease termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of same properties. Refer to “Same Properties” in the “Results of Operations” under this Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Stabilized occupancy date

The stabilized occupancy date represents the estimated date on which the project is expected to reach occupancy of 95% or greater.

Tenant recoveries

Tenant recoveries represent revenues comprising reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses and earned in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred and the tenant’s obligation to reimburse us arises.

On January 1, 2019, we adopted a new lease accounting standard, among other practical expedients and policies, and elected the single component accounting policy. As a result of our election of the single component accounting policy, we account for rental revenues and tenant recoveries generated through the leasing of real estate assets that qualify for this policy as a single component and classify associated revenue in income from rentals in our consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, we presented rental revenues and tenant recoveries separately in our consolidated statements of operations. Refer to the “Lease Accounting” section in Note 2 – “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information. We continue to provide investors with a separate presentation of rental revenues and tenant recoveries in the “Comparison of Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2019, to the Year Ended December 31, 2018” subsections of the “Results of Operations” section under this Item 7 because we believe it promotes investors’ understanding of the changes in our operating results. We believe that the presentation of tenant recoveries is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to recover operating expenses under our triple net leases, including recoveries of utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes, common area expenses, and other operating expenses, and of our ability to mitigate the effect to net income for any significant variability to components of our operating expenses.

115

The following table reconciles income from rentals to tenant recoveries for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in thousands):

------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- ---------- ---- --------- -------- - - ---------

 Year Ended December 31,
 2019 2018 2017
Income from rentals $ 1,516,864 $ 1,314,781 $ 1,122,325
Rental revenues (1,165,788 ) (1,010,718 ) (863,181 )
Tenant recoveries $ 351,076 $ 304,063 $ 259,144

Total market capitalization

Total market capitalization is equal to the outstanding shares of common stock at the end of the period multiplied by the closing price on the last trading day of the period (i.e., total equity capitalization), plus total debt outstanding at period-end.

Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income

Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets as it reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. Unencumbered net operating income is derived from assets classified in continuing operations, which are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest, as of the period for which income is presented.

The following table summarizes unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands):

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------- --------- ---- ------- - -------

 Year Ended December 31,

Unencumbered net operating income as a percentage of total net operating income 94% 88%

Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding – diluted

From time to time, we enter into capital market transactions, including forward equity sales agreements, to fund acquisitions, to fund construction of our highly leased development and redevelopment projects, and for general working capital purposes. We are required to consider the potential dilutive effect of our forward equity sales agreements under the treasury stock method while the forward equity sales agreements are outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, we had no forward equity sales agreements outstanding. Prior to the conversion of our remaining outstanding shares in October 2019, we considered the effect of assumed conversion of our outstanding Series D Convertible Preferred Stock when determining potentially dilutive incremental shares to our common stock. When calculating the assumed conversion, we add back to net income or loss the dividends paid on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock to the numerator and then include additional common shares assumed to have been issued (as displayed in the table below) to the denominator of the per share calculation. The effect of the assumed conversion is considered separately for our per share calculations of net income or loss; funds from operations, computed in accordance with the definition in the Nareit White Paper; and funds from operations, as adjusted. Prior to the conversion of our remaining outstanding shares in October 2019, our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock was dilutive and assumed to be converted when quarterly and annual basic EPS, funds from operations, or funds from operations, as adjusted, exceeded approximately $1.75 and $7.00 per share, respectively, subject to conversion ratio adjustments and the impact of repurchases of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. The effect of the assumed conversion was included when it was dilutive on a per share basis. The dilutive effect of less than a half cent per share appears as zero in our reconciliation of EPS – diluted to funds from operations per share – diluted, and funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, even when the dilutive effect to the numerator alone appears in our reconciliation. Refer to Note 13 – “Earnings per Share” and Note 16 – “Stockholders’ Equity” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information related to our forward equity sales agreements and our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock.

The weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding used in calculating EPS – diluted, funds from operations per share – diluted, and funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, are calculated as follows (in thousands):

[Refer to Note 3]:
NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed.

(5) As discussed above, we completed the acquisitions of BakerCorp and BlueLine in July 2018 and October 2018, respectively. Estimated market share as of December 31, 2018 includes the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of BakerCorp and BlueLine. Strategy For the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency. In 2020, we expect to continue our disciplined focus on increasing our profitability and return on invested capital. In particular, our strategy calls for: - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * A consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; - ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * The further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix, with a dual objective: to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base, and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth. We believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts, primarily large construction and industrial customers, as well as select l...

(4) Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes, excluding transaction and integration expenses and special charges, or $840.0 million, $780.1 million, and $694.1 million for the years ended November 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 32 ------------------------------------- -------------- ---------------------------------------------- Estimate for the year ending November 30, 2020 Earnings per share - diluted $5.15 to $5.25 Impact of special charges 0.05 Adjusted earnings per share - diluted $5.20 to $5.30 Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchan...
