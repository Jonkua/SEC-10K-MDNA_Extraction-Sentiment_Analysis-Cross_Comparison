Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Executive Overview

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Perrigo Company plc was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on June 28, 2013 and became the successor registrant of Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation, on December 18, 2013 in connection with the acquisition of Elan Corporation, plc ("Elan"). Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Perrigo," the "Company," "we," "our," "us," and similar pronouns used herein refer to Perrigo Company plc, its subsidiaries, and all predecessors of Perrigo Company plc and its subsidiaries.

We are dedicated to making lives better by bringing “Quality, Affordable Self-Care Products™” that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. We are a leading provider of over-the-counter ("OTC") health and wellness solutions that enhance individual well-being by empowering consumers to proactively prevent or treat conditions that can be self-managed. We are also a leading producer of generic prescription pharmaceutical topical products such as creams, lotions, gels, and nasal sprays.

Our vision is designed to support our shifting focus to our consumer branded and store brand portfolio and our global reach and the opportunities for growth we see ahead of us, while remaining loyal to our heritage. Our vision represents an evolution from healthcare to self-care, which takes advantage of a massive global trend and opens up a large number of adjacent growth opportunities. We define self-care as not just treating disease or helping individuals feel better after taking a product, but also maintaining and enhancing their overall health and wellness. In 2019, Perrigo’s management and Board of Directors launched a three-year strategy to transform the Company into a consumer self-care leader, consistent with our vision. Significant progress was made in the first year of our transformation journey towards achieving the major components of management’s transformation strategy, which consists of: reconfiguring the portfolio, delivering on base plans, creating repeatable platforms for growth, driving organizational effectiveness and capabilities, increasing productivity, allocating capital and delivering consistent and sustainable results in line with consumer-packaged goods peers.

Our fiscal year begins on January 1 and ends on December 31 of each year. We end our quarterly accounting periods on the Saturday closest to the end of the calendar quarter, with the fourth quarter ending on December 31 of each year.

Our Segments

During the three months ended March 30, 2019, we changed the composition of our operating and reporting segments. We moved our pharmaceuticals and diagnostic businesses in Israel from the Consumer Self-Care International segment to the Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment and we made certain adjustments to our allocations between segments. These changes were made to reflect changes in the way in which management makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the Company.

Our new reporting and operating segments are as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Consumer Self-Care Americas ("CSCA"), formerly Consumer Healthcare Americas, comprises our consumer self-care business (OTC, contract manufacturing, infant formula, and oral self-care categories and our divested animal health category) in the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Consumer Self-Care International ("CSCI"), formerly Consumer Healthcare International, comprises our branded consumer self-care business primarily in Europe and Australia, our consumer-focused business in the United Kingdom and parts of Asia, and our liquid licensed products business in the United Kingdom.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Prescription Pharmaceuticals ("RX") comprises our prescription pharmaceuticals business in the U.S. and our pharmaceuticals and diagnostic businesses in Israel, which were previously in our CSCI segment.

Our segments reflect the way in which our management makes operating decisions, allocates resources and manages the growth and profitability of the Company.

For information on each segment, our business environment, and competitive landscape, refer to Item 1. Business. For results by segment and geographic locations see below "Segment Results" and Item 8. Note 2 and Note 20.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Executive Overview

Strategy

Our strategy is to make lives better by bringing "Quality, Affordable Self-Care Products™" that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. We accomplish this by leveraging our global infrastructure to expand our product offerings, thereby providing new innovative products and product line extensions to existing consumers and servicing new consumers through entry into adjacent product categories or new geographies. We accomplish this strategy by investing in and continually improving all aspects of our five strategic pillars:

- -------------
• High quality;

- --------------------------
• Superior customer service;

- -------------------
• Leading innovation;

- --------------
• Best cost; and

- -----------------
• Empowered people,

while remaining true to our three core values, Integrity - we do what is right; Respect - we demonstrate the value we hold for one another; and Responsibility - we hold ourselves accountable for our actions.

We utilize shared services and Research and Development ("R&D") centers of excellence in order to help ensure consistency in our processes around the world, and to maintain focus on our five strategic pillars.

We continually reinvest in our R&D pipeline and work with partners as necessary to strive to be first-to-market with new products. Our organic growth has been driven by successful new product launches in all our segments and expansion in new channels like e-commerce. Over time, we expect to continue to grow inorganically through expansion into adjacent products, product categories, and channels, as well as potentially through entry into new geographic markets. We evaluate potential acquisition targets using an internally developed 12-point scale, that is weighted towards accretive growth and correlated with shareholder value.

Competitive Advantage

Our consumer-facing business model combines the unique competencies of a fast-moving consumer goods company and a pharmaceutical manufacturing company with the supply chain breadth necessary to support customers in the markets we serve. These durable business model competencies align with our five strategic pillars and provide us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We fully integrate quality in our operational systems across all products. Our ability to manage our supply chain complexity across multiple dosage forms, formulations, and stock-keeping units, as well as acquisitions, integrations, and hundreds of global partners provides value to our customers. Product development capacity and life cycle management are at the core of our operational investments. Globally we have 22 manufacturing plants that are all in good regulatory compliance standing and have systems and structures in place to guide our continued success. Our leadership team is fully engaged in aligning all our metrics and objectives around sustainable compliance with industry associations and regulatory agencies.

Among other things, we believe the following give us a competitive advantage and provide value to our customers:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Leadership in first-to-market product development and product life cycle management;

- -------------------------------------------------
• Turn-key regulatory and promotional capabilities;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------
• Management of supply chain complexity and utilizing economies of scale;

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Quality and cost effectiveness throughout the supply chain creating a sustainable, low-cost network;

- -------------------------------------------------------------
• Deep understanding of consumer needs and customer strategies;

- ----------------------------------------
• Industry leading e-commerce support; and

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Expansive pan-European commercial infrastructure, brand-building capabilities, and a diverse product portfolio.

Executive Overview

Product Categories

As we continue to transform to a consumer-focused, self-care company, we re-aligned our product categories in our CSCA and CSCI segments as of December 31, 2019. The re-alignment standardizes our categories and product level detail to provide consistency across segments. This transformative step will optimize the way in which management reports and evaluates our business (refer to Item 1. Business - Our Segments and Item 8. Note 2).

• We previously announced a plan to separate our RX business, which, when completed, will enable us to focus on expanding our consumer-focused businesses. In 2019, we continued preparations related to our planned separation, which may include a possible sale, spin-off, merger or other form of separation. While we remain committed to transforming to a consumer-focused business, we have not committed to a specific date or form for the separation. In connection with the proposed separation, we have incurred significant preparation costs and will continue to incur costs that when completed will be in the range of $45.0 million to $80.0 million, excluding restructuring expenses and transaction costs, depending on the final timing and structure of the transaction.

Recent Developments

Internal Revenue Service Notices of Proposed Adjustments

On August 22, 2019, we received a draft Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") from the IRS with respect to our fiscal tax years ended June 28, 2014 and June 27, 2015, relating to the deductibility of interest on $7.5 billion in

 57

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Consolidated

debts owed to Perrigo Company plc by Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Perrigo Company, plc. The debts were incurred in connection with the Elan merger transaction in 2013. The draft NOPA would cap the interest rate on the debts for U.S. federal tax purposes at 130.0% of the Applicable Federal Rate (a blended rate reduction of 4.0% per annum from the rates agreed to by the parties), on the stated ground that the loans were not negotiated on an arms’-length basis. As a result of the proposed interest rate reduction, the draft NOPA proposes a reduction in gross interest expense of approximately $480.0 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. If the IRS were to prevail in its proposed adjustment, we estimate an increase in tax expense for such fiscal years of approximately $170.0 million, excluding interest and penalties. In addition, we would expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for the period from June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2019. If those further adjustments were sustained, based on our preliminary calculations and subject to further analysis, our current best estimate is that the additional tax expense would not exceed $200.0 million, excluding interest and penalties, for the period June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2019. We do not expect any similar adjustments beyond December 31, 2019 as proposed regulations, issued under section 267A of the Internal Revenue Code, would eliminate the deductibility of interest on this debt. We strongly disagree with the IRS position and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies. No payment of any amount related to the proposed adjustments is required to be made, if at all, until all applicable proceedings have been completed.

Following receipt of the draft NOPA, Perrigo provided the IRS with a detailed written response on September 20, 2019. That submission included an analysis by external advisors that supported the original interest rates as being consistent with arms'-length rates for comparable debt and explained why the exam team's analyses and conclusions were both factually and legally misguided. Based on discussions with the IRS, we had believed that the IRS staff would take our submission into account and meet with us to discuss whether this issue could be resolved at the examination level. However, in the weeks following such discussions, IRS staff advised that they would not respond in detail to our September submission or negotiate the interest rate issue prior to issuing a final NOPA consistent with the draft NOPA. Accordingly, we currently expect that we will receive a final NOPA regarding this matter that proposes substantially the same adjustments described in the draft NOPA. While we believe our position to be correct, there can be no assurance of an ultimate favorable outcome, and if the matter is resolved unfavorably it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and capital resources (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Tax Related Risks and Item 8. Note 15).

On April 26, 2019, we received a revised NOPA from the IRS regarding transfer pricing positions related to the IRS audit of Athena for the years ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. The NOPA carries forward the IRS's theory from its 2017 draft NOPA that when Elan took over the future funding of Athena’s in-process research and development after acquiring Athena in 1996, Elan should have paid a substantially higher royalty rate for the right to exploit Athena’s intellectual property, rather than rates based on transfer pricing documentation prepared by Elan's external tax advisors. The NOPA proposes a payment of $843.0 million, which represents additional tax and a 40.0% penalty. This amount excludes consideration of offsetting tax attributes and potentially material interest. We strongly disagree with the IRS position and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies, including potentially those available under the U.S. - Ireland Income Tax Treaty to alleviate double taxation. No payment of the additional amounts is required until the matter is resolved administratively, judicially, or through treaty negotiation. While we believe our position to be correct, there can be no assurance of an ultimate favorable outcome, and if the matter is resolved unfavorably it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and capital resources (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Tax Related Risks and Item 8. Note 15).

Irish Tax Appeals Commission Notice of Amended Assessment

On October 30, 2018, we received an audit finding letter from the Irish Office of the Revenue Commissioners (“Irish Revenue”) for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. The audit finding letter relates to the tax treatment of the 2013 sale of the Tysabri® intellectual property and other assets related to Tysabri® to Biogen Idec from Elan Pharma. The consideration paid by Biogen to Elan Pharma took the form of an upfront payment and future contingent royalty payments. Irish Revenue issued a Notice of Amended Assessment ("NoA") on November 29, 2018, which assesses an Irish corporation tax liability against Elan Pharma in the amount of €1,636 million, not including interest or any applicable penalties.

We disagree with this assessment and believe that the NoA is without merit and incorrect as a matter of law. We filed an appeal of the NoA on December 27, 2018 and will pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues as may be necessary or appropriate. In connection with that, Elan Pharma was granted leave by the Irish High Court on February 25, 2019 to seek judicial review of the issuance of the NoA by Irish Revenue. The judicial review filing is based

 58

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Consolidated

on our belief that Elan Pharma's legitimate expectations as a taxpayer have been breached, not on the merits of the NoA itself. The High Court has scheduled a hearing in this judicial review proceeding in April 2020, and we would expect a decision in this matter in the second half of 2020. If we are ultimately successful in the judicial review proceedings, the NoA will be invalidated and Irish Revenue will not be able to re-issue the NoA. The proceedings before the Tax Appeals Commission have been stayed until a decision on the judicial review application has been made. If for any reason the judicial review proceedings are ultimately unsuccessful in establishing that Irish Revenue's issuance of the NoA breaches our legitimate expectations, Elan Pharma will reactivate its appeal to challenge the merits of the NoA before the Tax Appeals Commission. While we believe our position to be correct, there can be no assurance of an ultimate favorable outcome, and if the matter is resolved unfavorably it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and capital resources (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Tax Related Risks and Item 8. Note 15).

• During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we identified impairment indicators related to certain pain relief products that we licensed from a third party and reported as a definite-lived intangible asset. The impairment indicators related to commercial launch delays and a decision by the licensor to not extend the license agreement upon expiration. We determined the asset was fully impaired and recorded an asset impairment of $9.7 million.

• During the three months ended September 28, 2019, after regulatory bodies announced worldwide that Ranitidine may potentially contain NDMA, a known environmental contaminant, we promptly began testing our externally sourced Ranitidine API and Ranitidine-based products. On October 8, 2019, we halted shipments of the product based upon preliminary results. Based on the totality of data gathered, we made the decision to conduct a voluntary retail market withdrawal, which resulted in a decrease in net sales of $1.8 million and a decrease in gross profit of $2.9 million in our CSCI segment.

Recent Trends and Developments

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Although pricing pressure is showing some signs of moderation, during 2019 we continued to experience a significant year-over-year reduction in pricing in our RX segment due to competitive pressure. We expect softness in pricing to continue to impact the segment for the foreseeable future.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On February 24, 2020, along with our partner Catalent Pharma Solutions, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on our abbreviated new drug application for generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, the first AB-rated generic version of ProAir® HFA. Shortly after approval, we launched with limited commercial quantities and anticipate that we will be in a position to provide a steady supply of this product by the fourth quarter of 2020.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we tested our RX U.S. reporting unit for impairment. The impairment indicators related to a combination of industry and market factors that led to reduced projections of future cash flows. We determined the reporting unit was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $109.2 million.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we identified impairment indicators on a definite-lived intangible asset related to our clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide topical gel (generic equivalent to Benzaclin®). Increased competition caused price erosion that lowered our long-range revenue forecast, which indicated the asset was no longer recoverable and was partially impaired. We recorded an asset impairment of $21.2 million.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On July 2, 2019, we purchased the Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") for a generic gel product for $49.0 million in cash, which we capitalized as a developed product technology intangible asset. We launched the product during the third quarter of 2019.

• During the three months ended September 28, 2019, we identified impairment indicators related to our Evamist® branded product, which is a definite-lived intangible asset. The indicators related to a decline in sales volume and a corresponding reduction in our long-range revenue forecast. We recorded an asset impairment of $10.8 million.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On May 17, 2019, we purchased the ANDA for a generic product used to relieve pain for $15.7 million in cash, which we capitalized as a developed product technology intangible asset. We launched the product during the third quarter of 2019.

OTHER

We previously had two legacy segments, Specialty Sciences and Other, which contained our Tysabri® financial asset and API businesses, respectively, which we divested. Following these divestitures, there were no substantial assets or operations left in either of these segments. Effective January 1, 2017, all expenses associated with our former Specialty Sciences segment were moved to unallocated expenses.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the divestment of the Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for $2.2 billion upfront in cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments if the royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma meet specific thresholds in 2018 and 2020, respectively. As a result of this transaction, we transferred the entire financial asset to Royalty Pharma and recorded a $17.1 million gain in Change in financial assets. See "Interest, Other (Income) Expense and Change in Financial Assets (Consolidated)" below.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our India API business to Strides Shasun Limited. We received $22.2 million in proceeds, resulting in an immaterial gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to closing the sale, we determined that the carrying value of the India API business exceeded its fair value less the cost to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $35.3 million, which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our Israel API business to SK Capital for a sale price of $110.0 million, which resulted in an immaterial gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Other

The $72.2 million increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was due primarily to a $31.0 million increase in legal and consulting fees partially due to the absence of a $17.8 million insurance recovery received in the prior year, a $15.6 million increase in acquisition and integration-related charges related to the Ranir acquisition, a $13.8 million increase in employee compensation expenses, and a $10.7 million increase due primarily to our strategic transformation initiative and the reorganization of our executive management team.

The $24.7 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was due primarily to an insurance recovery of $17.8 million, a decrease in legal and consulting fees of $8.7 million and, a decrease in restructuring expense of $5.5 million related to strategic organizational enhancements; partially offset by an increase in employee-related expenses of $5.2 million.

Change in Financial Assets

The proceeds from our 2017 sale of the Tysabri® financial asset consisted of $2.2 billion in upfront cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in contingent milestone payments related to 2018 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019 we received the $250.0 million contingent milestone payment.

 During the year ended December 31, 2019 the fair value of the Royalty Pharma milestone payment related to 2020 increased by $22.1 million to $95.3 million. These adjustments were driven by higher projected global net sales of Tysabri® and the estimated probability of achieving the earn-out.

In order for us to receive the milestone payment related to 2020 of $400.0 million, Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri® sales in 2020 must exceed $351.0 million. The Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri® were $337.5 million in 2018. If Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri® sales do not meet the prescribed threshold in 2020, we will write-off the $95.3 million asset and record a loss. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will increase the asset to $400.0 million and recognize income of $304.7 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (refer to Item 8. Note 7).

During the year ended December 31, 2018, royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® received by Royalty Pharma met the 2018 threshold resulting in an increase to the asset and a gain of $170.1 million recognized in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Also during that period, the fair value of the remaining Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payment related to 2020 increased $18.6 million due to higher projected global net sales of Tysabri® and the estimated probability of achieving the contingent milestone payment related to 2020.

Interest Expense, Net

The $6.3 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was due primarily to changes in our underlying hedge exposure and interest income (refer to Item 8. Note 9).

The $40.1 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was the result of early debt repayments made during the year ended December 31, 2017.

 67

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Unallocated, Interest, Other, and Taxes

Other (Income) Expense, Net

The $72.1 million change was due primarily to a $71.7 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our animal health business (refer to Item 8. Note 3)

The $16.2 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was due primarily to the absence of $10.0 million in milestone income related to royalty rights, a $9.5 million loss on our fair value investment securities, and $4.5 million of unfavorable changes in revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies; partially offset by the absence of a $5.9 million loss on hedges related to the extinguishment of debt in the prior year, and a $2.7 million gain on our equity method investments.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $135.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which consisted of tender premium on debt repayments, transaction costs, write-off of deferred financing fees, and bond discounts.

Income Taxes (Consolidated)

The effective tax rates were as follows:

----------------- - ----------------- ---- ----------------- ---- -

Year Ended
December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017
 14.6 % 54.9 % 57.3 %

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased in comparison to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the U.S. valuation allowance offset by increased U.S. permanent adjustments largely due to disallowed interest expense.

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased in comparison to the prior year due primarily to the 2017 sale of API Israel and the one-time U.S. transition toll tax, offset by additional tax expense due to valuation allowances in Belgium and state tax recorded for the future distributions of foreign earnings recorded in 2018.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We finance our operations with internally generated funds, supplemented by credit arrangements with third parties and capital market financing. We routinely monitor current and expected operational requirements and financial market conditions to evaluate other available financing sources including revolving bank credit and securities offerings. In determining our future capital requirements, we regularly consider, among other factors, known trends and uncertainties, such as the Notice of Assessment ("NoA") and the draft and final Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPAs") and other contingencies. We note that no payment of the additional amounts assessed by Irish Revenue pursuant to the NoA or proposed by the IRS in the NOPAs is currently required, and no such payment is expected to be required, unless and until a final determination of the matter is reached that is adverse to us, which could take several years in either case (refer to Item 8. Note 15 for additional information on the NoA and NOPAs). Based on the foregoing, management believes that our operations and borrowing resources are sufficient to provide for our short-term and long-term capital requirements, as described below. However, an adverse result with respect to our appeal of any material outstanding tax assessments or litigation, including securities or drug pricing matters, could ultimately require the use of corporate assets to pay such assessments, damages resulting from third-party claims, and related interest and/or penalties, and any such use of corporate assets would limit the assets available for other corporate purposes. As such, we continue to evaluate the impact of the above factors on liquidity and may determine that modifications to our capital structure are appropriate if market conditions deteriorate, favorable capital market opportunities become available, or any change in conditions relating to the NoA, the NOPAs or other contingencies have a material impact on our capital requirements.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash and Cash Equivalents

*    Working capital represents current assets less current liabilities, excluding cash and cash equivalents and current indebtedness.

Cash, cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings available under our credit facilities are expected to be sufficient to finance our liquidity and capital expenditures in both the short and long term. Although our lenders have made commitments to make funds available to us in a timely fashion under our revolving credit agreements and overdraft facilities, if economic conditions worsen or new information becomes publicly available impacting the institutions’ credit rating or capital ratios, these lenders may be unable or unwilling to lend money pursuant to our existing credit facilities. Should our outlook on liquidity requirements change substantially from current projections, we may seek additional sources of liquidity in the future.

Cash Generated by (Used in) Investing Activities

Year Ended December 31, 2019 vs. December 31, 2018

The $469.3 million decrease in investing cash flow was due primarily to:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $747.7 million decrease in cash used for the acquisition of Ranir (refer to Item 8. Note 3);

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $113.5 million decrease in cash used for other acquisitions, primarily for the branded OTC rights to Prevacid®24HR for $61.7 million, an ANDA for a generic gel product for $49.0 million, an ANDA for a generic product used to relieve pain for $15.7 million, and Budesonide Nasal Spray and Triamcinolone Nasal Spray for $14.0 million, partially offset by the absence of $35.6 million of prior year acquisitions primarily related to an ANDA for a generic topical cream (refer to Item 8. Note 3); and

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $35.1 million decrease in cash used for capital spending, primarily to increase tablet and infant formula capacity and quality/regulation projects; partially offset by

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $177.3 million in proceeds received from divestitures, primarily from our animal health business (refer to Item 8. Note 3).

Capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be between $175.0 million and $225.0 million related to manufacturing productivity and efficiency initiatives, increased tablet and infant formula capacity and quality/regulatory projects. We expect to fund these estimated capital expenditures with funds from operating cash flows.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 vs. December 31, 2017

The $2.5 billion decrease in investing cash flow was due primarily to:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $2.2 billion absence of proceeds from the 2017 divestment of our Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $149.4 million absence of 2017 net proceeds from sale of business and other assets;

- -----------------------------------------------------------
• $73.6 million decrease in proceeds from royalty rights; and

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $35.6 million decrease in cash due primarily to the acquisition of an ANDA for a generic topical cream.

Cash used for capital expenditures totaled $102.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $88.6 million in the prior year. The increase in cash used for capital expenditures was due primarily to the increase in the number of manufacturing projects in the current year compared to the prior year.

Borrowings and Capital Resources

Overdraft Facilities

We have overdraft facilities available that we use to support our cash management operations. We report any balances outstanding in "Other Financing" in Item 8. Note 11. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facilities as of December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.

Leases

We had $158.2 million of lease liabilities and $157.5 million of lease assets as of December 31, 2019.

Accounts Receivable Factoring

We have accounts receivable factoring arrangements with non-related third-party financial institutions (the “Factors”). Pursuant to the terms of the arrangements, we sell to the Factors certain of our accounts receivable balances on a non-recourse basis for credit approved accounts. An administrative fee per invoice is charged on the gross amount of accounts receivables assigned to the Factors, and interest is calculated at the applicable EUR LIBOR rate plus a spread. The total amount factored on a non-recourse basis and excluded from accounts receivable was $10.0 million and $24.3 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

Revolving Credit Agreements

On March 8, 2018, we terminated the revolving credit agreement entered into in December 2014 and entered into a $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement maturing on March 8, 2023 (the "2018 Revolver"). There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2018 Revolver as of December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.

Debt Repayments

 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we made $24.7 million in scheduled principal payments. In connection with the Omega acquisition, on March 30, 2015, we assumed a 5.000% retail bond due 2019 in the amount of €120.0 million ($130.7 million). On May 23, 2019 we repaid the bond in full. On August 15, 2019, we refinanced the €284.4 million ($317.1 million) outstanding under the 2018 Term Loan with the proceeds of a new $600.0 million term loan (the "2019 Term Loan"), maturing on August 15, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made $51.5 million in scheduled principal payments.

We are in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of December 31, 2019 (refer to Item 8. Note 11 and Note 10 for more information on all of the above debt facilities and lease activity, respectively).

Credit Ratings

Our credit ratings on December 31, 2019 were Baa3 (stable) and BBB- (stable) by Moody's Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings, respectively.

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above. Factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in operating performance, the economic environment, our financial position, and changes in business strategy. If changes in our credit ratings were to occur, they could impact, among other things, future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, and vendor financing terms.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, net sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into R&D arrangements with third parties that often require milestone payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the product. Because of the contingent nature of these payments, they are not included in our table of contractual obligations below.

Contractual Obligations

Our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of December 31, 2019 are set forth in the following table. Some of the amounts included in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including the duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the enforceable and legally binding obligations actually paid in future periods may vary from the amounts reflected in the table (in millions):

(4) Includes amounts associated with non-qualified plans related to deferred compensation, executive retention and post employment benefits. Of this amount, we have funded $34.4 million, which is recorded in Other non-current assets on the balance sheet. These amounts are assumed payable after five years, although certain circumstances, such as termination, would require earlier payment.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Primarily includes consulting fees, legal settlements, contingent consideration obligations, restructuring accruals, insurance obligations, and electrical and gas purchase contracts, which were accrued in Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2019 for all years.

We fund our U.S. qualified profit-sharing and investment plan in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and Internal Revenue Service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction. We are committed to making the required minimum contributions, which we expect to be approximately $24.8 million over the next 12 months. Future contributions are dependent upon various factors, including employees’ eligible compensation, plan participation and changes, if any, to current funding requirements. Therefore, no amounts were included in the Contractual Obligations table above. We generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities.

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $448.6 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. These unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above due to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of settlement with taxing authorities.

Net deferred income tax liabilities were $275.2 million as of December 31, 2019. This amount is not included in the Contractual Obligations table above because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Net deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in

any future periods. As a result, scheduling net deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The determination of certain amounts in our financial statements requires the use of estimates. These estimates are based upon our historical experiences combined with management’s understanding of current facts and circumstances. Although the estimates are considered reasonable based on the currently available information, actual results could differ from the estimates we have used. Management considers the below accounting estimates to require the most judgment and to be the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates are reviewed by the Audit Committee.

Revenue Recognition

Net product sales include estimates of variable consideration for which accruals and allowances are established. Variable consideration for product sales consists primarily of chargebacks, rebates, other incentive programs, and related administrative fees recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accrued customer programs, and sales returns and shelf stock allowances recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a reduction to Accounts receivable. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes in which relevant factors, such as historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns, are either probability-weighted to derive an estimate of expected value or the estimate reflects the single most likely outcome. Overall, these reserves reflect the best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from the estimates, these estimates are adjusted, which would affect revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.

The aggregate gross-to-net adjustments related to RX products can exceed 50% of the segment's gross sales. In contrast, the aggregate gross-to-net adjustments related to CSCA and CSCI typically do not exceed 10% of the segment's gross sales.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Chargebacks

We market and sell U.S. Rx pharmaceutical products directly to wholesalers, distributors, warehousing pharmacy chains, and other direct purchasing groups. We also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies, non-warehousing chains, managed care organizations, and group purchasing organizations, (collectively referred to as "indirect customers"). In addition, we enter into agreements with some indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products. These indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, we may pre-authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers. Under either arrangement, we provide chargeback credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler's invoice price. The accrual for chargebacks includes an estimate for outstanding claims that occurred but for which the related claim has not yet been paid, and an estimate for future claims that will be made when the wholesaler inventory is sold to the indirect customer. This estimate is based on historical chargeback experience, which includes sell-through levels by wholesalers to retailers, and confirmed wholesaler inventory levels. We regularly assess current pricing dynamics and wholesaler inventory levels to ensure the liability for future chargebacks is fairly stated.

Medicaid Rebates

We participate in certain qualifying U.S. federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating government entities. Medicaid rebates are amounts owed based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector (Medicaid) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. Medicaid reserves are based on expected payments, which are driven by patient usage, contract performance, and field inventory that will be subject to a Medicaid rebate. Medicaid rebates are typically billed up to 180 days after the product is shipped, but can be billed as many as 270 days after the quarter in which the product is dispensed to the Medicaid participant. As a result, our Medicaid rebate provision includes an estimate of outstanding claims for end-customer sales that occurred but for which the related claim has not been billed, and an estimate for future claims that will be made when inventory in the distribution channel is sold through to plan participants. Our calculation also requires other estimates, such as estimates of sales mix, to determine which sales are subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. Our rebates are reviewed on a monthly basis against actual claims data to ensure the liability is fairly stated.

Returns and Shelf Stock Allowances

We maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Generally, product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. The majority of our product returns are the result of product dating, which falls within the range set by our policy, and are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer. Our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns, which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which our customers may return product. The period is based on the shelf life of the products at the time of shipment. Additionally, when establishing our reserves, we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch, entrance into the market of additional competition, and changes in formulations.

Shelf stock allowances are credits issued to reflect changes in the selling price of a product and are based upon estimates of the amount of product remaining in a customer's inventory at the time of the anticipated price change. In many cases, the customer is contractually entitled to such a credit. The allowances for shelf stock adjustments are based on specified terms with certain customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, and estimated changes in market price.

 76

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

RX Administrative Fees and Other Rebates

Rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations, and end-user customers. Settlement of rebates and fees generally may occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We provide a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Estimates used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes, and average contract pricing.

CSCA and CSCI Rebates and Other Allowances

In the CSCA and CSCI segments, we offer certain customers a volume incentive rebate if specific levels of product purchases are made during a specified period. The accrual for rebates is based on contractual agreements and estimated levels of purchasing. In addition, we have a reserve for product returns, primarily related to damaged and unsaleable products. We also have agreements with certain customers to cover promotional activities related to our products such as coupon programs, new store allowances, and product displays. The accrual for these activities is based on customer agreements and is established at the time product revenue is recognized.

Allowances for customer-related programs are generally recorded at the time of sale based on the estimates and methodologies described above. We continually monitor product sales provisions and re-evaluate these estimates as additional information becomes available, which includes, among other things, an assessment of current market conditions, trade inventory levels, and customer product mix. We make adjustments to these provisions at the end of each reporting period to reflect any such updates to the relevant facts and circumstances.

Income Taxes

Our tax rate is subject to adjustment over the balance of the year due to, among other things, income tax rate changes by governments; the jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to our interpretation of transfer pricing standards; changes in available tax credits, grants and other incentives; changes in stock-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; expiration of or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives; and the repatriation of earnings with respect to which we have not previously provided taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded a net decrease in valuation allowances of $56.6 million, comprised primarily of a decrease in the U.S. valuation allowance related to the acquisition of Ranir and disposal of the Perrigo Animal Health business.

Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable and that we prepare our tax filings in accordance with all applicable tax laws, the final determination with respect to any tax audit, and any related litigation, could be materially different from our estimates or from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on operating results and/or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlements, penalties, and/or interest assessments (refer to Item 8. Note 15).

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in product liability, patent, commercial, regulatory and other legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of business. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within that range is a better estimate, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded. We have established reserves for certain of our legal matters (refer to Item 8. Note 17). We do not incorporate insurance recoveries into our reserves for legal contingencies. We separately record receivables for amounts due under insurance policies when we consider the realization of recoveries for claims to be probable, which may be different than the timing in which we establish the loss reserves.

 77

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

Acquisition Accounting

We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at fair value, with limited exceptions. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the specifically identified assets is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired net assets do not constitute a business, or substantially all of the fair value is in a single asset or group of similar assets, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition and no goodwill is recognized. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date.

Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. The acquired intangible assets can include customer relationships, trademarks, trade names, brands, developed product technology and IPR&D assets. In some of our acquisitions, we acquire IPR&D intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, IPR&D is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed, at which point it then becomes a definite-lived intangible asset, or is determined to have no future use and is then impaired. There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of our intangible assets. We typically use an income approach to value the specifically identifiable intangible assets which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows. We have historically used a relief from royalty or multi-period excess earnings methodology. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically consult with an independent advisor to assist in the valuation of these intangible assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations include discount rates, revenue growth assumptions and expected profit margins. We consider marketplace participant assumptions in determining the amount and timing of future cash flows along with the length of our customer relationships, the attrition, product or technology life cycles, barriers to entry and the risk associated with the cash flows in concluding upon our discount rate. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the purchase accounting. In addition, unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.

Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. With the exception of certain trademarks, trade names, and brands and IPR&D, the majority of our acquired intangible assets are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.

Change in Financial Assets

We valued our contingent milestone payments from Royalty Pharma using a modified Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model ("BSOPM"). Key inputs in the BSOPM are the estimated volatility and rate of return of royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® that are received by Royalty Pharma until the contingent milestones are resolved. Volatility and the estimated fair value of the milestones have a positive relationship such that higher volatility translates to a higher estimated fair value of the contingent milestone payments. We assess volatility and rate of return inputs quarterly by analyzing certain market volatility benchmarks and the risk associated with Royalty Pharma achieving the underlying projected royalties. The table below represents the volatility and rate of return:

-------------- ----------------- - ----------------- ---- -

 Year Ended
 December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018
Volatility 30.0 % 30.0 %
Rate of return 7.92 % 8.05 %

In order for us to receive the milestone payment related to 2020, Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri® sales in 2020 must exceed $351.0 million. If Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri® sales do

 78

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

not meet the prescribed threshold in 2020, we will write-off the $95.3 million asset and record a loss. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will increase the asset to $400.0 million and recognize income of $304.7 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (refer to Item 8. Note 7).

Goodwill

Goodwill represents amounts paid for an acquisition in excess of the fair value of net assets received. We have six reporting units subject to impairment testing annually, which we performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. We performed impairment testing more frequently if events suggest an impairment may exist. We had triggering events during the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019 and the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2018, and we performed interim impairment tests in those periods. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows and market valuation multiples. The estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts, including projected future cash flows that include assumptions about future performance. The discount rates used in testing each of our reporting units’ goodwill for impairment during our interim and annual testing were based on the weighted average cost of capital determined for each of our reporting units. In our annual impairment test as of September 29, 2019, discount rates ranged from 7.5% to 12.0%, and perpetual growth rates ranged from 0.0% to 2.0%. In our annual impairment test as of September 30, 2018, discount rates ranged from 8.5% to 13.8%, and perpetual growth rates ranged from 2.0% to 3.0%. Changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss. We recorded goodwill impairment losses of $109.2 million related to our RX U.S. reporting unit and $136.7 million related to animal health during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which were recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No goodwill impairments were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017.

The goodwill impairment that we recorded in the RX U.S. reporting unit during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019 adjusted the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Changes in discount rates, projected future cash flows, market valuation multiples and other estimates could result in additional goodwill impairment in this reporting unit in future periods.

During our annual goodwill testing as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we determined the fair value of the Branded Consumer Self-care ("BCS") reporting unit included in the CSCI segment was less than 10.0% higher than its net book value in both analyses. We performed additional quantitative analysis during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and concluded that the fair value of the BCS reporting unit remained less than 10.0% higher than its net book value as of December 31, 2018. As a result of the relatively narrow margin between fair value and net book value during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, this reporting unit is at risk for future impairments if it experiences deterioration in business performance or market multiples or increases in discount rates.

During our annual goodwill testing as of September 29, 2019, we determined the fair value of the CSC UK and Australia reporting unit included in the CSCI segment was less than 20.0% higher than its net book value. With a margin between fair value and net book value in this range, the reporting unit is at risk for future goodwill impairments if it experiences deterioration in business performance or market multiples or increases in discount rates.

The discounted cash flow forecasts used for our reporting units include assumptions about future activity levels in the near term and longer-term. If growth in our reporting units is lower than expected, we may experience deterioration in our cash flow forecasts that may indicate goodwill in one or more reporting units is impaired in future impairment tests. We continue to monitor the progress of our reporting units and assess them for potential impairment should impairment indicators arise, as applicable, and at least annually during our fourth quarter impairment testing.

Management performed sensitivity analyses on the discounted cash flow valuations that were prepared to estimate the enterprise values of each reporting unit. Discount rates and perpetual revenue growth rates were increased and decreased by increments of 25 or 50 basis points. For the BCS reporting unit, a 75 basis point increase in the discount rate, or a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate combined with a 25 basis point decrease in the residual growth rate, would indicate potential impairment for this reporting unit. For the CSC UK and

 79

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Critical Accounting Estimates

Australia reporting unit, a 150 basis point increase in the discount rate, or a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate combined with a 50 basis point decrease in the residual growth rate, would indicate potential impairment for this reporting unit. Our sensitivities for both the BCS and CSC UK and Australia reporting units assume a corresponding decrease in market valuation multiples. Based on the sensitivity of the discount rate assumptions on these analyses, an increase in the discount rate over the next twelve months could negatively impact the estimated fair value of the reporting units and lead to a future impairment. Certain macroeconomic factors which are not controlled by the reporting units, such as rising inflation or interest rates, could cause an increase in the discount rate to occur. Deterioration in performance of our reporting units over the next twelve months, such as lower than expected revenue or profitability that has a sustained impact on future periods, could also represent potential indicators of impairment requiring further impairment analysis.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our India API business to Strides Shasun Limited. We received $22.2 million in proceeds, resulting in an immaterial gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to closing the sale, we determined that the carrying value of the India API business exceeded its fair value less the cost to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $35.3 million, which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our Israel API business to SK Capital for a sale price of $110.0 million, which resulted in an immaterial gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Loss on extinguishment of debt $ 0.2 $ 0.5 $ 135.2

Change in Financial Assets

The proceeds from our 2017 sale of the Tysabri® financial asset consisted of $2.2 billion in upfront cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in contingent milestone payments related to 2018 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019 we received the $250.0 million contingent milestone payment.

 During the year ended December 31, 2019 the fair value of the Royalty Pharma milestone payment related to 2020 increased by $22.1 million to $95.3 million. These adjustments were driven by higher projected global net sales of Tysabri® and the estimated probability of achieving the earn-out.

In order for us to receive the milestone payment related to 2020 of $400.0 million, Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri® sales in 2020 must exceed $351.0 million. The Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri® were $337.5 million in 2018. If Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri® sales do not meet the prescribed threshold in 2020, we will write-off the $95.3 million asset and record a loss. If the prescribed threshold is exceeded, we will increase the asset to $400.0 million and recognize income of $304.7 million in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (refer to Item 8. Note 7).

During the year ended December 31, 2018, royalties on global net sales of Tysabri® received by Royalty Pharma met the 2018 threshold resulting in an increase to the asset and a gain of $170.1 million recognized in Change in financial assets on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Also during that period, the fair value of the remaining Royalty Pharma contingent milestone payment related to 2020 increased $18.6 million due to higher projected global net sales of Tysabri® and the estimated probability of achieving the contingent milestone payment related to 2020.

Interest Expense, Net

The $6.3 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was due primarily to changes in our underlying hedge exposure and interest income (refer to Item 8. Note 9).

The $40.1 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was the result of early debt repayments made during the year ended December 31, 2017.

 67

Perrigo Company plc - Item 7
Unallocated, Interest, Other, and Taxes

Other (Income) Expense, Net

The $72.1 million change was due primarily to a $71.7 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our animal health business (refer to Item 8. Note 3)

The $16.2 million decrease during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year was due primarily to the absence of $10.0 million in milestone income related to royalty rights, a $9.5 million loss on our fair value investment securities, and $4.5 million of unfavorable changes in revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies; partially offset by the absence of a $5.9 million loss on hedges related to the extinguishment of debt in the prior year, and a $2.7 million gain on our equity method investments.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $135.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt, which consisted of tender premium on debt repayments, transaction costs, write-off of deferred financing fees, and bond discounts.

Income Taxes (Consolidated)

The effective tax rates were as follows:

----------------- - ----------------- ---- ----------------- ---- -

Year Ended
December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017
 14.6 % 54.9 % 57.3 %

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased in comparison to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the U.S. valuation allowance offset by increased U.S. permanent adjustments largely due to disallowed interest expense.

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased in comparison to the prior year due primarily to the 2017 sale of API Israel and the one-time U.S. transition toll tax, offset by additional tax expense due to valuation allowances in Belgium and state tax recorded for the future distributions of foreign earnings recorded in 2018.

Consolidated

debts owed to Perrigo Company plc by Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Perrigo Company, plc. The debts were incurred in connection with the Elan merger transaction in 2013. The draft NOPA would cap the interest rate on the debts for U.S. federal tax purposes at 130.0% of the Applicable Federal Rate (a blended rate reduction of 4.0% per annum from the rates agreed to by the parties), on the stated ground that the loans were not negotiated on an arms’-length basis. As a result of the proposed interest rate reduction, the draft NOPA proposes a reduction in gross interest expense of approximately $480.0 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. If the IRS were to prevail in its proposed adjustment, we estimate an increase in tax expense for such fiscal years of approximately $170.0 million, excluding interest and penalties. In addition, we would expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for the period from June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2019. If those further adjustments were sustained, based on our preliminary calculations and subject to further analysis, our current best estimate is that the additional tax expense would not exceed $200.0 million, excluding interest and penalties, for the period June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2019. We do not expect any similar adjustments beyond December 31, 2019 as proposed regulations, issued under section 267A of the Internal Revenue Code, would eliminate the deductibility of interest on this debt. We strongly disagree with the IRS position and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies. No payment of any amount related to the proposed adjustments is required to be made, if at all, until all applicable proceedings have been completed.

Following receipt of the draft NOPA, Perrigo provided the IRS with a detailed written response on September 20, 2019. That submission included an analysis by external advisors that supported the original interest rates as being consistent with arms']:

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $448.6 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties. These unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above due to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of settlement with taxing authorities.

Net deferred income tax liabilities were $275.2 million as of December 31, 2019. This amount is not included in the Contractual Obligations table above because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful. Net deferred income tax is settled. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in
