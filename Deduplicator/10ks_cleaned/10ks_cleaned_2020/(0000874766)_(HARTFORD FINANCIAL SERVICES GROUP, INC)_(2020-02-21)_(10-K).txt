Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

from limited partnerships in 2019 that are not assumed to repeat in 2020, and a level of net realized capital gains in 2019 not expected to recur in 2020. Management expects that the 2020 core earnings margin, which does not include the effect of net realized capital gains (losses) or integration costs associated with the acquired business, will be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%, down from a 2019 core earnings margin of 8.9%, primarily due to the expectation of less favorable claim incidence and recoveries on long-term disability claims and lower expected investment income.
Net Income

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Net income increased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a lower group disability loss ratio and a change from net realized capital losses in 2018 to net realized capital gains in 2019. Lower amortization of other intangibles, higher net investment income and lower integration costs were largely offset by higher insurance operating costs and other expenses.
Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher commissions on our voluntary product offerings and investments in technology and claims operations, partially offset by achievements of expense synergies and lower state taxes and assessments.

Fully Insured Ongoing Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Fully insured ongoing premiums were relatively flat in 2019 compared to 2018 as a decrease in group life was offset by an increase in group disability and higher premiums from voluntary products.
Fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 with decreases in group disability and group life, partially offset by an increase in sales of voluntary products. Part of the decrease in fully insured ongoing sales was due to first year sales of the New York Paid Family Leave product in 2018.
Ratios

78

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Total loss ratio decreased 3.0 points from 2018 to 2019 as a decrease in the group disability loss ratio was partially offset by an increase in the group life loss ratio. The group disability loss ratio decreased 5.8 points driven by continued favorable incidence trends and strong claim recoveries on prior incurral year reserves, including the impact of updating our claim recovery probabilities to more recent experience and an experience refund related to the New York Paid Family Leave product.

The group life loss ratio increased 1.1 points, largely due to higher severity.
Expense ratio increased 0.5 points from 2018 to 2019, due to higher commissions on our voluntary product offerings, investments in technology and claims, and higher amortization of DAC, partially offset by achievements of expense synergies and lower state taxes and assessments.

2020 Outlook
Assuming continued growth in equity markets in 2020 and an expectation of positive net flows, the Company expects net income for Hartford Funds to increase from 2019 to 2020. The Company expects to increase net sales in 2020 from a diversified lineup of mutual funds and ETPs, though net flows are more uncertain given the increased volatility in the markets. Assuming the Company can generate positive net flows and fund performance is strong, assets under management are expected to increase modestly despite the expected continued decline of the Talcott Resolution AUM.
Net Income

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Net income increased slightly in 2019 as a change from net realized capital losses in 2018 to net realized capital gains in 2019 was largely offset by the effect of lower investment management fee revenues, an increase in contingent consideration payable associated with the acquisition of Lattice Strategies LLC

("Lattice") and lower state income tax expense in 2018. The decrease in investment management fees was driven by fee reductions and a shift to lower fee funds, partially offset by the effect of slightly higher average daily AUM. See Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Lattice consideration.
Hartford Funds AUM

December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018
Hartford Funds AUM increased from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 due to market appreciation in 2019 across equity, fixed income and multi-strategy funds and exchange traded products. Net flows were slightly positive in 2019 compared to slightly negative net flows in 2018 with net inflows in exchange traded products and fixed income funds offset by net outflows in equity and multi-strategy funds.

Net Income (Loss)

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Net loss compared to net income in 2018 as 2018 included income from discontinued operations related to the life and annuity business sold in May 2018. The loss from continuing operations, net of tax, improved due to an increase in other revenues due to higher earnings on the Company's retained

equity interest in the legal entity that acquired the life and annuity business sold in 2018, lower interest expense, a change to net realized capital gains in 2019 from net realized capital losses in 2018, and greater fee revenue from managing the invested assets of Talcott Resolution post-sale, partially offset by an increase in loss on extinguishment of debt and transaction costs incurred in 2019 related to the Navigators Group acquisition.
Interest Expense

81

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Interest expense decreased primarily due to the maturity of senior notes payable in January 2019 and the redemption of junior subordinated debentures in June 2018, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes in August 2019 in excess of the amount of proceeds used to redeem other outstanding senior notes. On June 15, 2018, The Hartford redeemed $500 aggregate principal amount of its 8.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068. On January 15, 2019,

the Company repaid at maturity the $413 principal amount of its 6.0% senior notes. In third quarter 2019, after receiving net proceeds of $1.38 billion from the issuance of the 2.8% senior notes due August 19, 2029 and 3.6% senior notes due August 19, 2049, The Hartford repaid $265 of 5.75% senior notes due 2023 that had been assumed in the Navigators Group acquisition and $800 of 5.125% senior notes due 2022 of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $90. For additional information, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company’s Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in our Proxy Statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of the Company’s risks.
The Company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. At the senior management level, an Enterprise Risk and Capital Committee (“ERCC”) oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the Company. As illustrated below, a number of functional committees sit underneath the ERCC, providing oversight of specific risk areas and recommending risk mitigation strategies to the ERCC.

-------------------------------------------------

ERCC Members
CEO (Chair)
President
Chief Financial Officer
Chief Investment Officer

General Counsel
Others as deemed necessary by the Committee Chair

------------------------- --------------------------- -------------------------------- -------------------------- ------------------------------------ -------------------------

 ERCC

Asset Liability Committee Underwriting Risk Committee Emerging Risk Steering Committee Operational Risk Committee Economic Capital Executive Committee Model Oversight Committee

The Company's enterprise risk management ("ERM") function supports the ERCC and functional committees, and is tasked with, among other things:

- -----------------------------------
• risk identification and assessment;

- ----------------------------------------------------------
• the development of risk appetites, tolerances, and limits;

- --------------------
• risk monitoring; and

- -------------------------------------
• internal and external risk reporting.

The Company categorizes its main risks as insurance risk, operational risk and financial risk, each of which is described in more detail below.

Insurance Risk
Insurance risk is the risk of losses of both a catastrophic and non-catastrophic nature on the P&C and Group Benefits products the Company has sold. Catastrophe insurance risk is the exposure arising from both natural (e.g., weather, earthquakes, wildfires, pandemics) and man-made catastrophes (e.g., terrorism, cyber-

attacks) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios.
Sources of Insurance Risk Non-catastrophe insurance risks exist within each of the Company's segments except Hartford Funds and include:

- ------------------------------------------------------------
• Property- Risk of loss to personal or commercial property from automobile related accidents, weather, explosions, smoke, shaking, fire, theft, vandalism, inadequate installation, faulty equipment, collisions and falling objects, and/or machinery mechanical breakdown resulting in physical damage and other covered perils.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• Liability- Risk of loss from automobile related accidents, uninsured and underinsured drivers, lawsuits from accidents, defective products, breach of warranty, negligent acts by professional practitioners, environmental claims, latent exposures, fraud, coercion, forgery, failure to fulfill obligations per contract surety, liability from errors and omissions, losses from political and credit coverages, losses

82

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

from derivative lawsuits, and other securities actions and covered perils.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Mortality- Risk of loss from unexpected trends in insured deaths impacting timing of payouts from group life insurance, personal or commercial automobile related accidents, and death of employees or executives during the course of employment, while on disability, or while collecting workers compensation benefits.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Morbidity- Risk of loss to an insured from illness incurred during the course of employment or illness from other covered perils.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Disability- Risk of loss incurred from personal or commercial automobile related losses, accidents arising outside of the workplace, injuries or accidents incurred during the course of employment, or from equipment, with each loss resulting in short term or long-term disability payments.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Longevity- Risk of loss from increased life expectancy trends among policyholders receiving long-term benefit payments.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Cyber Insurance- Risk of loss to property, breach of data and business interruption from various types of cyber-attacks.

Catastrophe risk primarily arises in the property, automobile, workers' compensation, casualty, group life, and group disability lines of business.
Impact Non-catastrophe insurance risk can arise from unexpected loss experience, underpriced business and/or underestimation of loss reserves and can have significant effects

on the Company’s earnings. Catastrophe insurance risk can arise from various unpredictable events and can have significant effects on the Company's earnings and may result in losses that could constrain its liquidity.
Management The Company's policies and procedures for managing these risks include disciplined underwriting protocols, exposure controls, sophisticated risk-based pricing, risk modeling, risk transfer, and capital management strategies. The Company has established underwriting guidelines for both individual risks, including individual policy limits, and risks in the aggregate, including aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril. The Company uses both internal and third-party models to estimate the potential loss resulting from various catastrophe events and the potential financial impact those events would have on the Company's financial position and results of operations across its businesses.
In addition, certain insurance products offered by The Hartford provide coverage for losses incurred due to cyber events and the Company has assessed and modeled how those products would respond to different events in order to manage its aggregate exposure to losses incurred under the insurance policies we sell.  The Company models numerous deterministic scenarios including losses caused by malware, data breach, distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions of cloud environments and attacks of power grids.
Among specific risk tolerances set by the Company, risk limits are set for natural catastrophes, terrorism risk and pandemic risk.

Risk Definition Details and Company Limits
Natural catastrophe Exposure arising from natural phenomena (e.g., earthquakes, wildfires, etc.) that create a concentration or aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios and the inherent volatility of weather or climate pattern changes. The Company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss as a result of natural catastrophes for property & casualty exposures from a single 250-year event to less than 30% of the projected total available capital at year end of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries prior to reinsurance and to less than 15% of the projected total available capital at year end of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries after reinsurance. From time to time the estimated loss to natural catastrophes from a single 250-year event prior to reinsurance may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures or statutory surplus. [2]
 - The estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum loss from earthquake events is estimated to be $1.1 billion before reinsurance and $408 million net of reinsurance. [1]
 - The estimated 250 year pre-tax probable maximum losses from hurricane events are estimated to be $1.8 billion before reinsurance and $906 net of reinsurance. [1]
Terrorism The risk of losses from terrorist attacks, including losses caused by single-site and multi-site conventional attacks, as well as the potential for attacks using nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological weapons (“NBCR”). Enterprise limits for terrorism apply to aggregations of risk across property-casualty, group benefits and specific asset portfolios and are defined based on a deterministic, single-site conventional terrorism attack scenario. The Company manages its potential estimated loss from a conventional terrorism loss scenario, up to $2.0 billion net of reinsurance and $2.5 billion gross of reinsurance, before coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program established under “TRIPRA”. In addition, the Company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and vendor-licensed loss modeling tools as part of its risk management discipline. Our modeled exposures to conventional terrorist attacks around landmark locations may fluctuate above and below our stated limits.
Pandemic The exposure to loss arising from widespread influenza or other pathogens or bacterial infections that create an aggregation of loss across the Company's insurance or asset portfolios. The Company generally limits its estimated pre-tax loss from a single 250 year pandemic event to less than 18% of the aggregate projected total available capital at year end of the property and casualty and group benefits insurance subsidiaries. In evaluating these scenarios, the Company assesses the impact on group life, short-term disability, long-term disability and property & casualty claims. While ERM has a process to track and manage these limits, from time to time, the estimated loss for pandemics may fluctuate above or below these limits due to changes in modeled loss estimates, exposures, or statutory surplus. In addition, the Company assesses losses in the investment portfolio associated with market declines in the event of a widespread pandemic. [2]

--- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] The loss estimates represent total property losses for hurricane events and property and workers compensation losses for earthquake events resulting from a single event. The estimates provided are based on 250-year return period loss estimates that have a 0.4% likelihood of being exceeded in any single year. The net loss estimates provided assume that the Company is able to recover all losses ceded to reinsurers under its reinsurance programs. The Company also manages natural catastrophe risk for group life and group disability, which in combination with property and workers compensation loss estimates are subject to separate enterprise risk management net aggregate loss limits as a percent of enterprise surplus.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] For U.S. insurance subsidiaries other than Navigators Insurers, total available capital is equal to actual statutory capital and surplus. For Navigators Insurers, including in U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, total available capital is equal to U.S. GAAP equity of those subsidiaries less certain assets such as goodwill, intangible assets, deferred taxes and other adjustments, including discounting.

Reinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy
In addition to the policies and procedures outlined above, the Company uses reinsurance to transfer certain risks to reinsurance companies based on specific geographic or risk concentrations. A variety of traditional reinsurance products are used as part of the Company's risk management strategy, including excess of loss occurrence-based products that reinsure property and workers' compensation exposures, and individual risk (including facultative reinsurance) or quota share arrangements, that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. The Company has no significant finite risk contracts in place and the statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial. The Hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”), the Terrorism Risk

Insurance Program (“TRIPRA”) and other reinsurance programs relating to particular risks or specific lines of business.
Reinsurance for Catastrophes- The Company utilizes various reinsurance programs to mitigate catastrophe losses including excess of loss occurrence-based treaties covering property and workers’ compensation, and an aggregate property catastrophe treaty as well as individual risk agreements (including facultative reinsurance) that reinsure losses from specific classes or lines of business. The aggregate property catastrophe treaty covers the aggregate of catastrophe events designated by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk and, for international business, net losses arising from two or more risks involved in the same loss occurrence totaling at least $500 thousand.

Losses of $0 to $100 from one event None 100% retained
Losses of $100 to $450 from one event [5] 80% of $350 in excess of $100 20% co-participation

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] As of January 1, 2020 Navigators Group (Global Specialty) is included in the Corporate Property Catastrophe treaties. These treaties do not cover the assumed reinsurance business which purchases its own retrocessional coverage.

--- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] In addition to the Property Occurrence Treaty, for Florida events, The Hartford has purchased the mandatory FHCF reinsurance for the period from 6/1/2019 to 5/30/2020. Retention and coverage varies by writing company. The writing company with the largest coverage under FHCF is Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest, with coverage for approximately $67 of per event losses in excess of a $27 retention.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3] Portions of this layer of coverage extend beyond a traditional one year term.

-----------------------------------
[4] The aggregate treaty is not limited to a single event; rather, it is designed to provide reinsurance protection for the aggregate of all catastrophe events (up to $350 per event), either designated by the Property Claim Services office of Verisk or, for international business, net losses arising from two or more risks involved in the same loss occurrence totaling at least $500 thousand. All catastrophe losses apply toward satisfying the $700 attachment point under the aggregate treaty.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5] In addition to the limits shown, the workers' compensation reinsurance includes a non-catastrophe, industrial accident layer, providing coverage for 80% of $30 in per event losses in excess of a $20 retention.

In addition to the property catastrophe reinsurance coverage described in the above table, the Company has other reinsurance agreements that cover property catastrophe losses. The Per Occurrence Property Catastrophe Treaty, and Workers' Compensation Catastrophe Treaty include a provision to reinstate one limit in the event that a catastrophe loss exhausts limits on one or more layers under the treaties.
Reinsurance for Terrorism- For the risk of terrorism, private sector catastrophe reinsurance capacity is generally limited and largely unavailable for terrorism losses caused by nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. As such, the Company's principal reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA to the end of 2027.
TRIPRA provides a backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of terrorism”, which is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, for losses that exceed a threshold of industry losses of $200 billion. Under the program, in any one calendar year, the federal government will pay a percentage of losses incurred from a certified act of terrorism after an insurer's losses exceed 20% of the Company's eligible direct commercial earned premiums of the prior calendar year up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of $100 billion. The percentage of losses paid by the federal government is 80% . The Company's estimated deductible under the program is $1.5 billion for 2020. If an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual industry aggregate limit,

Congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid.
Reinsurance for A&E and Navigators Group Reserve Development - The Company has two adverse development cover (“ADC”) reinsurance agreements in place, both of which are accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. One agreement covers substantially all A&E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years (the “A&E ADC”) and the other covers substantially all reserve development of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates for 2018 and prior accident years (“Navigators ADC”). For more information on the A&E ADC and the Navigators ADC, see Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 11, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.

Reinsurance Recoverables
Property and casualty insurance product reinsurance recoverables represent loss and loss adjustment expense recoverables from a number of entities, including reinsurers and pools.

To manage reinsurer credit risk, a reinsurance security review committee evaluates the credit standing, financial performance, management and operational quality of each potential reinsurer. In placing reinsurance, the Company considers the nature of the risk reinsured, including the expected liability payout duration, and establishes limits tiered by reinsurer credit rating.

Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group wide offsets. As part of its reinsurance recoverable review, the Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedants and reinsurers and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. As indicated in the above table, excluding mandatory pools and structured settlements, 84.0% of the gross reinsurance recoverables due from reinsurers rated by A.M. Best were rated A- (excellent) or better as of December 31, 2019.
Annually, the Company completes evaluations of the reinsurance recoverable asset associated with older, long-term casualty liabilities reported in the Property & Casualty Other Operations reporting segment, and the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reported in the Commercial Lines reporting segment. For a discussion regarding the results of these evaluations, see MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates, Property and Casualty Insurance Product Reserves, Net of Reinsurance.
Group Benefits reinsurance recoverables represent reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses and other policyholder funds and benefits payable that are recoverable from a number of reinsurers.

Guaranty Funds and Other Insurance-related Assessments
As part of its risk management strategy, the Company regularly monitors the financial strength of other insurers and, in particular, activity by insurance regulators and various state guaranty associations in the U.S. relating to troubled insurers. In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund.

Operational Risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, human error, or from external events.
Sources of Operational Risk Operational risk is inherent in the Company's business and functional areas. Operational risks include: compliance with laws and regulation, cybersecurity, business disruption, technology failure, inadequate execution or process management, reliance on model and data analytics, internal fraud, external fraud, third party dependency and attraction and retention of talent.

86

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Impact Operational risk can result in financial loss, disruption of our business, regulatory actions or damage to our reputation.
Management Responsibility for day-to-day management of operational risk lies within each business unit and functional area. ERM provides an enterprise-wide view of the Company's operational risk on an aggregate basis. ERM is responsible for establishing, maintaining and communicating the framework, principles and guidelines of the Company's operational risk management program. Operational risk mitigation strategies include the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
• Establishing policies and monitoring risk tolerances and exceptions;

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Conducting business risk assessments and implementing action plans where necessary;

- ------------------------------------------------
• Validating existing crisis management protocols;

- ----------------------------------------------
• Identifying and monitoring emerging risks; and

- ------------------------------
• Purchasing insurance coverage.

Cybersecurity Risk
The Hartford has implemented an information protection program with established governance routines that promote an adaptive approach for assessing and managing risks. The Hartford employs a ‘defense-in-depth’ strategy that uses multiple security measures to protect the integrity of the Company's information assets. This ‘defense-in-depth’ strategy aligns to the National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") Cyber Security Framework and provides preventative, detective and responsive measures that collectively protects the Company. Various cyber assurance methods, including security metrics, third party security assessments, external penetration testing, red team exercises, and cyber war game exercises are used to test the effectiveness of the overall cybersecurity control environment.
The Hartford, like many other large financial services companies, blocks attempted cyber intrusions on a daily basis. In the event of a cyber intrusion, the Company invokes its Cyber Incident Response Program (the "Program") commensurate with the nature of the intrusion. While the actual methods employed differ based on the event, our approach uses internal teams and outside advisors with specialized skills to support the response and recovery efforts and requires elevation of issues, as necessary, to senior management. In addition, we have procedures to ensure timely notification of critical cybersecurity incidents pursuant to the Program to help identify employees who may have material non-public information and to implement blackout restrictions on trading the Company's securities during the investigation and assessment of such cybersecurity incidents.
From a governance perspective, senior members of our Enterprise Risk Management, Information Protection and Internal Audit functions provide detailed, regular reports on cybersecurity matters to the Board, including the Finance, Investment, and Risk Management Committee (FIRMCo), a committee comprised of all directors, which has principal responsibility for oversight of cybersecurity risk, and/or the Audit Committee, which oversees controls for the Company's major risk exposures. The topics covered by these updates include the Company's activities, policies and procedures to prevent, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, as well as lessons learned

from cybersecurity incidents and internal and external testing of our cyber defenses.

Financial Risk
Financial risks include direct and indirect risks to the Company's financial objectives from events that impact financial market conditions and the value of financial assets. Some events may cause correlated movement in multiple risk factors. The primary sources of financial risks are the Company's invested assets.
Consistent with its risk appetite, the Company establishes financial risk limits to control potential loss on a U.S. GAAP, statutory, and economic basis. Exposures are actively monitored and managed, with risks mitigated where appropriate. The Company uses various risk management strategies, including limiting aggregation of risk, portfolio re-balancing and hedging with over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives with counterparties meeting the appropriate regulatory and due diligence requirements. Derivatives are utilized to achieve one of four Company-approved objectives: hedging risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rate risk or volatility; managing liquidity; controlling transaction costs; or entering into synthetic replication transactions. Derivative activities are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s compliance and risk management teams and reviewed by senior management. The Company identifies different categories of financial risk, including liquidity, credit, interest rate, equity and foreign currency exchange.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk to current or prospective earnings or capital arising from the Company's inability or perceived inability to meet its contractual funding obligations as they come due.
Sources of Liquidity Risk Sources of liquidity risk include funding risk, company-specific liquidity risk and market liquidity risk resulting from differences in the amount and timing of sources and uses of cash as well as company-specific and general market conditions. Stressed market conditions may impact the ability to sell assets or otherwise transact business and may result in a significant loss in value.
Impact Inadequate capital resources and liquidity could negatively affect the Company’s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows from its businesses, borrow funds at competitive rates, and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs.
Management The Company has defined ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements to assess liquidity across the enterprise under both current and stressed market conditions. The Company measures and manages liquidity risk exposures and funding needs within prescribed limits across legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory and operational limitations to the transferability liquidity. The Company also monitors internal and external conditions, and identifies material risk changes and emerging risks that may impact operating cash flows or liquid assets. The liquidity requirements of the Holding Company have been and will continue to be met by the Holding Company's fixed maturities, short-term investments and cash, and dividends from its subsidiaries, principally its insurance operations, as well as the issuance of common stock, debt or

87

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

other capital securities and borrowings from its credit facilities as needed. The Company maintains multiple sources of contingent liquidity including a revolving credit facility, a commercial paper program, an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among the HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates, and access to collateralized advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ("FHLBB") for certain affiliates. The Company's CFO has primary responsibility for liquidity risk.
For further discussion on liquidity see the section on Capital Resources and Liquidity.

Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk
Credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with contractually agreed upon terms. Credit risk is comprised of three major factors: the risk of change in credit quality, or credit migration risk; the risk of default; and the risk of a change in value due to changes in credit spreads.
Sources of Credit Risk The majority of the Company’s credit risk is concentrated in its investment holdings and use of derivatives, but it is also present in the Company’s ceded reinsurance activities and various insurance products.
Impact A decline in creditworthiness is typically reflected as an increase in an investment’s credit spread and associated decline in value, potentially resulting in an increase in other-than-temporary impairment, and an increased probability of a realized loss upon sale. In certain instances, counterparties may default on their obligations and the Company may realize a loss on default. Premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverable and deductible losses recoverable are also subject to credit risk based on the counterparty’s unwillingness or inability to pay.
Management The objective of the Company’s enterprise credit risk management strategy is to identify, quantify, and manage credit risk in aggregate and to limit potential losses in accordance with the Company's credit risk management policy. The Company manages its credit risk by managing aggregations of risk, holding a diversified mix of issuers and counterparties across its investment, reinsurance, and insurance portfolios and limiting exposure to any specific reinsurer or counterparty. Potential credit losses can be mitigated through diversification (e.g., geographic regions, asset types, industry sectors), hedging and the use of collateral to reduce net credit exposure.
The Company manages credit risk through the use of various analyses and governance processes. The investment, derivatives and reinsurance areas have formal policies and procedures for counterparty approvals and authorizations, which establish criteria defining minimum levels of creditworthiness and financial stability for eligible counterparties. Credits considered for investment are subject to underwriting reviews and private securities are subject to management approval. Mitigation strategies vary across the three sources of credit risk, but may include:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
• Investing in a portfolio of high-quality and diverse securities;

- -------------------------------------------
• Selling investments subject to credit risk;

- --------------------------------------------
• Hedging through use of credit default swaps;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Clearing transactions through central clearing houses that require daily variation margin;

- ------------------------------------------------------------------
• Entering into contracts only with strong creditworthy institutions

- -------------------------
• Requiring collateral; and

- --------------------------------------------------------
• Non-renewing policies/contracts or reinsurance treaties.

The Company has developed credit exposure thresholds which are based upon counterparty ratings. Aggregate counterparty credit quality and exposure are monitored on a daily basis utilizing an enterprise-wide credit exposure information system that contains data on issuers, ratings, exposures, and credit limits. Exposures are tracked on a current and potential basis and aggregated by ultimate parent of the counterparty across investments, reinsurance receivables, insurance products with credit risk, and derivatives.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer or counterparty greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies. For further discussion of concentration of credit risk in the investment portfolio, see the Concentration of Credit Risk section in Note 6 - Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Credit Risk

Investments Essentially all of the Company's invested assets are subject to credit risk. Credit related impairments on investments were $3 and $1, in 2019 and 2018, respectively. (See the Enterprise Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Other-Than-Temporary Impairments.”)

Reinsurance recoverables Reinsurance recoverables, net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, were $5,527 and $4,357, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (See the Enterprise Risk Management section of the MD&A under “Reinsurance as a Risk Management Strategy.”)

Premiums receivable and agents' balances Premiums receivable and agents’ balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, were $4,384 and $3,995, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (For a discussion regarding collectibility of these balances, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the section labeled “Revenue Recognition.”)

Credit Risk of Derivatives
The Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction.
Downgrades to the credit ratings of the Company’s insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative

88

counterparties for OTC derivatives and clearing brokers for OTC-cleared derivatives the right to cancel and settle outstanding derivative trades or require additional collateral to be posted. In addition, downgrades may result in counterparties and clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require additional collateralization before entering into any new trades.
Managing the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments
The Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations. The Company’s policies with respect to derivative counterparty exposure establishes market-based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness of the counterparty and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management.
The Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA") Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the ISDA agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds.
The Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. Credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s net fair value, including income accruals, of all derivative positions transacted with a single counterparty for each separate legal entity. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk.  The Company enters into collateral arrangements in connection with its derivatives positions and collateral is pledged to or held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the exposure is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds or negotiated thresholds. In accordance with industry standards and the contractual requirements, collateral is typically settled on the same business day. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred no losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty default. For further discussion, see the Derivative Commitments section of Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Credit Derivatives
The Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield.
Credit Risk Reduced Through Credit Derivatives
The Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity or referenced index. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit

protection was $124 and $6, respectively, while the fair value was $(3) and $0, respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.
Credit Risk Assumed Through Credit Derivatives
The Company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies. These swaps reference investment grade single corporate issuers and indexes. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that assume credit risk was $500 and $1.1 billion, respectively, while the fair value was $13 and $3, respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.
For further information on credit derivatives, see Note 7 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Credit Risk of Business Operations
A portion of the company's commercial business is written with large deductible policies or retrospectively-rated plans. Under some commercial insurance contracts with deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the contract holder for the deductible amount, and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. Additionally, retrospectively rated policies are utilized primarily for workers compensation coverage, whereby the ultimate premium is determined based on actual loss activity. Although the retrospectively rated feature of the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it does introduce credit risk to the Company. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant portion of such contract holders failed to reimburse the Company for the deductible amount or the retrospectively rated policyholders failed to pay additional premiums owed. While the Company attempts to manage the risks discussed above through underwriting, credit analysis, collateral requirements, provision for bad debt, and other oversight mechanisms, the Company’s efforts may not be successful.

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities arising from movements in interest rates. Interest rate risk encompasses exposures with respect to changes in the level of interest rates, the shape of the term structure of rates and the volatility of interest rates. Interest rate risk does not include exposure to changes in credit spreads.
Sources of Interest Rate Risk The Company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from its fixed maturity investments, commercial mortgage loans, capital securities issued by the Company and discount rate assumptions associated with the Company’s claim reserves and pension and other post retirement benefit obligations as well as from assets that support the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.
Impact Changes in interest rates from current levels can have both favorable and unfavorable effects for the Company.

89

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change in Interest Rates Favorable Effects Unfavorable Effects
Ý Additional net investment income due to reinvesting at higher yields Decrease in the fair value of the fixed income investment portfolio
 Higher interest expense on variable rate debt obligations
Þ Increase in the fair value of the fixed income investment portfolio Lower net investment income due to reinvesting at lower investment yields
 Acceleration in paydowns and prepayments or calls of certain mortgage-backed and municipal securities

Management The Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by constructing investment portfolios that seek to protect the firm from the economic impact associated with changes in interest rates by setting portfolio duration targets that are aligned with the duration of the liabilities that they support. The Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including parametric models and cash flow simulation under various market scenarios of the liabilities and their supporting investment portfolios. Key metrics that the Company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and the associated liabilities include duration, convexity and key rate duration.
The Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk associated with its investment portfolio or to hedge liabilities. Interest rate caps, floors, swaps, swaptions, and futures may be used to manage portfolio duration. Interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts or payments to a fixed or variable rate. The use of such swaps enables the Company to customize contract terms and conditions to desired objectives and manage the duration profile within established tolerances. Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flows of a forecasted purchase or sale of fixed rate securities due to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk, including offsetting positions, totaled $11.4 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively primarily related to investments. The fair value of these derivatives was $(59) and $(61) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Interest Rate Risk

Fixed income investments The fair value of fixed income investments, which include fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans, and short-term investments, was $49.3 billion and $43.7 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The weighted average duration of the portfolio, including derivative instruments, was approximately 5.0 years and 4.7 years as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in the fair value of fixed maturities due to changes in interest rates are reflected as a component of AOCI.

Long-term debt obligations The Company's variable rate debt obligations will generally result in increased interest expense as a result of higher interest rates; the inverse is true during a declining interest rate environment. Changes in the value of long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of these instruments but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Group life and disability product liabilities The cash outflows associated with contracts issued by the Company's Group Benefits segment, primarily group life and short and long-term disability policy liabilities, are not interest rate sensitive but vary based on timing. Though the aggregate cash flow payment streams are relatively predictable, these products rely upon actuarial pricing assumptions (including mortality and morbidity) and have an element of cash flow uncertainty. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $8,256 and $8,445, respectively of reserves for group life and disability contracts. Changes in the value of the liabilities as a result of changes in interest rates will impact the fair value of these instruments but not the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

90

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations The Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations are exposed to interest rate risk based upon the sensitivity of present value obligations to changes in liability discount rates as well as the sensitivity of the fair value of investments in the plan portfolios to changes in interest rates. The discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve that reflects high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. The Company is exposed to the risk of having to make additional plan contributions if the plans’ investment returns, including from investments in fixed maturities, are lower than expected. (For further discussion of discounting pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, refer to Note 18 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had $732 and $791, respectively, of unfunded liabilities for pension and post-retirement benefit obligations recorded within Other Liabilities in the accompanying Balance Sheets.

Interest Rate Sensitivity
Group Life and Disability Reserves and Invested Assets Supporting Them
Included in the following table is the before tax change in the net economic value of contracts issued by the Company’s Group Benefits segment, primarily group life and disability, for which fixed valuation discount rate assumptions are established based upon investment returns assumed in pricing, along with the corresponding invested assets. Also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by the Company to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the investment portfolios supporting these contracts. This analysis does not include the assets and corresponding liabilities of other insurance products such as automobile, property, workers' compensation and general liability insurance. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments. The calculation of the estimated hypothetical change in net economic value below assumes a 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve.
The selection of the 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as an illustration of the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. The Company’s sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations, significant product sales or non-parallel changes in interest rates.

Interest Rate Sensitivity of Group Benefits Short and Long-term Disability Reserves and Invested Assets Supporting Them

------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------- ---- ---- - ---- - ---- -- - --- -

 Change in Net Economic Value as of December 31,
 2019 2018
Basis point shift -100 +100 -100 +100
Increase (decrease) in economic value, before tax $ 83 $ (101 ) $ 47 $ (68 )

The carrying value of assets supporting the liabilities related to the businesses included in the table above was $10.6 billion and $10.0 billion, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and included fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments. The assets supporting the liabilities are monitored and managed within set duration guidelines and are evaluated on a daily basis, as well as annually, using scenario simulation techniques in compliance with regulatory requirements.
Invested Assets not Supporting Group Life and Disability Reserves
The following table provides an analysis showing the estimated before tax change in the fair value of the Company’s investments and related derivatives, excluding assets supporting group life and disability reserves which are included in the table above, assuming 100 basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships and other alternative investments, have been omitted from the analysis as the interest rate sensitivity of these investments is generally lower and less predictable than fixed income investments.

The carrying value of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loans and short-term investments related to the businesses included in the table above was $38.7 billion and $33.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Long-term Debt
A 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would result in an increase in the fair value of long-term debt by $607 and $331 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would result in a decrease in the fair value of long-term debt by $499 and $279 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in the value of long-term debt as a result of changes in interest rates will not impact the carrying value in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

91

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Pension and Other Post-Retirement Plan Obligations
A 100 basis point parallel decrease in the yield curve would impact both the value of the underlying pension assets and the value of the liability, resulting in an increase in the unfunded liabilities for pension and other post-retirement plan obligations of $185 and $178 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A 100 basis point parallel increase in the yield curve would have the inverse effect and result in a decrease in the unfunded liabilities for pension and other post-retirement plan obligations of $138 and $134 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Gains or losses due to changes in interest rates on the pension and post-retirement plan obligations are recorded within AOCI and are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold.
Discontinuation of LIBOR The Company continues to monitor the potential impacts of the discontinuation of LIBOR which is used as a benchmark or reference rate for certain investments and derivatives the Company owns and floating rate debt the Company has issued. The Company has identified three principal types of outstanding contracts that may be affected by the discontinuation of or transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including floating rate fixed maturity investments the Company holds in its investment portfolio; derivative instruments that hedge interest rate risk; and two classes of junior subordinated debentures that the Company has issued and are currently outstanding.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Using our best estimate of expected future cash flows including prepayments and maturities, the book value of LIBOR referenced floating rate fixed maturities that the Company owns as of December 31, 2019 and that the Company expects to be outstanding at the end of 2021, is approximately $2.7 billion. The Company has performed a review of the LIBOR replacement language on these assets and believes that greater than 80% have language that supports a transition to a new standard benchmark rate. The Company will continue to assess the remaining holdings and work with counterparties, as appropriate, to determine LIBOR replacement language or manage the assets in other ways, such as through asset sales.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The notional amount of derivative instruments as of December, 31, 2019 with a floating rate component that references LIBOR that the Company expects to be outstanding at the end of 2021, considering maturities, is $10.3 billion, with $10.1 billion being cleared through an exchange or clearinghouse. The Company anticipates that substantially all existing derivatives referencing LIBOR, whether or not cleared through an exchange or clearing house, will transition from LIBOR to SOFR or other market alternative rates in line with new market standards currently being developed.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The Company has issued $1.1 billion of junior subordinated debentures that mature after 2021 with LIBOR referenced floating interest rates. The Company is assessing options to manage the risk associated with the transition away from LIBOR related to these outstanding securities.

The uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR, including the timing of such transition, could reduce the value of some of our floating rate fixed maturity investments and

increase the interest the Company pays on the junior subordinated debentures.
There is also a risk that certain derivatives may no longer qualify for hedge accounting if reference rates change on derivative contracts but the reference interest rate of the instruments being hedged do not change in a substantially similar manner, particularly for cash flow hedges of floating rate investments the Company owns and junior subordinated debentures the Company has issued. The loss of hedge accounting could result in the recognition of gains or losses on derivatives in the income statement rather than in accumulated other comprehensive income. The FASB has proposed guidance that would allow companies to continue to apply hedge accounting in these instances for one year after year end 2021 when the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is expected to stop requiring financial institutions to publish LIBOR rates. Beyond the one year period ending 2022, there is uncertainty whether certain outstanding derivative contracts will continue to qualify for hedge accounting either because the replacement rate of the financial instrument being hedged is not sufficiently matched to the reference rate of the derivative contract or because replacement rate language for the hedged instrument has not been determined.

Equity Risk
Equity risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the value of global equities or equity indices.
Sources of Equity Risk The Company has exposure to equity risk from invested assets, assets that support the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, and fee income derived from Hartford Funds assets under management. In addition, the Company has equity exposure through its 9.7% ownership interest in the limited partnership, Hopmeadow Holdings LP, that owns the life and annuity business sold in 2018. For further information, see Note 21 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Impact The investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and derivatives, alternative assets and limited partnerships which could negatively impact the Company's reported earnings. For assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, the Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. Hartford Funds earnings are also significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of assets under management and the amount of fee income generated from those assets. Increases in equity markets will generally have the inverse impact.
Management The Company uses various approaches in managing its equity exposure, including limits on the proportion of assets invested in equities, diversification of the equity portfolio, and hedging of changes in equity indices. For assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, the asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. In order to minimize risk, the pension plans maintain a listing of permissible and prohibited investments and impose concentration limits and investment quality requirements on permissible investment options.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Equity Risk

Investment portfolio The investment portfolio is exposed to losses from market declines affecting equity securities and derivatives, and certain alternative assets and limited partnerships. Generally, declines in equity markets will reduce the value of these types of investments and could negatively impact the Company’s earnings while increases in equity will have the inverse impact. For equity securities, the changes in fair value are reported in net realized capital gains and losses. For alternative assets and limited partnerships, the Company's share of earnings for the period is recorded in net investment income, though typically on a delay based on the availability of the underlying financial statements. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below.

Assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans The Company may be required to make additional plan contributions if equity investments in the plan portfolios decline in value. For a discussion of equity sensitivity, see below.
Declines in value are recognized as unrealized losses in AOCI. Increases in equity markets are recognized as unrealized gains in AOCI. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold. For further discussion of equity risk associated with the pension plans, see Note 18 - Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to

Consolidated Financial Statements.

Assets under management Assets under management in Hartford Funds may decrease in value during equity market declines, which would result in lower earnings because fee income is earned based upon the value of assets under management.

Equity Sensitivity
Investment portfolio and the assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans
Included in the following tables are the estimated before tax change in the economic value of the Company’s invested assets and assets supporting pension and other post-retirement benefit plans with sensitivity to equity risk. The calculation of the hypothetical change in economic value below assumes a 20% upward and downward shock to the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Price Index ("S&P 500"). For limited partnerships and other alternative investments, the movement in economic value is calculated using a beta analysis largely derived from historical experience relative to the S&P 500.
The selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration to the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially from those illustrated below due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. These calculations do not capture the impact of portfolio re-allocations.

Hartford Funds assets under management
Hartford Funds earnings are significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. If equity markets were to hypothetically decline 20% and remain depressed for one year, the estimated before tax impact on reported earnings for that one year period is $(50) as of December 31, 2019.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk of financial loss due to changes in the relative value between currencies.
Sources of Currency Risk The Company has foreign currency exchange risk in non-U.S. dollar denominated cash, fixed maturities, equities, and derivative instruments. In addition, the Company has non-U.S. subsidiaries, some with functional currencies other than U.S. dollar, and which transact business in multiple currencies resulting in assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
Impact Changes in relative values between currencies can create variability in cash flows and realized or unrealized gains and losses on changes in the value of assets and liabilities. The impact on the fair value of fixed maturities, AFS due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in relation to functional currency, is reported in unrealized gains or losses as part of other comprehensive income. The realization of gains or losses resulting from investment sales or resulting from changes in investments that record fair value through the income statement due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is reflected through net realized capital gains and losses.
In regards to insurance and reinsurance contracts that the Company enters into for which we are obligated to pay losses in a foreign currency, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities related to these contracts is reflected through net realized capital gains and losses. These assets or liabilities include, but are not limited to, cash and cash equivalents, premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables, and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. Additionally, the Company translates the assets, liabilities, and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities into U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income.
Management The Company manages its foreign currency exchange risk primarily through asset-liability matching and through the use of derivative instruments. However, legal entity capital is invested in local currencies in order to satisfy regulatory requirements and to support local insurance operations. The foreign currency exposure of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments will most commonly be reduced through the sale of the assets or through hedges using foreign currency swaps and forwards.

Assets and Liabilities Subject to Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Investment portfolio The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk affecting non-U.S. dollar denominated cash, fixed maturities, equities and derivative instruments. Changes in relative values between currencies can positively or negatively impact net realized capital gains and losses or unrealized gains (losses) as part of other comprehensive income.

Assets supporting pension plan Changes in relative values between currencies can positively or negatively impact unrealized gains and losses in AOCI. Unrealized gains and losses in AOCI are amortized into the actuarial loss component of net periodic benefit cost when they exceed a threshold. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had pension plan assets of $83 and $68, respectively, of non-U.S. dollar investments in multiple currencies. These amounts are excluded from the sensitivity analysis below.

Insurance contract related assets and liabilities The Company has non-U.S. dollar denominated insurance contracts and associated premiums receivable, reinsurance recoverables and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, that are exposed to foreign exchange risk. For contracts that are within U.S, dollar functional currency legal entities, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can positively or negatively impact net realized capital gains and losses. For contracts within non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities, changes in foreign currency exchange rates can positively or negatively impact other comprehensive income.

Foreign Currency Sensitivity
For the Company’s primary currencies that create foreign exchange risk, the following table provides the estimated impact of a hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in exchange rates. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis. The amounts presented are in U.S. dollars and before-tax.

Financial Risk on Statutory Capital
Statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease in any period depending upon a variety of factors and

may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. In general, as equity market levels and interest rates decline, the amount and volatility of either our

94

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially negatively affected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• A decrease in the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, due in part to credit spreads widening or a decline in equity market levels, may result in a decrease in statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Non-market factors can also impact the amount and volatility of either our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin.

Most of these factors are outside of the Company’s control. The Company’s financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.

Investment Portfolio Risk
The following table presents the Company’s fixed maturities, AFS, by credit quality. The credit ratings referenced throughout this section are based on availability and are generally the midpoint of the available ratings among Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.

The fair value of fixed maturities, AFS increased as compared to December 31, 2018, primarily due to the transfer in of assets related to the acquisition of Navigators Group as well as an increase in valuations due to lower interest rates and tighter

credit spreads. Fixed Maturities, FVO, are not included in the preceding table. For further discussion on FVO securities, see Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The fair value of AFS securities increased as compared with December 31, 2018, primarily due to the transfer in of assets related to the acquisition of Navigators Group as well as an increase in valuations due to lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads.
European Exposure
While the European economy is showing signs of stabilization, structural challenges including elevated sovereign debt levels and demographic headwinds are expected to suppress economic

growth in the region. Political risk will likely remain elevated in Europe during 2020 due to uncertainty surrounding Brexit, increasing pressure on centrist governments in France and Germany and ongoing concern over Italian fiscal policy.  The Company manages the credit risk associated with its European securities within the investment portfolio on an on-going basis using several processes which are supported by macroeconomic analysis and issuer credit analysis.
For additional details regarding the Company’s management of credit risk, see the Credit Risk section of this MD&A.

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s European investment exposure had an amortized cost of $3.0 billion and a fair value of $3.1 billion, or 6% of total invested assets; as of December 31, 2018, both the amortized cost and fair value totaled $2.5 billion. The investment exposure largely relates to corporate entities which are domiciled in or generate a significant portion of their revenue within the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, and Sweden. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the weighted average credit quality of European investments was A-. Entities domiciled in the United Kingdom comprise the Company's largest European exposure; as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the U.K. exposure totals less than

3% of total invested assets and largely relates to the industrial, sovereign, and financial services sectors and has an average credit rating of A-. The majority of the European investments are U.S. dollar-denominated. For a discussion of foreign currency risks, see the Foreign Currency Exchange Risk section of this MD&A.

The Company also has exposure to commercial mortgage loans. These loans are collateralized by real estate properties that are diversified both geographically throughout the United States and by property type. These commercial loans are originated by the Company as high quality whole loans, and the Company may sell

participation interests in one or more loans to third parties. A loan participation interest represents a pro-rata share in interest and principal payments generated by the participated loan, and the relationship between the Company as loan originator, lead participant and servicer and the third party as a participant are

governed by a participation agreement.
As of December 31, 2019, commercial mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $4.2 billion and carrying value of $4.2 billion, with no valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2018, commercial mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $3.7 billion and carrying value of $3.7 billion with a valuation allowance of $1.
The Company funded $840 of commercial mortgage loans with a weighted average loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of 59% and a weighted average yield of 3.6% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The Company continues to originate

commercial loans within primary markets, such as office, industrial and multi-family, focusing on loans with strong LTV ratios and high quality property collateral. There were no mortgage loans held for sale as of December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018.

[2] Leasing revenue bonds are generally the obligations of a financing authority established by the municipality that leases facilities back to a municipality. The notes are typically secured by lease payments made by the municipality that is leasing the facilities financed by the issue. Lease payments may be subject to annual appropriation by the municipality or the municipality may be obligated to appropriate general tax revenues to make lease payments.

As of both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the largest issuer concentrations were the New York Dormitory Authority, the New York City Transitional Finance Authority, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which each comprised less than 3% of the municipal bond portfolio and were primarily comprised of general obligation and revenue bonds. In total, municipal bonds make up 18% of the fair value of the Company's investment portfolio. In light of changes in corporate income tax rates that began in 2018, the Company has reduced its exposure to municipal bonds through maturities, asset sales and principal repayments.
Limited Partnerships and Other Alternative Investments
The following table presents the Company’s investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments which

include hedge funds, real estate funds and private equity funds. Real estate funds consist of investments primarily in real estate joint ventures and, to a lesser extent, equity funds. Private equity funds primarily consist of investments in funds whose assets typically consist of a diversified pool of investments in small to mid-sized non-public businesses with high growth potential as well as limited exposure to public markets.

Available-for-sale Securities — Unrealized Loss Aging
The total gross unrealized losses were $55 as of December 31, 2019, and have decreased $599 from December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. As of December 31, 2019, $50 of the gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The remaining $5 of gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed greater than 20%. The securities depressed more than 20% are primarily related to commercial real estate securities that were purchased at tighter credit spreads.
As part of the Company’s ongoing security monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its AFS securities in an unrealized loss

position and concluded that these securities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the securities approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these securities in an unrealized loss position where a credit impairment has not been recorded, the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities.

- -------------------------
• $235 of interest on debt.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• $465 of common stockholders' dividends, subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and before share repurchases.

Equity repurchase program:
Authorization for equity repurchases of up to $1.0 billion effective through December 31, 2020. Under the program the company repurchased 3.4 million shares during the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 for $200 with $800 of authorization remaining as of December 31, 2019.

Liquidity Requirements and Sources of Capital
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("HFSG Holding Company")
The liquidity requirements of the holding company of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. have been and will continue to be met by HFSG Holding Company’s fixed maturities; short-term investments and cash; dividends, principally from its subsidiaries; and tax receipts, including realization of net operating losses and refunds of prior period AMT credits available to the HFSG Holding Company. In addition, HFSG Holding Company can meet its liquidity requirements through the issuance of common stock, debt or other capital securities and borrowings from its credit facilities, as needed.
During the second half of 2019, approximately $115 of capital was contributed by HFSG Holding Company to its Lloyd's corporate member and an additional contribution of approximately $30 is expected to be made in March 2020.  It is expected that the amount of letters of credit under the Lloyd’s Letter of Credit Facility permitted to support Lloyd's capital requirements will be reduced by the end of 2020, which will require the Company to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd's, including utilizing HFSG Holding Company resources.
Debt
On January 15, 2019, The Hartford repaid at maturity the $413 principal amount of its 6.0% senior notes.
In the Navigators Group acquisition, the Company assumed $265 par value 5.75% senior notes due on October 15, 2023 with a fair value of $284 as of the acquisition date.

On August 19, 2019, The Hartford issued $600 of 2.8% senior notes (“2.8% Notes”) due August 19, 2029 and $800 of 3.6% senior notes (“3.6% Notes”) due August 19, 2049 for net proceeds of approximately $1.38 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses. Under both senior note issuances, interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on August 19 and February 19, commencing February 19, 2020.
After receiving proceeds from the issuance of the 2.8% Notes and 3.6% Notes, in third quarter 2019, The Hartford repaid $265 of 5.75% senior notes due 2023 that had been assumed in the Navigators Group acquisition and $800 of 5.125% senior notes due 2022 of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $90 before tax. The balance of the proceeds was used for general corporate purposes.
For additional information on Debt, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Equity
Under a $1.0 billion share repurchase authorization by the Board of Directors in February, 2019, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 3.4 million common shares for $200. During the period from January 1, 2020 to February 19, 2020, the Company repurchased approximately 1.4 million common shares for $82 under this authorization.  Any repurchase of shares under the equity repurchase program is dependent on market conditions and other factors.
For further information about equity repurchases, see Part II - Item 5. Market for The Hartford's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.
In 2018, the Company issued preferred stock and used the net proceeds from the offering to help fund repayment of the Company's 6.000% Senior Notes due January 15, 2019.
For further information regarding Preferred Stock, see Note 15 - Equity of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Dividends
The Hartford's Board of Directors declared the following quarterly dividends since October 1, 2019:

There are no current restrictions on HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders.
For a discussion of restrictions on dividends to HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries, see "Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries" below. For a discussion of potential

limitations on the HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends, see Part I, Item 1A, — Risk Factors for the risk factor "Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations".

Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits
While the Company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, minimum contributions are mandated in certain circumstances pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21) and Internal Revenue Code regulations. The Company made contributions to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately $70, $101 and $280 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No contributions were made to the other postretirement plans in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The Company’s 2019, 2018 and 2017 required minimum funding contributions were immaterial. The Company does not have a 2020 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and the funding requirements for all pension plans are expected to be immaterial. The Company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2020. The Company will monitor the funded status of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2020 to make this determination.
Beginning in 2017, the Company began to use a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and non-qualified pension plans and the postretirement benefit plan. The full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that are used in its determination of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. The change was made to provide a better estimate of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by better aligning projected benefit cash flows with corresponding spot rates on the yield curve rather than using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve as had been done historically.
The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, and accordingly, recognized the effect prospectively beginning in 2017. For further discussion on full yield curve approach, see Part 2, Item 7, MD&A - Pension Plans and Other Postretirement in The Hartford’s 2018 Form 10-K Annual Report.
On June 30, 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract to transfer approximately $1.6 billion of the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligations related to certain U.S. retirees, terminated vested participants, and beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, in the second quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750 ($488 net of tax) and a reduction to stockholders' equity of $144.
In connection with this transaction, the Company made a contribution of $280 in September 2017 to the U.S. qualified pension plan in order to maintain the plan’s pre-transaction funded status.

Dividends from Subsidiaries
Dividends to HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. Upon the acquisition of Navigators Group, the Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium.
The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles. In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner.
Property casualty insurers domiciled in New York, including Navigators Insurance Company ("NIC") and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company ("NSIC"), generally may not, without notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner, pay dividends out of earned surplus in any twelve‑month period that exceeds the lesser of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the most recent financial statement on file, or (ii) 100% of its adjusted net investment income, as defined, for the same twelve month period. As part of the New York state insurance commissioner's approval of the Navigators Group acquisition, and as is common practice, any dividend from NIC and NSIC before May 2021 will require prior approval from the state insurance commissioner.
The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiaries, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.
Corporate members of Lloyd's Syndicates may pay dividends to its parent to the extent of available profits that have been distributed from the syndicate in excess of the Funds at Lloyd's ("FAL") capital requirement. The FAL is determined based on the syndicate’s solvency capital requirement under the E.U.'s Solvency II capital adequacy model, plus a Lloyd’s specific economic capital assessment.
Insurers domiciled in the United Kingdom may pay dividends to its parent out of its statutory profits subject to restrictions imposed under U.K. Company law and European Insurance regulation (Solvency II). Belgium domiciled insurers may only pay dividends if, at the end of its previous fiscal year, the total amount of its assets, as reduced by its provisions and debts, are in excess of certain minimum capital thresholds calculated under Belgian law.

102

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

In 2019, HFSG Holding Company received $300 of dividends from HLA, $116 from Hartford Funds and $3 from a run-off HFSG subsidiary. In addition, HFSG Holding Company received $50 of ordinary P&C dividends that were subsequently contributed to a run-off P&C subsidiary. Excluding the dividends that were subsequently contributed to a P&C subsidiary, there were no net dividends paid by P&C subsidiaries to HFSG Holding Company in 2019.

Other Sources of Capital for the HFSG Holding Company
The Hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries, ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace (see the "Ratings" section below for further discussion), and stockholder returns. As a result, the Company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of debt, common equity, preferred stock, equity-related debt or other capital securities and is continuously evaluating strategic opportunities. The issuance of debt, common equity, equity-related debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of stockholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense.
Shelf Registrations
The Hartford filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("the SEC") on May 17, 2019 that permits it to offer and sell debt and equity securities during the three-year life of the registration statement.
For further information regarding Shelf Registrations, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Revolving Credit Facilities
The Company has a senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") that provides up to $750 million of unsecured credit through March 29, 2023. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding and $5 in letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.
Commercial Paper
As of December 31, 2019, The Hartford's maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program is $750 and there was no commercial paper outstanding.
Intercompany Liquidity Agreements
The Company has $2.0 billion available under an intercompany liquidity agreement that allows for short-term advances of funds among HFSG Holding Company and certain affiliates of up to $2.0 billion for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Connecticut Department of Insurance ("CTDOI") granted approval for certain affiliated insurance companies that are parties to the agreement to treat receivables from a parent, including HFSG Holding Company, as admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes.
As of December 31, 2019, there were no amounts outstanding at HFSG Holding Company.
Collateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
The Company’s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”) and HLA, are members of the Federal Home

Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”). Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short- or long-term with fixed or variable rates. Advances may be used to support general corporate purposes, which would be presented as short- or long-term debt, or to earn incremental investment income, which would be presented in other liabilities consistent with other collateralized financing transactions. As of December 31, 2019, there were no advances outstanding.
For further information regarding the Company's ability to access collateralized advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Lloyd's Letter of Credit Facilities
As a result of the acquisition of Navigators Group, The Hartford has two letter of credit facility agreements: the Club Facility and the Bilateral Facility, which are used to provide a portion of the capital requirements at Lloyd's. As of December 31, 2019, uncollateralized letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $165 and £60 million were outstanding under the Club Facility and £18 million was outstanding under the Bilateral Facility. As of December 31, 2019, the Bilateral Facility has unused capacity of $1 for issuance of additional letters of credit. Among other covenants, the Club Facility and Bilateral Facility contain financial covenants regarding tangible net worth and FAL. As of December 31, 2019, Navigators Group was in compliance with all financial covenants. In November of 2019, the Company issued £11 million of letters of credit under the Bilateral Facility.

Derivative Commitments
Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2019 was $81. For this $81, the legal entities have posted collateral of $77, in the normal course of business. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2019, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2019, a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would require an additional $5 of assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the additional collateral that we would post, if required,

103

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

would be primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.
As of December 31, 2019, no derivative positions would be subject to immediate termination in the event of a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings. This could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.

Insurance Operations
While subject to variability period to period, underwriting and investment cash flows continue to be within historical norms and, therefore, the Company’s insurance operations’ current liquidity position is considered to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months. For a discussion and tabular presentation of the Company’s current contractual obligations by period, refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations within the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A.
The principal sources of operating funds are premiums, fees earned from assets under management and investment income, while investing cash flows primarily originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, claim adjustment expenses, commissions and other underwriting and insurance operating costs, to pay taxes, to purchase new investments and to make dividend payments to the HFSG Holding Company.
The Company’s insurance operations consist of property and casualty insurance products (collectively referred to as “Property & Casualty Operations”) and Group Benefits.
The Company's insurance operations hold fixed maturity securities including a significant short-term investment position (securities with maturities of one year or less at the time of purchase) to meet liquidity needs. Liquidity requirements that are unable to be funded by the Company's insurance operations' short-term investments would be satisfied with current operating funds, including premiums or investing cash flows, which includes proceeds received through the sale of invested assets. A sale of invested assets could result in significant realized capital losses.
The following tables represent the fixed maturity holdings, including the aforementioned cash and short-term investments

available to meet liquidity needs, for each of the Company’s insurance operations.

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations
The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources of the Company, except for unfunded commitments to purchase investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, private placements, and mortgage loans as disclosed in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] The following points are significant to understanding the cash flows estimated for obligations (gross of reinsurance) under property and casualty contracts:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Reserves for Property & Casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses include IBNR and case reserves. While payments due on claim reserves are considered contractual obligations because they relate to insurance policies issued by the Company, the ultimate amount to be paid to settle both case reserves and IBNR is an estimate, subject to significant uncertainty. The actual amount to be paid is not finally determined until the Company reaches a settlement with the claimant. Final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates, particularly since many claims will not be settled until well into the future.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• In estimating the timing of future payments by year, the Company has assumed that its historical payment patterns will continue. However, the actual timing of future payments could vary materially from these estimates due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements. In particular, there is significant uncertainty over the claim payment patterns of asbestos and environmental claims. In addition, the table does not include future cash flows related to the receipt of premiums that may be used, in part, to fund loss payments.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Under U.S. GAAP, the Company is only permitted to discount reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in cases where the payment pattern and ultimate loss costs are fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. For the Company, these include claim settlements with permanently disabled claimants. As of December 31, 2019, the total property and casualty reserves in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $388.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amounts shown do not consider $5.3 billion of reinsurance and other recoverables the Company expects to collect related to property and casualty obligations.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] Estimated group life and disability obligations are based on assumptions comparable with the Company’s historical experience, modified for recent observed trends. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results. As of December 31, 2019, the total group life and disability obligations in the above table are gross of a reserve discount of $1.4 billion.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3] Includes undiscounted lease payments on operating lease agreements, including leases that have not yet commenced. See Note 20 - Leases of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on lease commitments.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4] Includes contractual principal and interest payments. See Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5] Includes $1.3 billion in commitments to purchase investments including approximately $852 of limited partnership and other alternative investments, $191 of private debt and equity securities, and $215 of mortgage loans. Of the $1.3 billion in commitments to purchase investments, $130 are related to mortgage loan commitments which the Company can cancel unconditionally. Outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be reliably estimated. The remaining commitments to purchase investments primarily represent payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Also included in purchase obligations is $581 relating to contractual commitments to purchase various goods and services such as maintenance, human resources, and information technology in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations exclude contracts that are cancelable without penalty or contracts that do not specify minimum levels of goods or services to be purchased.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6] Includes cash collateral of $16 which the Company has accepted in connection with the Company’s derivative instruments. Since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year.

Cash Flow [1]

----------------------------------------- ---- ------ ---- - ------ - - ------ -

 2019 2018 2017
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,489 $ 2,843 $ 2,186
Net cash used for investing activities $ (2,148 ) $ (1,962 ) $ (1,442 )
Net cash used for financing activities $ (1,191 ) $ (1,467 ) $ (979 )
Cash and restricted cash— end of year $ 262 $ 121 $ 180

[1] Cash activities in 2018 and 2017 include cash flows from Discontinued Operations; see Note 21 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on cash flows from Discontinued Operations.

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2019 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in premiums received in excess of losses and expenses paid, including the effect of the Navigators Group acquisition, and an AMT refund of $421, partially offset by the fact that the 2018 period included operating cash flows of the life and annuity business sold in 2018.
Net cash used for investing activities increased primarily due to a change from net proceeds to net payments for fixed maturities in the 2019 period, as well as cash paid for the acquisition of Navigators Group of $1.9 billion (net of cash acquired), partially offset by net proceeds from short term investments, equity securities at fair value and derivatives in 2019 as opposed to net payments in the 2018 period. Further contributing to the increase in net cash used from investing activities were proceeds in 2018 from the sale of the life and annuity business.
Net cash used for financing activities decreased from the 2018 period primarily due to a decrease in cash used for net securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt in 2019, an increase in treasury stock acquired in 2019, and a decrease in net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investments and universal life products due to the sale of the life and annuity business in 2018.
Operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements.

Equity Markets
For a discussion of the potential impact of the equity markets on capital and liquidity, see the Financial Risk on Statutory Capital and Liquidity Risk section in this MD&A.

Ratings
Ratings are an important factor in establishing a competitive position in the insurance marketplace and impact the Company's ability to access financing and its cost of borrowing. There can be no assurance that the Company’s ratings will continue for any

given period of time, or that they will not be changed. In the event the Company’s ratings are downgraded, the Company’s competitive position, ability to access financing, and its cost of borrowing, may be adversely impacted.
On April 15, 2019, Standards & Poor's ("S&P") raised its issuer credit and financial strength ratings on HLA to A+ from A. The upgrade of HLA's ratings reflects S&P's improved view of the Company's group benefits business, which they consider core to the Company, under their group rating methodology criteria.
On August 30, 2019, AM Best raised its financial strength rating on Navigators Insurance Company ("NIC") to A+ from A. The upgrade reflects the support provided by The Hartford, as well as the importance it will play within the overall Hartford organization, following its acquisition in May 2019.
Insurance Financial Strength Ratings as of February 19, 2020

These ratings are not a recommendation to buy or hold any of The Hartford’s securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.
The agencies consider many factors in determining the final rating of an insurance company. One consideration is the relative level of statutory capital and surplus (referred to collectively as "statutory capital") necessary to support the business written and is reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors — “Downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings may make our products less attractive, increase our cost of capital and inhibit our ability to refinance our debt.”

U.S. Statutory Capital Rollforward for the Company's Insurance Subsidiaries

[1] The statutory capital for property and casualty insurance subsidiaries in this table does not include the value of an intercompany note owed by Hartford Holdings, Inc. ("HHI") to Hartford Fire Insurance Company. Excluding the dividends that were subsequently contributed to a P&C subsidiary, there were no net dividends paid by P&C subsidiaries to HFSG Holding Company in 2019.

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] Excludes insurance operations in the U.K. and continental Europe. Though the business was not acquired until May 23, 2019, this table includes statutory capital and surplus of Navigators U.S. insurance subsidiaries as of both January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019.

Stat to GAAP Differences
Significant differences between U.S. GAAP stockholders’ equity and aggregate statutory capital prepared in accordance with U.S. STAT include the following:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• U.S. STAT excludes equity of non-insurance and foreign insurance subsidiaries not held by U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Costs incurred by the Company to acquire insurance policies are deferred under U.S. GAAP while those costs are expensed immediately under U.S. STAT.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Temporary differences between the book and tax basis of an asset or liability which are recorded as deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability under U.S. GAAP while these amounts are then subject to further admissibility tests under U.S. STAT.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The assumptions used in the determination of Group Benefits reserves (i.e. for Group Benefits contracts) are prescribed under U.S. STAT, while the assumptions used under U.S. GAAP are generally the Company’s best estimates.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• The difference between the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity and other investments, net of tax, is recorded as an increase or decrease to the carrying value of the related asset and to equity under U.S. GAAP, while U.S. STAT only records certain securities at fair value, such as equity securities and certain lower rated bonds required by the NAIC to be recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• U.S. STAT for life insurance companies like HLA establishes a formula reserve for realized and unrealized losses due to default and equity risks associated with certain invested assets (the Asset Valuation Reserve), while U.S. GAAP does not. Also, for those realized gains and losses caused by changes in interest rates, U.S. STAT for life insurance companies defers and amortizes the gains and losses, caused by changes in interest rates, into income over the original life to maturity of the asset sold (the Interest Maintenance Reserve) while U.S. GAAP does not.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Goodwill arising from the acquisition of a business is tested for recoverability on an annual basis (or more frequently, as necessary) for U.S. GAAP, while under U.S. STAT goodwill is amortized over a period not to exceed 10 years and the amount of goodwill admitted as an asset is limited.

In addition, certain assets, including a portion of premiums receivable and fixed assets, are non-admitted (recorded at zero value and charged against surplus) under U.S. STAT. U.S. GAAP generally evaluates assets based on their recoverability.

Risk-Based Capital
The Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose RBC requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's U.S. operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.
Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators, regulatory authorities in the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates generally establish minimum solvency requirements for insurance companies. All of the Company's international insurance subsidiaries have capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.

Sensitivity
In any particular year, statutory capital amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending upon a variety of factors. The amount of change in the statutory capital or RBC ratios can vary based on individual factors and may be compounded in extreme scenarios or if multiple factors occur at the same time. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. For further discussion on these factors, see MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management, Financial Risk on Statutory Capital.
Statutory capital at the insurance subsidiaries has been

107

Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

maintained at capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from rating agencies. Statutory capital generated by the insurance subsidiaries in excess of the capital level required to meet desired ratings is available for use by the enterprise or for corporate purposes. The amount of statutory capital can increase or decrease depending on a number of factors affecting insurance results including, among other factors, the level of catastrophe claims incurred, the amount of reserve development, the effect of changes in interest rates on investment income and the discounting of loss reserves, and the effect of realized gains and losses on investments.

Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
For a discussion regarding contingencies related to The Hartford’s legal proceedings, please see the information contained under “Litigation” and “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” in Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Legislative and Regulatory Developments
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the "Affordable Care Act") It is unclear whether the Administration, Congress or the courts will seek to reverse, amend or alter the ongoing operation of the Affordable Care Act ("ACA"). If such actions were to occur, they may have an impact on various aspects of our business, including our insurance businesses. It is unclear what an amended ACA would entail, and to what extent there may be a transition period for the phase out of the ACA. The impact to The Hartford as an employer would be consistent with other large employers. The Hartford’s core business does not involve the issuance of health insurance, and we have not observed any material impacts on the Company’s workers’ compensation business or group benefits business from the enactment of the ACA. We will continue to monitor the impact of the ACA and any reforms on consumer, broker and medical provider behavior for leading indicators of changes in medical costs or loss payments primarily on the Company's workers' compensation and disability liabilities.
Tax Reform At the end of 2017, Congress passed and the president signed, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform"), which enacted significant reforms to the U.S. tax code. The major areas of interest to the company included the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and the refunding of AMT credits. The U.S. Treasury and IRS continue to develop guidance implementing Tax Reform, and Congress may consider additional technical corrections to the law. Tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by Congress and/or the U.S. Treasury Department could have a material effect on the Company and its insurance businesses. The nature and timing of any Congressional or regulatory action with respect to any such efforts is unclear. For additional information on risks to the Company related to Tax Reform, please see the risk factor entitled "Changes in federal or state tax laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity" under "Risk Factors" in Part I.

Part II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
The Company's principal executive officer and its principal financial officer, based on their evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective for the purposes set forth in the definition thereof in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of December 31, 2019.
On May 23, 2019 we acquired Navigators Group. SEC guidance permits management to omit an assessment of an acquired business from management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of the acquisition. Accordingly, we have not yet included Navigators Group in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Navigators Group accounted for 5% of our total net revenue, and as of December 31, 2019 represented 10% of total assets.
Management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting
The management of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“The Hartford”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for The Hartford as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate

because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Hartford's management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment under those criteria, The Hartford's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
As described above, our management excluded an assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting of Navigators Group from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. The Company has begun integrating Navigators Group into its existing control procedures, which may lead us to modify certain internal controls in future periods.
Attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm
The Hartford's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting which is set forth below.

Part II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hartford, Connecticut
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of Navigators Group, which was acquired on May 23, 2019, and whose financial statements constitute 10% of total assets and 5% of total net revenues of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at the acquired business.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Certain of the information called for by Item 12 will be set forth in the Proxy Statement under the caption “Information on Stock Ownership” and is incorporated herein by reference.
Equity Compensation Plan Information
The following table provides information as of December 31, 2019 about the securities authorized for issuance under the Company’s equity compensation plans. The Company maintains The Hartford 2005 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”), The Hartford 2010 Incentive Stock Plan (the “2010 Stock Plan”), The Hartford 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the "2014 Stock Plan") (collectively the "Stock Plans") and The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”). On May 21, 2014, the stockholders of

the Company approved the 2014 Stock Plan, which superseded the earlier plans. Pursuant to the provisions of the 2014 Stock Plan, no additional shares may be issued from the 2010 Stock Plan. To the extent that any awards under the 2005 Stock Plan and the 2010 Stock Plan are forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expire unexercised or are settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number of shares subject to the award, the shares subject to such awards (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for award under the 2014 Stock Plan and such shares shall be added to the total number of shares available under the 2014 Stock Plan. For a description of the 2014 Stock Plan and the ESPP, see Note 19 - Stock Compensation Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

[1] The amount shown in this column includes 5,846,481 outstanding options awarded under the 2005 Stock Plan and the 2010 Stock Plan. The amount shown in this column includes 3,608,257 outstanding restricted stock units and 759,595 outstanding performance shares at 100% of target (which excludes 391,492 shares that vested on December 31, 2019, related to the 2017-2019 performance period) as of December 31, 2019 under the 2010 Stock Plan and the 2014 Stock Plan. The maximum number of performance shares that could be awarded is 1,519,190 (200% of target) if the Company achieved the highest performance level. Under the 2010 and 2014 Stock Plans, no more than 500,000 shares in the aggregate can be earned by an individual employee with respect to restricted stock unit and performance share awards made in a single calendar year. As a result, the number of shares ultimately distributed to an employee with respect to awards made in the same year will be reduced, if necessary, so that the number does not exceed this limit.

[2] The weighted-average exercise price reflects outstanding options and does not reflect outstanding restricted stock units or performance shares because they do not have exercise prices.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.
Hartford, Connecticut
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex audit judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Refer to Notes 1 and 11 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
For property and casualty and group life and disability insurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not reported, and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors.
Given the subjectivity of estimating the ultimate cost to settle the liabilities for reported and unreported claims due to uncertainties caused by various factors including frequency and severity of claims as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2019, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses included the following, among others:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company's estimation processes.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the Company’s analysis, including historical claims.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses by:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Comparing the Company’s prior year assumptions of expected development of ultimate loss to actual losses incurred during the current year to identify potential management bias in the determination of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Assessing the reasonableness of the Company’s analysis, and for selected reserving lines, developing independent estimates of the unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and comparing such estimates to the Company’s estimates.

Navigators Group Acquisition Identifiable Intangible Assets - Refer to Note 2 of the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company completed the acquisition of Navigators Group for $2.1 billion on May 23, 2019. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identifiable intangible assets of $580 million. The fair value determination of the identifiable intangible assets required the Company to make estimates and assumptions, including expected new business, premium retention rates, investment returns, claim costs, and expenses, related to future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired business and the selection of an appropriate discount rate.
Given the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets for the Navigators Group acquisition required management to make estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future cash flows and the selection of the discount rate, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future cash flows and the selection of the discount rate for the identifiable intangible assets included the following, among others:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets, including the Company’s controls over forecasts of future cash flows and selection of an appropriate discount rate.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We assessed the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasts of future cash flows by comparing the projections to historical results and certain peer companies.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate by:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Developing a range of independent discount rates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by the Company.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We evaluated whether the estimated future cash flows were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Investments in Fixed Maturities Classified as Available-for-Sale - Refer to Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value in the financial statements. The investments without readily determinable fair values were valued using significant unobservable inputs, such as credit spreads and interest rates beyond the observable curve, that involved considerable judgment by the Company.
Given the Company used models and unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, performing audit procedures to evaluate these inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the models and unobservable inputs used by the Company to estimate the fair value of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale included the following, among others:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of investments in fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale, including controls over inputs, methods, and assumptions used in the Company’s estimation processes.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• On a sample basis, we tested the accuracy and completeness of the investments owned as of December 31, 2019, and the relevant

security attributes used in the determination of their fair values.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, for a sample of investments, we tested the mathematical accuracy of the fair value calculation and developed independent estimates of the fair value and compared our estimates to the Company’s estimates. In addition to developing independent estimates, we obtained an understanding of the models and inputs used by the Company and assessed those models and inputs for reasonableness. Such assessment included comparing inputs to external sources or developing independent inputs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollar amounts in millions, except for per share data, unless otherwise stated)

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a holding company for insurance and financial services subsidiaries that provide property and casualty insurance, group life and disability products and mutual funds and exchange-traded products to individual and business customers (collectively, “The Hartford”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”).
On May 23, 2019, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of The Navigators Group, Inc. ("Navigators Group"), a global specialty underwriter, for $70 a share, or $2.137 billion in cash, including transaction expenses.
On May 31, 2018, Hartford Holdings, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the sale of the issued and outstanding equity of Hartford Life, Inc. (“HLI”), a holding company, for its life and annuity operating subsidiaries.
On November 1, 2017, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company ("HLA"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the acquisition of Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business through a reinsurance transaction.
On May 10, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its United Kingdom ("U.K.") property and casualty run-off subsidiaries.
For further discussion of these transactions, see Note 2 - Business Acquisitions and Note 21 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) which differ materially from the accounting practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory authorities.
Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest. Entities in which the Company has significant influence over the operating and financing decisions but does not control are reported using the equity method. All intercompany transactions and balances between The Hartford and its subsidiaries and affiliates that are not held for sale have been eliminated.
Discontinued Operations
The results of operations of a component of the Company are reported in discontinued operations when certain criteria are met as of the date of disposal, or earlier if classified as held-for-sale. When a component is identified for discontinued operations reporting, amounts for prior periods are retrospectively reclassified as discontinued operations. Components are identified as discontinued operations if they are a major part of an entity's operations and financial results such as a separate major line of business or a separate major geographical area of operations.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The most significant estimates include those used in determining property and casualty and group long-term disability insurance product reserves, net of reinsurance; evaluation of goodwill for impairment; valuation of investments and derivative instruments; valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; and contingencies relating to corporate litigation and regulatory matters.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to conform to the current year presentation. In particular, the restricted cash has been reclassified out of cash to a separate line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Reclassification of Effect of Tax Rate Change from AOCI to Retained Earnings
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB") new guidance for the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to items recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform") enacted on December 22, 2017. Tax Reform reduced the federal tax rate applied to the Company’s deferred tax balances from 35% to 21% on enactment. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company recorded the total effect of the change in enacted tax rates on deferred tax balances as a charge to income tax expense within net income during the fourth quarter of 2017, including the change in deferred tax balances related to components of AOCI. The new accounting guidance permitted the Company to reclassify the “stranded” tax effects out of AOCI and into retained earnings that resulted from recording the tax effects of unrealized investment gains, unrecognized actuarial losses on pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and cumulative translation adjustments at a 35% tax rate because the 14 point reduction in tax rate was recognized in net income instead of other comprehensive income. On adoption, the Company recorded a reclassification of $88 from AOCI to retained earnings. As a result of the reclassification, in the first quarter of 2018, the Company reduced the estimated loss on sale recorded in income from discontinued operations by $193, net of tax, for the increase in AOCI related to the assets held for sale. The reduction in the loss on sale resulted in a corresponding increase

in assets held for sale and AOCI as of January 1, 2018 and the AOCI associated with assets held for sale was removed from the balance sheet when the sale closed on May 31, 2018. Additionally, as of January 1, 2018, the Company reclassified $105 of stranded tax effects related to continuing operations which reduced AOCI and increased retained earnings.
Financial Instruments- Recognition and Measurement
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted updated guidance issued by the FASB for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments through a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balances of retained earnings and AOCI. The new guidance requires investments in equity securities to be measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income except for investments that are consolidated or are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The new guidance also requires a deferred tax asset resulting from net unrealized losses on fixed maturities, available-for-sale that are recognized in AOCI to be evaluated for recoverability in combination with the Company’s other deferred tax assets. Under prior guidance, the Company reported equity securities, available-for-sale ("AFS"), at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income. As of January 1, 2018, the Company reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings net unrealized gains of $83, after tax, related to equity securities having a fair value of $1.0 billion. In addition, $10 of net unrealized gains net of shadow DAC related to discontinued operations were reclassified from AOCI to retained earnings of the life and annuity business held for sale, which increased the estimated loss on sale in 2018 by the same amount. Beginning in 2018, the Company reports equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and losses.
Revenue Recognition
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the FASB’s updated guidance for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers, which excludes insurance contracts and financial instruments. Revenue subject to the guidance is recognized when, or as, goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity is expected to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For all but certain revenues associated with our Hartford Funds business, the updated guidance is consistent with previous guidance for the Company’s transactions and did not have an effect on the Company’s financial position, cash flows or net income. The updated guidance also updated criteria for determining when the Company acts as a principal or an agent. The Company determined that it is the principal for some of its mutual fund distribution service contracts and, upon adoption, reclassified distribution costs of $188 for the year ended December 31, 2017, that were previously netted against fee income to insurance operating costs and other expenses.
Qualitative information about the nature, timing of recognition and cash flows for the Company’s revenues subject to the updated guidance is disclosed below under Significant Accounting Policies-Revenue Recognition and quantitative information is disclosed in Note 4 - Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Hedging Activities
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB's updated guidance for hedge accounting through a cumulative effect adjustment of less than $1 to reclassify cumulative ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges from retained earnings to AOCI. The updates allow hedge accounting for new types of interest rate hedges of financial instruments and simplify documentation requirements to qualify for hedge accounting. In addition, any gain or loss from hedge ineffectiveness is reported in the same income statement line with the effective hedge results and the hedged transaction. For cash flow hedges, the ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings only when the hedged transaction affects earnings; otherwise, the ineffectiveness gains or losses remain in AOCI. Under previous accounting, total hedge ineffectiveness was reported separately in realized capital gains and losses apart from the hedged transaction. The adoption did not affect the Company’s financial position or cash flows or have a material effect on net income.
Leases
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB’s updated lease guidance. Under the updated guidance, lessees with operating leases are required to recognize a liability for the present value of future minimum lease payments with a corresponding asset for the right of use of the property. Prior to the new guidance, future minimum lease payments on operating leases were commitments that were not recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. Leases are classified as financing or operating leases. Where the lease is economically similar to a purchase because The Hartford obtains control of the underlying asset, the lease is classified as a financing lease and the Company recognizes amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense on the liability. Where the lease provides The Hartford with only the right to control the use of the underlying asset over the lease term and the lease term is greater than one year, the lease is an operating lease and the lease cost is recognized as rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a term of one year or less are also expensed over the lease term but not recognized on the balance sheet. On adoption, The Hartford recorded a lease payment obligation of $160 for outstanding leases and a right of use asset of $150, which is net of $10 in lease incentives received, with no change to comparative periods. As permitted by the new guidance, as of the implementation date, the Company did not reassess whether expired or existing contracts are leases or contain leases, did not change the classification of expired or existing operating leases, and did not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases to determine if deferred costs should be written-off or recorded on adoption. The adoption did not impact net income or cash flows.
Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Goodwill
The FASB issued updated guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The updated guidance requires recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment based on the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit compared to its estimated fair value, with the amount of the impairment not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Under existing guidance, if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company allocates the fair value of the

F-11

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. An impairment loss is then recognized for the excess, if any, of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill compared to the implied goodwill value. The Company will adopt the updated guidance January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis as required. The Company would not have recognized a goodwill impairment loss for the years presented had the updated guidance been in effect. Since the estimated fair value of the reporting unit will no longer be allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value, under the updated guidance changes in market-based factors are more likely to result in a goodwill impairment, whether a reporting unit's fair value is estimated using an income approach or a market approach. For example, changes in the weighted average cost of capital that is used to discount expected cash flows under the income approach or changes in market-based factors such as peer company price to earnings multiples or price to book multiples under a market approach can significantly affect changes to the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and such changes could result in impairments that have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
The FASB issued updated guidance for recognition and measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance will replace the “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for recognizing credit losses for financial instruments carried at other than fair value. Under the new model, an allowance for credit losses ("ACL") will be recorded based on an estimate of credit losses expected over the life of financial instruments carried at other than fair value, such as mortgage loans, reinsurance recoverables and receivables. Under the current accounting model an ACL is recognized using an incurred loss approach. The new guidance also requires that we estimate a liability for credit losses ("LCL") on off-balance-sheet credit exposures such as financial guarantees and mortgage loan commitments that the Company cannot unconditionally cancel. Credit losses on fixed maturities AFS carried at fair value will continue to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows; however, the losses will be recognized through an ACL and no longer as an adjustment to the amortized cost. Recoveries of impairments on fixed maturities AFS will be recognized as reversals of the ACL and no longer accreted as investment income through an adjustment to the investment yield. The ACL on fixed maturities AFS cannot cause the net carrying value to be below fair value and, therefore, it is possible that future increases in fair value due to decreases in market interest rates could cause the reversal of a valuation allowance and increase net income. The new guidance also requires purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since original issuance to be recorded based on contractual amounts due with an initial allowance recorded at the date of purchase.
The Company will adopt the guidance effective January 1, 2020, through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $18, representing a net increase to the ACL and LCL, after-tax, upon adoption. No ACL will be recognized at adoption for fixed maturities, AFS; rather, these investments will be evaluated for an ACL prospectively.
Reserve for Future Policy Benefits
The FASB issued new guidance on accounting for long-duration insurance contracts. The Company’s long-duration insurance

contracts include paid-up life insurance and whole-life insurance policies resulting from conversion from group life policies and run-off structured settlement and terminal funding agreement liabilities with total future policy benefit reserves of $635 as of December 31, 2019. Under existing guidance, a reserve for future policy benefits is calculated as the present value of future benefits and related expenses less the present value of any future premiums using assumptions “locked in” at the time the policies were issued, including discount rate, lapse rate, mortality, and expense assumptions. Under existing guidance, assumptions are only updated if there is an expected premium deficiency. The new guidance will require that underlying cash flow assumptions (such as for lapse rate, mortality and expenses) be reviewed and updated at least annually in the same quarter each year. The new guidance also requires that the discount rate assumption be updated each quarter and be based on an upper-medium grade (low-credit-risk) fixed-income investment yield. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating cash flow assumptions will be recognized in net income. The change in the reserve estimate as a result of updating the discount rate assumption will be recognized in other comprehensive income. Because reserves will be based on updated assumptions and no longer locked in at contract inception, there will no longer be a test for premium deficiency. The new guidance will be effective January 1, 2022, and will be applied to balances in place as of the earliest period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet determined the method or timing for adoption or estimated the effect on the Company’s financial statements.
Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s significant accounting policies are as follows:
Revenue Recognition
Premium Revenue from Direct Insurance and Assumed Reinsurance
Property and casualty premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the policy period and include accruals for policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us, as well as ultimate premium revenue anticipated under auditable and retrospectively rated policies. We estimate the amount of premium not yet reported based on current and historical trends of the business being written. Such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year's results. Unearned premiums represent the premiums applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force.
Group life, disability and accident premiums are generally due from policyholders and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the period of the contracts.
An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds, management’s experience and current economic conditions. The Company charges off any balances that are determined to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts included in premiums receivable and agents’ balances in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $145 and $135 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Revenue from Non-Insurance Contracts with Customers
Installment fees are charged on property and casualty insurance contracts for billing the insurance customer in installments over

the policy term. These fees are recognized in fee income as earned on collection.
Insurance servicing revenues within Personal Lines consist of up-front commissions earned for collecting premiums and processing claims on insurance policies for which The Hartford does not assume underwriting risk, predominantly related to the National Flood Insurance Plan program. These insurance servicing revenues are recognized over the period of the flood program's policy terms.
Group Benefits earns fee income from employers for the administration of underwriting, implementation and claims processing for employer self-funded plans and for leave management services. Fees are recognized as services are provided and collected monthly.
Hartford Funds provides investment management, administrative and distribution services to mutual funds and exchange-traded products. The Company assesses investment advisory, distribution and other asset management fees primarily based on the average daily net asset values from mutual funds and exchange-traded products, which are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected monthly. Fluctuations in domestic and international markets and related investment performance, volume and mix of sales and redemptions of mutual funds or exchange-traded products, and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.
Hartford Funds other fees primarily include transfer agent fees, generally assessed as a charge per account, and are recognized as fee income in the period in which the services are provided with payments collected monthly.
Corporate investment management and other fees are primarily for managing third party invested assets, including management of the invested assets of The Hartford’s former life and annuity business. These fees, calculated based on the average quarterly net asset values, are recorded in the period in which the services are provided and are collected quarterly. Fluctuations in markets and interest rates and other changes to the composition of assets under management are all factors that ultimately have a direct effect on fee income earned.
Corporate transition service revenues consist of operational services provided to The Hartford’s former life and annuity business that are provided for a limited period following sale. The transition service revenues are recognized as other revenues in the period in which the services are provided with payments collected monthly.
Dividends to Policyholders
Policyholder dividends are paid to certain property and casualty policyholders. Policies that receive dividends are referred to as participating policies. Participating dividends to policyholders are accrued and reported in insurance operating costs and other expenses and other liabilities using an estimate of the amount to be paid based on underlying contractual obligations under policies and applicable state laws.
Net written premiums for participating property and casualty insurance policies represented 9%, 10% and 10% of total net written premiums for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Participating dividends to property and

casualty policyholders were $30, $23 and $35 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
There were no additional amounts of income allocated to participating policyholders.
Investments
Overview
The Company’s investments in fixed maturities include bonds, structured securities, redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper. Most of these investments are classified as AFS and are carried at fair value. The after tax difference between fair value and cost or amortized cost is reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Effective January 1, 2018, equity securities are measured at fair value with any changes in valuation reported in net income. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Recognition and Measurement discussion above. Fixed maturities for which the Company elected the fair value option are classified as FVO, generally certain securities that contain embedded credit derivatives, and are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in realized capital gains and losses. Mortgage loans are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of valuation allowances. Short-term investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments are reported at their carrying value and are primarily accounted for under the equity method with the Company’s share of earnings included in net investment income. Recognition of income related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments is delayed due to the availability of the related financial information, as private equity and other funds are generally on a three-month delay and hedge funds on a one-month delay. Accordingly, income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 may not include the full impact of current year changes in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities of the funds, which are generally obtained from the limited partnerships. Other investments primarily consist of investments of consolidated investment funds for which the Company has provided seed money and reports the underlying investments at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in income consistent with accounting requirements for investment companies. Also included in Other investments are derivative instruments which are carried at fair value and overseas deposits which are measured at fair value using the net asset value as a practical expedient.
Net Realized Capital Gains and Losses
Net realized capital gains and losses from investment sales are reported as a component of revenues and are determined on a specific identification basis. Net realized capital gains and losses also result from fair value changes in fixed maturities, FVO, equity securities, and derivatives contracts that do not qualify, or are not designated, as a hedge for accounting purposes. Impairments and mortgage loan valuation allowances are recognized as net realized capital losses in accordance with the Company’s impairment and mortgage loan valuation allowance policies as discussed in Note 6 -Investments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company will record changes in the ACL on fixed maturities, AFS as a component of net realized capital gains and losses. For further information, see Financial Instruments - Credit Losses discussion above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Net Investment Income
Interest income from fixed maturities and mortgage loans is recognized when earned on the constant effective yield method based on estimated timing of cash flows. Most premiums and discounts on fixed maturities are amortized to the maturity date. Premiums on callable bonds may be amortized to call dates based on call prices. For securitized financial assets subject to prepayment risk, yields are recalculated and adjusted periodically to reflect historical and/or estimated future prepayments using the retrospective method; however, if these investments are impaired and for certain other asset-backed securities, any yield adjustments are made using the prospective method. Prepayment fees and make-whole payments on fixed maturities and mortgage loans are recorded in net investment income when earned. For equity securities, dividends are recognized as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Limited partnerships and other alternative investments primarily use the equity method of accounting to recognize the Company’s share of earnings. For impaired fixed maturities, the Company accretes the new amortized cost to the estimated future cash flows over the expected remaining life of the investment by prospectively adjusting the effective yield, if necessary. The Company’s non-income producing investments were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company will no longer record impairments for credit losses as adjustments to the amortized cost of the fixed maturity, unless there is an intent to sell before recovery from impairment, but rather will record an ACL. Future changes in the ACL resulting from improvements in expected future cash flows will not be recorded as adjustments to yield through net investment income but will be recorded through net realized capital gains (losses). For fixed maturities with an ACL, net investment income will be recognized at the original effective rate and accretion of the ACL will be recognized through net realized capital gains (losses). For further information, see Financial Instruments - Credit Losses discussion above.
Derivative Instruments
Overview
The Company utilizes a variety of over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, derivatives cleared through central clearing houses ("OTC-cleared") and exchange traded derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions. The types of instruments may include swaps, caps, floors, forwards, futures and options to achieve one of four Company-approved objectives:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• to hedge risk arising from interest rate, equity market, commodity market, credit spread and issuer default, price or currency exchange rates or volatility;

- --------------------
• to manage liquidity;

- -----------------------------
• to control transaction costs;

- -------------------------------------------------
• to enter into synthetic replication transactions.

Interest rate and credit default swaps involve the periodic exchange of cash flows with other parties, at specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates or other financial variables and notional principal amounts. Generally, little to no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract. Typically, at the time a swap is entered into, the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value.

The Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based on daily market value movements. For information on collateral, see the derivative collateral arrangements section in Note 7 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, OTC-cleared transactions include price alignment amounts either received or paid on the variation margin, which are reflected in realized capital gains and losses or, if characterized as interest, in net investment income.
Forward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.
Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts trade on organized exchanges. Margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities or cash, and changes in the futures’ contract values are settled daily in cash.
Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. The contracts may reference commodities, which grant the purchaser the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer commodities at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.
Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.
The Company’s derivative transactions conducted in insurance company subsidiaries are used in strategies permitted under the derivative use plans required by the State of Connecticut, the State of Illinois and the State of New York insurance departments.
Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty or under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset.
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign

F-14

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges - Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings are included in the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Periodic derivative net coupon settlements are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities - The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities primarily relate to strategies used to reduce economic risk or replicate permitted investments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value, including periodic derivative net coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses.
Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing
To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. The documentation process includes linking derivatives that are designated as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and defining the effectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values, cash flows or net investment in foreign operations of hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is assessed primarily using quantitative methods as well as using qualitative methods. Quantitative methods include regression or other statistical analysis of changes in fair value or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item.
Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the derivative continues to be carried at fair value on the

balance sheet with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is no longer adjusted through current period earnings and the existing basis adjustment is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item through the applicable earnings component associated with the hedged item.
When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.
In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.
Embedded Derivatives
The Company purchases investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host for measurement purposes. The embedded derivative, which is reported with the host instrument in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net realized capital gains and losses.
Credit Risk of Derivative Instruments
Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Credit exposures are measured using the market value of the derivatives, resulting in amounts owed to the Company by its counterparties or potential payment obligations from the Company to its counterparties. The Company generally requires that OTC derivative contracts, other than certain forward contracts, be governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current value of the derivatives is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds. The Company also minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better, which are monitored and evaluated by the Company’s risk management team and reviewed by senior management. OTC-cleared derivatives are governed by clearing house rules. Transactions cleared through a central clearing house reduce risk due to their ability to require daily variation margin and act as an independent valuation source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.

Cash and Restricted Cash
Cash represents cash on hand and demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. Restrictions on cash primarily relate to funds that are held to support regulatory and contractual obligations.
Reinsurance
The Company cedes insurance to affiliated and unaffiliated insurers in order to limit its maximum losses and to diversify its exposures and provide statutory surplus relief. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company also assumes reinsurance from other insurers and is a member of and participates in reinsurance pools and associations. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Company’s acceptance of certain insurance risks that other insurance companies or pools have underwritten.
Reinsurance accounting is followed for ceded and assumed transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (i.e. risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must include insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss to the reinsurer. If the ceded and assumed transactions do not meet risk transfer requirements, the Company accounts for these transactions as financing transactions.
Premiums, benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses reflect the net effects of ceded and assumed reinsurance transactions. Included in other assets are prepaid reinsurance premiums, which represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired terms of the reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance recoverables are balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Changes in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reported in benefits, losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and concentrations of credit risk. Reinsurance is placed with reinsurers that meet strict financial criteria established by the Company.
Retroactive reinsurance agreements, including adverse development covers, are reinsurance agreements under which our reinsurer agrees to reimburse us as a result of past insurable events. For these agreements, the consideration paid in excess of the estimated ultimate losses recoverable under the agreement at inception is recognized as a loss on reinsurance transaction. The benefit of subsequent adverse development ceded up to the total consideration paid is recognized as ceded losses and loss adjustment expenses. The excess of the estimated amounts ultimately recoverable under the agreement over the consideration paid is recognized as a deferred gain liability and amortized into income over the period the ceded losses are recovered in cash from the reinsurer. The amount of the deferred gain liability is recalculated each period based on cumulative recoveries not yet collected relative to the latest estimate of ultimate losses recoverable. Ceded loss reserves under retroactive agreements were $747 and $523, and the deferred gain liability reported in other liabilities was $16 and $0, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In any given

period, the change in deferred gain included in net income includes amortization of the deferred gain based on the percentage of ultimate ceded losses collected plus any change in the deferred gain liability due to changes in the estimated ultimate losses recoverable. The effect on income from change in the deferred gain was a charge to earnings of $16 for the year ended December 31, 2019. There was no change in the deferred gain in 2018 or 2017.
Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs
DAC represents costs that are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts and incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that are incurred in transactions with independent third parties or in compensation to employees. Such costs primarily include commissions, premium taxes, costs of policy issuance and underwriting, and certain other expenses that are directly related to successfully issued contracts.
For property and casualty insurance products and group life, disability and accident contracts, costs are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income, and if not, are charged to expense. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of DAC.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A deferred tax provision is recorded for the tax effects of differences between the Company's current taxable income and its income before tax under generally accepted accounting principles in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For deferred tax assets, the Company records a valuation allowance that is adequate to reduce the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost to acquire a business over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. The goodwill impairment test follows a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. The Company’s reporting units, for which goodwill has been allocated consist of Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, Group Benefits, and Hartford Funds. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Effective January 1, 2020, the goodwill impairment measurement will be based on the first step only and, as such, goodwill will be impaired up to the

amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value. For further information, see Goodwill discussion above.
Management’s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs into discounted cash flow calculations, including assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit. Assumptions include levels of economic capital required to support the business, future business growth, earnings projections, the weighted average cost of capital used for purposes of discounting and, for the Hartford Funds segment, assets under management. Decreases in business growth, decreases in earnings projections and increases in the weighted average cost of capital will all cause a reporting unit’s fair value to decrease, increasing the possibility of impairments.
Intangible Assets
Acquired intangible assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include purchased customer relationship and agency or other distribution rights and licenses measured at fair value at acquisition. The Company amortizes finite-lived other intangible assets over their useful lives generally on a straight-line basis over the period of expected benefit, ranging from 1 to 15 years. Management revises amortization periods if it believes there has been a change in the length of time that an intangible asset will continue to have value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment generally when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangibles. Finite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Impaired intangible assets are written down to fair value.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment, which includes capitalized software, is carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property and equipment and is determined principally on the straight-line method. Accumulated depreciation was $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Depreciation expense was $283, $232, and $197 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
For property and casualty and group life and disability insurance and assumed reinsurance products, the Company establishes reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies written by the Company. These reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported ("IBNR"), and include estimates of all losses and loss adjustment expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of future losses and loss adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process. This estimation process is based significantly on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events, and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience, trends and other relevant factors. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered

in the reserving process. A number of complex factors influence the uncertainties involved with the reserving process including social and economic trends and changes in the concepts of legal liability and damage awards. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of its estimated losses and loss adjustment expense reserves by reserve line within the various reporting segments. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary. Such adjustments could possibly be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends.
Most of the Company’s property and casualty insurance products reserves are not discounted. However, the Company has discounted to present value certain reserves for indemnity payments that are due to claimants under workers’ compensation policies because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rate is based on the risk free rate for the expected claim duration as determined in the year the claims were incurred. The Company also has discounted liabilities for structured settlement agreements that provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. These structured settlements include annuities purchased to fund unpaid losses for permanently disabled claimants. These structured settlement liabilities are discounted to present value using the rate implicit in the purchased annuities and the purchased annuities are accounted for within reinsurance recoverables.
Group life and disability contracts with long-tail claim liabilities are discounted because the payment pattern and the ultimate costs are reasonably fixed and determinable on an individual claim basis. The discount rates are estimated based on investment yields expected to be earned on the cash flows net of investment expenses and expected credit losses. The Company establishes discount rates for these reserves in the year the claims are incurred (the incurral year) which is when the estimated settlement pattern is determined. The discount rate for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business were based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017.
For further information about how unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are established, see Note 11 - Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign Currency
Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each year end and income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The national currencies of the international operations are generally their functional currencies; however, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Lloyd's Syndicate 1221 ("Lloyd's Syndicate"), the Lloyd's Syndicate for which the Company is the sole corporate member, in the U.K. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency transactions are reflected in earnings in realized capital gains (losses) in the period in which they occur.

2. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS

Navigators Group
On May 23, 2019, The Hartford acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Navigators Group for $70 a share, or $2.121 billion in cash, comprised of cash of $2.098 billion and a liability for cash awards to replace share-based awards of $23. The acquisition of the specialty underwriter expands product offerings and geographic reach, and adds underwriting and industry talent to strengthen the Company’s value proposition to agents and customers.

The value of in-force contracts represents the estimated profits relating to the unexpired contracts in force net of related prepaid reinsurance at the acquisition date through expiry of the contracts. The value of distribution relationships was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from the renewals of in-force contracts and new business sold through existing distribution partners less costs to service the related policies. The value of the trade name was estimated using an assumed cost of a market-based royalty fee applied to net cash flows expected to come from business marketed as Navigators, a brand of The Hartford. Lloyd's of London is an insurance market-place operating worldwide ("Lloyd's"). Lloyd's does not underwrite risks. Corporate members accept underwriting risks through the syndicates that they form. The Company accepts risks as the sole corporate member of the Lloyd's Syndicate. The value of the capacity of Lloyd’s Syndicate was estimated using net cash flows attributable to Navigators Group's right to underwrite business up to an approved level of premium in the Lloyd’s market. The values for in-force contracts, the distribution relationships, trade name and the capacity of the Lloyd's Syndicate were estimated using a discounted cash flow method. Significant inputs to the valuation models include estimates of expected new business, premium retention rates, investment returns, claim costs, expenses and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital. The value of licenses to write insurance in over 50 U.S. jurisdictions was estimated based on recent transactions for shell companies.
Property and equipment includes real estate owned and right of use assets under leases that were valued based on current values and market rental rates, software that was valued based on estimated replacement cost and furniture and equipment. These will be amortized over periods consistent with the Company’s policy.
The fair value of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses net of related reinsurance recoverables was estimated based on the present value of expected future net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments discounted using a risk-free interest rate as of the acquisition date plus a risk margin. The discount and risk margin amounts substantially offset.
Debt assumed in the transaction was valued based on the principal and interest payments discounted at the current market yield. This debt was paid off in August 2019. For further discussion of this transaction, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The $623 of goodwill recognized is largely attributable to the acquired employee workforce and underwriting talent, leverageable operating platform, improved investment yield and economies of scale. Goodwill is allocated to the Company's Commercial Lines reporting segment.
Immediately after closing on the acquisition of Navigators Group, effective May 23, 2019, the Company purchased an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement covering adverse reserve development (“Navigators ADC”) from National Indemnity Company ("NICO") on behalf of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Navigators Insurers”). Under the Navigators ADC, the Navigators Insurers paid NICO a reinsurance premium of $91 in exchange for reinsurance

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

coverage of $300 of adverse net loss reserve development that attaches $100 above the Navigators Insurers' existing net loss and allocated loss adjustment reserves as of December 31, 2018 subject to the treaty of $1.816 billion for accidents and losses prior to December 31, 2018. In addition to recognizing a $91 before tax charge to earnings in 2019 for the Navigators ADC reinsurance premium, the Company recognized a charge against earnings of $97 before tax in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of a review of Navigators Insurers’ net acquired reserves upon acquisition of the business. Navigators Insurers had previously recognized $52 before tax of adverse reserve development in the first quarter of 2019, including $32 of adverse development subject to the Navigators ADC. As such, reserve development of $97 before tax recognized upon acquisition of the business included $68 remaining of the $100 Navigators ADC retention for 2018 and prior accident years and $29 of adverse reserve development related to the 2019 accident year which is not covered by the Navigators ADC.
On 2018 and prior accident year reserves subject to the Navigators ADC, the Company recognized a total of $84 of adverse development in 2019, including the $68 of reserve development recorded upon acquisition of the business. The $84 of prior accident year reserve development was net of a $91 net reinsurance benefit recognized under the Navigators ADC. While the Company has ceded $107 of losses to the ADC through December 31, 2019, which has been recognized as a reinsurance recoverable, $16 of the ceded losses has been recognized as a deferred gain within other liabilities since the Navigators ADC has been accounted for as retroactive reinsurance and cumulative losses ceded of $107 exceed the ceded premium paid of $91. As the Company has ceded $107 of the $300 available limit, there is $193 of remaining limit available as of December 31, 2019.
Since the acquisition date of May 23, 2019, the revenues and net losses of the business acquired have been included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Commercial Lines reporting segment with revenues of $1.0 billion and net losses of $167 during the period from the acquisition date to December 31, 2019, including the $91 before tax ($72 net of tax) of premium paid for the Navigators ADC, a charge of $97 before tax ($77 net of tax) for the increase in acquired reserves following the acquisition, a charge of $16 before tax ($13 net of tax) for the deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance and net investment income of $67 before tax ($54 net of tax).
The Company recognized $17 of acquisition related costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. These costs are

included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
The acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities, including insurance reserves and intangible assets, as well as the related estimated useful lives of intangibles, are provisional and are subject to revision within one year of the acquisition date.
The following table presents supplemental unaudited pro forma amounts of revenue and net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 for the Company as though the business was acquired on January 1, 2018. Pro forma adjustments include the revenue and earnings of Navigators Group for each period as well as amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired.

Aetna Group Insurance
On November 1, 2017, The Hartford acquired Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business through a reinsurance transaction for total consideration of $1.452 billion, comprised of cash of $1.450 billion and share-based awards of $2, and recorded provisional estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition enables the Company to increase its market share in the group life and disability industry. In 2018, The Hartford and Aetna agreed on the final assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and The Hartford finalized its provisional estimates with a final cash settlement within the one year measurement period allowed under U.S. GAAP. As a result, in the third quarter of 2018, The Hartford recorded additional assets and liabilities at fair value of $80 and $80, respectively, with no change in goodwill. The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, the measurement period adjustments recorded, and the final purchase price allocation.

Total $ 629

The value of in-force contracts represents the estimated profits relating to the unexpired contracts in force at the acquisition date through expiry of the contracts. The value of customer relationships was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from the renewals of in-force contracts acquired less costs to service the related policies. The value of the marketing agreement with Aetna was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from incremental new business written during the three years duration of the agreement, less costs to service the related contracts. The value for each of the identifiable intangible assets was estimated using a discounted cash flow method. Significant inputs to the valuation models include estimates of expected premiums, persistency rates, investment returns, claim costs, expenses and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital.

Property and equipment represents an internally developed integrated absence management software acquired that was valued based on estimated replacement cost. The software is amortized over 5 years on a straight-line basis.
Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses acquired were recorded at estimated fair value equal to the present value of expected future unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments discounted using the net investment yield estimated as of the acquisition date plus a risk margin. The fair value adjustment for the risk margin is amortized over 12 years based on the payout pattern of losses and loss expenses as estimated as of the acquisition date.
The revenues and earnings of the business acquired are included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Group Benefits reporting segment and were $370 and $(37) in the year of acquisition, respectively.
The $723 of goodwill recognized is largely attributable to the acquired employee workforce, expected expense synergies, economies of scale, and tax benefits not included within the value of identifiable intangibles. Goodwill is allocated to the Company's Group Benefits reporting segment.
The Company recognized $17 of acquisition related costs in the year of acquisition. These costs are included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of assumed exercise or issuance of warrants and stock-based awards under compensation plans.
In periods where a loss from continuing operations available to common stockholders or net loss available to common stockholders is recognized, inclusion of incremental dilutive shares would be antidilutive. Due to the antidilutive impact, such shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation of income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, available to common stockholders and net income (loss) available to common stockholders in such periods. As a result, for the year

ended December 31, 2017, the Company was required to use basic weighted average common shares outstanding in the diluted calculations, since the inclusion of 4.3 million shares for stock compensation plans and 2.5 million shares for warrants would have been antidilutive to the calculations.
Under the treasury stock method, for warrants and stock-based awards, shares are assumed to be issued and then reduced for the number of shares repurchaseable with theoretical proceeds at the average market price for the period. Contingently issuable shares are included for the number of shares issuable assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period, if dilutive.

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company carries certain financial assets and liabilities at estimated fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants. Our fair value framework includes a

hierarchy that gives the highest priority to the use of quoted prices in active markets, followed by the use of market observable inputs, followed by the use of unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy levels are as follows:

F-24

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1 Fair values based primarily on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets, or liabilities, in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2 Fair values primarily based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, or based on prices for similar assets and liabilities.

------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 3 Fair values derived when one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable (including assumptions about risk). With little or no observable market, the determination of fair values uses considerable judgment and represents the

Company’s best estimate of an amount that could be realized in a market exchange for the asset or liability. Also included are securities that are traded within illiquid markets and/or priced by independent brokers.
The Company will classify the financial asset or liability by level based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. In most cases, both observable inputs (e.g., changes in interest rates) and unobservable inputs (e.g., changes in risk assumptions) are used to determine fair values that the Company has classified within Level 3.

Valuation Techniques
The Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar

instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a "waterfall" approach comprised of the following pricing sources and techniques, which are listed in priority order:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, which are classified as Level 1.

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Prices from third-party pricing services, which primarily utilize a combination of techniques. These services utilize recently reported trades of identical, similar, or benchmark securities making adjustments for market observable inputs available through the reporting date. If there are no recently reported trades, they may use a discounted cash flow technique to develop a price using expected cash flows based

F-26

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

upon the anticipated future performance of the underlying collateral discounted at an estimated market rate. Both techniques develop prices that consider the time value of future cash flows and provide a margin for risk, including liquidity and credit risk. Most prices provided by third-party pricing services are classified as Level 2 because the inputs used in pricing the securities are observable. However, some securities that are less liquid or trade less actively are classified as Level 3. Additionally, certain long-dated securities, such as municipal securities and bank loans, include benchmark interest rate or credit spread assumptions that are not observable in the marketplace and are thus classified as Level 3.

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Internal matrix pricing, which is a valuation process internally developed for private placement securities for which the Company is unable to obtain a price from a third-party pricing service. Internal pricing matrices determine credit spreads that, when combined with risk-free rates, are applied to contractual cash flows to develop a price. The Company develops credit spreads using market based data for public securities adjusted for credit spread differentials between public and private securities, which are obtained from a survey of multiple private placement brokers. The market-based reference credit spread considers the issuer’s financial strength and term to maturity, using an independent public security index and trade information, while the credit spread differential considers the non-public nature of the security. Securities priced using internal matrix pricing are classified as Level 2 because the inputs are observable or can be corroborated with observable data.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Independent broker quotes, which are typically non-binding, use inputs that can be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data. Brokers may use present value techniques using assumptions specific to the security types, or they may use recent transactions of similar securities. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3.

The fair value of derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporates counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives

may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. The pricing valuation models primarily use inputs that are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data. The valuation of certain derivatives may include significant inputs that are unobservable, such as volatility levels, and reflect the Company’s view of what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments.
Valuation Controls
The process for determining the fair value of investments is monitored by the Valuation Committee, which is a cross-functional group of senior management within the Company. The purpose of the Valuation Committee is to provide oversight of the pricing policy, procedures and controls, including approval of valuation methodologies and pricing sources. The Valuation Committee reviews market data trends, pricing statistics and trading statistics to ensure that prices are reasonable and consistent with our fair value framework. Controls and procedures used to assess third-party pricing services are reviewed by the Valuation Committee, including the results of annual due-diligence reviews. Controls include, but are not limited to, reviewing daily and monthly price changes, stale prices, and missing prices and comparing new trade prices to third-party pricing services, weekly price changes to published bond prices of a corporate bond index, and daily OTC derivative market valuations to counterparty valuations. The Company has a dedicated pricing unit that works with trading and investment professionals to challenge the price received by a third party pricing source if the Company believes that the valuation received does not accurately reflect the fair value. New valuation models and changes to current models require approval by the Valuation Committee. In addition, the Company’s enterprise-wide Operational Risk Management function provides an independent review of the suitability and reliability of model inputs, as well as an analysis of significant changes to current models.
Valuation Inputs
Quoted prices for identical assets in active markets are considered Level 1 and consist of on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, exchange-traded equity securities, open-ended mutual funds, certain short-term investments, and exchange traded futures and option contracts.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The tables above exclude certain securities for which fair values are predominately based on independent broker quotes. While the Company does not have access to the significant unobservable inputs that independent brokers may use in their pricing process, the Company believes brokers likely use inputs similar to those used by the Company and third-party pricing services to price similar instruments. As such, in their pricing models, brokers likely use estimated loss severity rates, prepayment rates, constant default rates and credit spreads. Therefore, similar to non-broker priced securities, increases in these inputs would generally cause fair values to decrease. For the year ended December 31, 2019, no significant adjustments were made by the Company to broker prices received.

Contingent Consideration
The acquisition of Lattice Strategies LLC ("Lattice") on July 29, 2016 requires the Company to make payments to former owners of Lattice of up to $60 contingent upon growth in ETP AUM over a period of four years beginning on the date of acquisition. The contingent consideration is measured at fair value on a quarterly basis by projecting future eligible ETP AUM over the contingency period to estimate the amount of expected payout. The future expected payout is discounted back to the valuation date using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 11.8%. The risk-adjusted discount rate is an internally generated and significant unobservable input to fair value.
The contingency period for ETP AUM growth ends July 29, 2020 and management adjusts the fair value of the contingent consideration when it revises its projection of ETP AUM for the

acquired business. Before discounting to fair value, the Company estimates a total contingent consideration payout of $43 , of which $20 was paid in the twelve months of 2019 with ETP AUM of $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019, the fair value of $22 reflects remaining consideration payable of $23, assuming ETP AUM for the acquired business grows to approximately $4.1 billion over the contingency period.
Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Using Significant Unobservable Inputs
The Company uses derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and liabilities. However, the derivative instrument may not be classified with the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated asset or liability. Therefore, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives reported in the Level 3 rollforward may be offset by realized and unrealized gains and losses of the associated assets and liabilities in other line items of the financial statements.

Fair Value Option
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain RMBS that contain embedded credit derivatives with underlying credit risk. These securities are included within Fixed Maturities, FVO on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of these securities are reported in net realized capital gains and losses.
As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the fair value of assets and liabilities using the fair value option was $11 and $22, respectively, within the residential real estate sector.

For the year-ended December 31, 2019, there were no realized capital gains (losses) related to the fair value of assets using the fair value option. For the year-ended December 31, 2018, the realized capital gains (losses) related to the fair value of assets using the fair value option were $(1) within the residential real estate sector. For the year-ended December 31, 2017, the income earned from FVO and the changes recorded in net realized capital gains (losses) were driven by corporate bond and equity securities of $(1) and $1, respectively.

Sales of AFS securities in 2019 were primarily a result of duration and liquidity management as well as tactical changes to the portfolio as a result of changing market conditions.
Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments
The Company will record an OTTI for fixed maturities if the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before a recovery in value. A corresponding charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security.
The Company will also record an OTTI for those fixed maturities for which the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For these securities, the excess of the amortized cost basis over its fair value is separated into the portion representing a credit OTTI, which is recorded in net realized capital losses, and the remaining non-credit amount, which is recorded in OCI. The credit OTTI amount is the excess of its amortized cost basis over the Company’s best estimate of discounted expected future cash flows. The non-credit amount is the excess of the best estimate of the discounted expected future cash flows over the fair value. The Company’s best estimate of discounted expected future cash flows becomes the new cost basis and accretes prospectively into net investment income over the estimated remaining life of the security.
Developing the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third-party sources along with certain internal assumptions regarding the future performance. The Company's considerations include, but are not limited to, (a) changes in the financial condition of the issuer and the underlying collateral, (b) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (c) credit ratings, (d) payment structure of the security and (e) the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security.
For non-structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, economic and industry-specific trends and fundamentals, security-specific developments, industry earnings multiples and the issuer’s ability to restructure and execute asset sales.

For structured securities, assumptions include, but are not limited to, various performance indicators such as historical and projected default and recovery rates, credit ratings, current and projected delinquency rates, loan-to-value ("LTV") ratios, average cumulative collateral loss rates that vary by vintage year, prepayment speeds, and property value declines. These assumptions require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability of issuer default and estimates regarding timing and amount of expected recoveries which may include estimating the underlying collateral value.
Prior to January 1, 2018, the Company recorded an OTTI for certain equity securities with debt-like characteristics if the Company intended to sell or it was more likely than not that the Company was required to sell the security before a recovery in value as well as for those equity securities for which the Company did not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis. The Company also recorded an OTTI for equity securities where the decline in the fair value was deemed to be other-than-temporary.

Estimated maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to security call or prepayment provisions. Due to the potential for variability in payment speeds (i.e. prepayments or extensions), mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are not categorized by contractual maturity.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company aims to maintain a diversified investment portfolio including issuer, sector and geographic stratification, where applicable, and has established certain exposure limits, diversification standards and review procedures to mitigate credit risk. The Company had no investment exposure to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than 10% of the Company's stockholders' equity, other than the U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies as of December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies, the Company’s three largest exposures by issuer were the Government of United Kingdom, New York State Dormitory Authority, and the Wells Fargo & Company each of which comprised less than 1% of total invested assets. As of December 31, 2018, other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies, the Company’s three largest exposures by

issuer were New York State Dormitory Authority, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the New York City Transitional Finance Authority each of which comprised less than 1% of total invested assets. The Company’s three largest exposures by sector as of December 31, 2019 were the municipal, RMBS, and CMBS sectors which comprised approximately 18%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of total invested assets. The Company’s three largest exposures by sector as of December 31, 2018 were municipal securities, CMBS, and the financial services sectors which comprised approximately 22%, 8% and 7%, respectively, of total invested assets.

As of December 31, 2019, AFS securities in an unrealized loss position consisted of 871 securities, primarily in the corporate and CMBS sectors, which were depressed primarily due to widening of credit spreads since the securities were purchased. As of December 31, 2019, 96% of these securities were depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The decrease in unrealized losses during 2019 was primarily attributable to lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads.
Most of the securities depressed for twelve months or more relate to corporate, CMBS, and CLO securities. Corporate, CMBS, and CLO securities were primarily depressed because current market spreads are wider than at the securities' respective purchase dates. Certain other corporate securities were depressed because the securities have floating-rate coupons and have long-dated maturities, and current credit spreads are wider than when these securities were purchased. The Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell the securities outlined in the preceding discussion.
Mortgage Loans
Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowances
Mortgage loans are considered to be impaired when management estimates that, based upon current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The

Company reviews mortgage loans on a quarterly basis to identify potential credit losses. Among other factors, management reviews current and projected macroeconomic trends, such as unemployment rates and property-specific factors such as rental rates, occupancy levels, LTV ratios and debt service coverage ratios (“DSCR”). In addition, the Company considers historical, current and projected delinquency rates and property values. Estimates of collectibility require the use of significant management judgment and include the probability and timing of borrower default and loss severity estimates. In addition, cash flow projections may change based upon new information about the borrower's ability to pay and/or the value of underlying collateral such as changes in projected property value estimates.
For mortgage loans that are deemed impaired, a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. The mortgage loan's estimated fair value is most frequently the Company's share of the fair value of the collateral but may also be the Company’s share of either (a) the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or (b) the loan’s observable market price. A valuation allowance may be recorded for an individual loan or for a group of loans that have an LTV ratio of 90% or greater, a low DSCR or have other lower credit quality characteristics. Changes in valuation allowances are recorded in net realized capital gains and losses. Interest income on impaired loans is accrued to the extent it is deemed collectible and the borrowers continue to make payments under the original or

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

restructured loan terms. The Company stops accruing interest income on loans when it is probable that the Company will not receive interest and principal payments according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company resumes accruing interest income when it determines that sufficient collateral exists to satisfy the full amount of the loan principal and interest payments and when it is probable cash will be received in the foreseeable future. Interest income on defaulted loans is recognized when received.
As of December 31, 2019, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $4.2 billion and carrying value of $4.2 billion, with no valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2018, mortgage loans had an amortized cost of $3.7 billion and carrying value of $3.7 billion, with a valuation allowance of $1.
As of December 31, 2019, there were no mortgage loans that had a valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying value of mortgage loans that had a valuation allowance was $23. There were no mortgage loans held-for-sale as of both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no mortgage loans that have had extensions or restructurings other than what is allowable under the original terms of the contract.
The following table presents the activity within the Company’s valuation allowance for mortgage loans. These loans have been evaluated both individually and collectively for impairment. Loans evaluated collectively for impairment are immaterial.

The weighted-average LTV ratio of the Company’s mortgage loan portfolio was 52% as of December 31, 2019, while the weighted-average LTV ratio at origination of these loans was 61%. LTV ratios compare the loan amount to the value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan. The loan collateral values are updated no less than annually through reviews of the underlying properties. Factors considered in estimating property values include, among other things, actual and expected property cash flows, geographic market data and the ratio of the property's net operating income to its value. DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to the borrower’s principal and interest payments. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company held no delinquent commercial mortgages loan past due by 90 days or more.

Mortgage Servicing
The Company originates, sells and services commercial mortgage loans on behalf of third parties and recognizes servicing fee income over the period that services are performed. As of December 31, 2019, under this program, the Company serviced mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal of $6.4 billion, of which $3.5 billion was serviced on behalf of third parties and $2.9 billion was retained and reported in total investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2018, the Company serviced mortgage loans with a total outstanding principal balance of $6.0 billion, of which $3.6 billion

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

was serviced on behalf of third parties and $2.4 billion was retained and reported in total investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and were $0 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, because servicing fees were market-level fees at origination and remain adequate to compensate the Company for servicing the loans.
Variable Interest Entities
The Company is engaged with various special purpose entities and other entities that are deemed to be VIEs primarily as an investor through normal investment activities but also as an investment manager.
A VIE is an entity that either has investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as simple majority kick-out rights, or lacks sufficient funds to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities. The Company performs ongoing qualitative assessments of its VIEs to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore is the primary beneficiary. The Company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest when it has both the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Based on the Company’s assessment, if it determines it is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates the VIE in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Consolidated VIEs
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not hold any securities for which it is the primary beneficiary.
Non-Consolidated VIEs
The Company, through normal investment activities, makes passive investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments. For these non-consolidated VIEs, the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary as it has no ability to direct activities that could significantly affect the economic performance of the investments. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 is limited to the total carrying value of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, which are included in limited partnerships and other alternative investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $851 and $718, respectively, whereby the Company is committed to fund these investments and may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. These investments are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in management.
In addition, the Company makes passive investments in structured securities issued by VIEs for which the Company is not the manager. These investments are included in ABS, CLOs, CMBS and RMBS and are reported in fixed maturities, available-for-sale, and fixed maturities, FVO, in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not provided financial or other support with respect to these investments other than its original investment. For these investments, the Company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to the relative size of the Company’s investment in comparison to the

principal amount of the structured securities issued by the VIEs, the level of credit subordination which reduces the Company’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits and the Company’s inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIEs. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on these investments is limited to the amount of the Company’s investment.
Securities Lending, Repurchase Agreements, and Other Collateral Transactions and Restricted Investments
The Company enters into securities financing transactions as a way to earn additional income or manage liquidity, primarily through securities lending and repurchase agreements.

[1] Cash collateral received is reinvested in fixed maturities, AFS and short term investments which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amount includes additional securities collateral received of $34 and $3 which are excluded from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

[2] Collateral pledged is included within fixed maturities, AFS and short term investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Securities Lending
Under a securities lending program, the Company lends certain fixed maturities within the corporate, foreign government/government agencies, and municipal sectors as well as equity securities to qualifying third-party borrowers in return for collateral in the form of cash or securities. For domestic and non-domestic loaned securities, respectively, borrowers provide collateral of 102% and 105% of the fair value of the securities lent at the time of the loan. Borrowers will return the securities to the Company for cash or securities collateral at maturity dates generally of 90 days or less. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, except in the event of default by the counterparty, and is not reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additional collateral is obtained if the fair value of the collateral falls below 100% of the fair value of the loaned securities. The agreements are continuous and do not have stated maturity dates and provide the counterparty the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

right to sell or re-pledge the securities loaned. If cash, rather than securities, is received as collateral, the cash is typically invested in short-term investments or fixed maturities and is reported as an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income associated with securities lending transactions is reported as a component of net investment income in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Repurchase Agreements
From time to time, the Company enters into repurchase agreements to manage liquidity or to earn incremental income. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which one party (transferor) agrees to sell securities to another party (transferee) in return for cash (or securities), with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the same securities at a specified price at a later date. The maturity of these transactions is generally ninety days or less. Repurchase agreements include master netting provisions that provide both parties the right to offset claims and apply securities held by them with respect to their obligations in the event of a default. Although the Company has the contractual right to offset claims, the Company's current positions do not meet the specific conditions for net presentation.
Under repurchase agreements, the Company transfers collateral of U.S. government and government agency securities and receives cash. For repurchase agreements, the Company obtains cash in an amount equal to at least 95% of the fair value of the securities transferred. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred when necessary and provide the counterparty the right to sell or re-pledge the securities transferred. The cash received from the repurchase program is typically invested in short-term investments or fixed maturities and is reported as an asset on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company accounts for the repurchase agreements as collateralized borrowings. The securities transferred under repurchase agreements are included in fixed maturities, AFS with the obligation to repurchase those securities recorded in other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
From time to time, the Company enters into reverse repurchase agreements where the Company purchases securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same or substantially the same securities. The maturity of these transactions is generally within one year. The agreements require additional collateral to be transferred to the Company when necessary and the Company has the right to sell or re-pledge the securities received. The Company accounts for reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing. The receivable for reverse repurchase agreements is included within short-term investments in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Other Collateral Transactions
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company pledged collateral of $37 and $47, respectively, of U.S. government securities and municipal securities or cash primarily related to certain bank loan participations committed to through a limited partnership agreement. These amounts also include collateral related to letters of credit.
For disclosure of collateral in support of derivative transactions, refer to the Derivative Collateral Arrangements section in Note 7 - Derivatives of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Restricted Investments
The Company is required by law to deposit securities with government agencies in certain states in which it conducts business. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of securities on deposit was $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.
In addition, as of December 31, 2019, the Company held fixed maturities and short-term investments of $447 and $189, respectively, in a trust for the benefit of syndicate policyholders and other investments of $38 primarily consisting of overseas deposits in various countries with Lloyd's to support underwriting activities in those countries.
Equity Method Investments
The majority of the Company's investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments, including hedge funds, real estate funds, and private equity funds (collectively, “limited partnerships”), are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The remainder of investments in limited partnerships and other alternative investments consists of investments in insurer-owned life insurance accounted for at cash surrender value. The Company's investment in Hopmeadow Holdings LP is reported in other assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For further discussion on Hopmeadow Holdings LP, see Note 21 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company recognized total equity method income of $267, $214, and $168 for the periods ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Equity method income is reported in net investment income, except amounts related to strategic investments classified in other assets which are reported in other revenues. For investments accounted for under the equity method, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2019 is limited to the total carrying value of $1.6 billion. In addition, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $852 to fund limited partnership investments as of December 31, 2019. The Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not take an active role in the management.
In 2019, aggregate investment income from investments accounted for under the equity method exceeded 10% of the Company’s pre-tax consolidated net income (loss). Accordingly, the Company is disclosing aggregated, summarized financial data for the Company’s investments accounted for under the equity method. This aggregated, summarized financial data does not represent the Company’s proportionate share of investees' assets or earnings. Aggregate total assets of the investees totaled $329.4 billion and $311.0 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Aggregate total liabilities of the investees totaled $191.2 billion and $187.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Aggregate net investment income of the investees totaled $618, $773, and $1.9 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Aggregate net income excluding net investment income of the investees totaled $13.4 billion, $12.3 billion and $9.8 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of, and for the period ended, December 31, 2019,

the aggregated summarized financial data reflects the latest available financial information.

7. DERIVATIVES

The Company utilizes a variety of OTC, OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivative instruments as a part of its overall risk management strategy as well as to enter into replication transactions. Derivative instruments are used to manage risk associated with interest rate, equity market, credit spread, issuer default, price, and currency exchange rate risk or volatility. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies.
Strategies that Qualify for Hedge Accounting
Some of the Company's derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements as outlined in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Typically, these hedging instruments include interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency swaps where the terms or expected cash flows of the hedged item closely match the terms of the swap. The interest rate swaps are typically used to manage interest rate duration of certain fixed maturity securities or debt instruments issued. The hedge strategies by hedge accounting designation include:
Cash Flow Hedges
Interest rate swaps are predominantly used to manage portfolio duration and better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities. These derivatives primarily convert interest receipts on floating-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates. The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps to convert the variable interest payments on 3 month LIBOR + 2.125% junior subordinated debt to fixed interest payments. For further information, see the Junior Subordinated Debentures section within Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency-denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates.
The Company also previously entered into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure related to the future purchase of fixed-rate securities, primarily to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain group benefits liabilities.
Non-qualifying Strategies
Derivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting (“non-qualifying strategies”) primarily include hedging and replication strategies that utilize credit default swaps. In addition, hedges of interest rate, foreign currency and equity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities do not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying strategies include:

Credit Contracts
Credit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company to pay or receive a periodic fee in exchange for compensation from the counterparty should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. In addition, the Company enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.
Interest Rate Swaps, Swaptions and Futures
The Company uses interest rate swaps, swaptions and futures to manage interest rate duration between assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps to terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the notional amount of interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships was $7.6 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.
Foreign Currency Swaps and Forwards
The Company enters into foreign currency swaps to convert the foreign currency exposures of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity investments to U.S. dollars. The Company may at times enter into foreign currency forwards to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash and, previously, equity securities. The Company previously entered into foreign currency forwards to hedge currency impacts on changes in equity of the U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries that were sold in May 2017. For further information on the disposition, see Note 21 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Equity Index Options
The Company enters into equity index options to hedge the impact of a decline in the equity markets on the investment portfolio. The Company also enters into covered call options on equity securities to generate additional return.
Contingent Capital Facility Put Option
The Company previously entered into a put option agreement that provided the Company the right to require a third-party trust to purchase, at any time, The Hartford’s junior subordinated notes in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $500. On February 8, 2017, The Hartford exercised the put option resulting in the issuance of $500 in junior subordinated notes with proceeds received on February 15, 2017. Under the put option agreement, The Hartford had been paying premiums on a periodic basis and had agreed to reimburse the trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses.

Derivative Balance Sheet Classification
For reporting purposes, the Company has elected to offset within assets or liabilities based upon the net of the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset. The following fair value amounts do not include income

accruals or related cash collateral receivables and payables, which are netted with derivative fair value amounts to determine balance sheet presentation. The Company’s derivative instruments are held for risk management purposes, unless otherwise noted in the following table. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and is presented in the table to quantify the volume of the Company’s derivative activity. Notional amounts are not necessarily reflective of credit risk.

Offsetting of Derivative Assets/Liabilities

The following tables present the gross fair value amounts, the amounts offset, and net position of derivative instruments eligible for offset in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts offset include fair value amounts, income accruals and related cash collateral receivables and payables associated with derivative instruments that are traded under a common master

netting agreement, as described in the preceding discussion. Also included in the tables are financial collateral receivables and payables, which are contractually permitted to be offset upon an event of default, although are disallowed for offsetting under U.S. GAAP.

As of December 31, 2019, the before tax deferred net gains on derivative instruments recorded in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are $16. This expectation is based on the anticipated interest payments on hedged investments in fixed maturity securities that will occur over the next twelve months, at which time the Company will recognize the deferred net gains (losses) as an adjustment to net investment income over the term of the investment cash flows.

During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company had no net reclassifications from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring.

Credit Risk Assumed through Credit Derivatives
The Company enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk of a single entity or referenced index in order to synthetically replicate investment transactions that are permissible under the Company's investment policies. The Company will receive periodic payments based on an agreed upon rate and notional amount and will only make a payment if there is a credit event. A credit event payment will typically be equal to the notional value of the swap contract less the value of the referenced security

issuer’s debt obligation after the occurrence of the credit event. A credit event is generally defined as a default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy of the referenced entity. The credit default swaps in which the Company assumes credit risk primarily reference investment grade single corporate issuers and baskets, which include standard diversified portfolios of corporate and CMBS issuers. The diversified portfolios of corporate issuers are established within sector concentration limits and may be divided into tranches that possess different credit ratings.

Derivative Collateral Arrangements
The Company enters into various collateral arrangements in connection with its derivative instruments, which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company pledged cash collateral with a fair value of less than $1 and $4 associated with derivative instruments. The collateral receivable has been recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as determined by the Company's election to offset on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company also pledged securities collateral associated with derivative instruments with a fair value of $78 and $67, respectively, which have been included in fixed maturities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The counterparties generally have the right to sell or re-pledge these securities.

In addition, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company has pledged initial margin of securities related to OTC-cleared and exchange traded derivatives with a fair value of $88 and $89, respectively, which are included within fixed maturities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company accepted cash collateral associated with derivative instruments of $16 and $9, respectively, which was invested and recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in fixed maturities and short-term investments with corresponding amounts recorded in other investments or other liabilities as determined by the Company's election to offset on the balance sheet. The Company also accepted securities collateral as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 with a fair value of $1 and $5, respectively, which the Company has the ability to sell or repledge. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had no repledged securities and no securities held as collateral have been sold. In addition, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, non-cash collateral accepted was held in separate

custodial accounts and was not included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

8. REINSURANCE

The Company cedes insurance risk to reinsurers to enable the Company to manage capital and risk exposure. Such arrangements do not relieve the Company of its primary liability to policyholders. Failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. The Company's procedures include carefully selecting its reinsurers, structuring agreements to provide collateral funds where necessary, and regularly monitoring the financial condition and ratings of its reinsurers.
The Company has two adverse development cover (“ADC”) reinsurance agreements in place, both of which are accounted for as retroactive reinsurance. One agreement covers substantially all asbestos and environmental ("A&E") reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years ("A&E ADC") and the Navigators ADC covers substantially all reserve development of Navigators Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates for 2018 and prior accident years. For more information on ADC agreements, see Note 1 -Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 11 -Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.
Property and Casualty ceded losses, which reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, were $826, $661 and $901 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Group Benefits ceded losses, which reduce losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, were $73, $116 and $120 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Reinsurance Recoverables
Reinsurance recoverables include balances due from reinsurance companies and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Reinsurance recoverables include an estimate of the amount of gross losses and loss adjustment expense reserves that may be ceded under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, including incurred but not reported unpaid losses. The Company’s estimate of losses and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to reinsurers is based on assumptions that are consistent with those used in establishing the gross reserves for amounts the Company owes to its claimants. The Company estimates its ceded reinsurance recoverables based on the terms of any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance, including an estimate of how incurred but not reported losses will ultimately be ceded under reinsurance agreements. Accordingly, the Company’s estimate of reinsurance recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimate of the gross reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

--- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] No allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was required as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance reflects management’s best estimate of reinsurance cessions that may be uncollectible in the future due to reinsurers’ unwillingness or inability to pay. The Company analyzes recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedants, recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between reinsurers and cedants and the overall credit quality of the Company’s reinsurers. Based on this analysis, the Company may adjust the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance or charge off reinsurer balances that are determined to be uncollectible. Where its contracts permit, the Company secures future claim

obligations with various forms of collateral, including irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts, funds held accounts and group-wide offsets.
Due to the inherent uncertainties as to collection and the length of time before reinsurance recoverables become due, it is possible that future adjustments to the Company’s reinsurance recoverables, net of the allowance, could be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period.

For its group benefits products, the Company reinsures certain of its risks to other reinsurers under yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements and variations thereto. Yearly renewable term and coinsurance arrangements result in passing a portion of the risk to the reinsurer. Generally, the reinsurer receives a proportionate amount of the premiums less an allowance for commissions and expenses and is liable for a corresponding proportionate amount of all benefit payments. The increase in premiums assumed from 2017 to 2018 was primarily

due to premiums related to Aetna's U.S. group life and disability business acquired by the Company effective November 1, 2017 whereby Aetna is fronting the business for a period of time. As that business is re-written through Hartford writing companies, the amount of assumed reinsurance for Group Benefits will decrease and gross premium written on a direct basis will increase.

Range of discount rates 1.76 % - 14.03 % 1.77 % - 14.15 % 1.77 % - 14.15 %

The current accident year benefit from discounting property and casualty insurance product reserves was $33 in 2019, $12 in 2018 and $15 in 2017. Reserves are discounted at rates in effect at the time claims were incurred, ranging from 1.76% for accident year 2012 to 14.03% for accident year 1981.
The reserves recorded for the Company’s property and casualty insurance products at December 31, 2019 represent the Company’s best estimate of its ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the Company. However, because of the significant uncertainties surrounding reserves it is possible that management’s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company’s results of operations or cash flows.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses are also impacted by trends including frequency and severity as well as changes in the legislative and regulatory environment. In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in the ultimate settlement of the liabilities gross of reinsurance include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures before reinsurance, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty in gross reserves include expanding theories of liabilities and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.

2019 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves
Workers’ compensation reserves were reduced, principally in small commercial driven by lower than previously estimated claim severity for the 2014 through 2017 accident years and, to a lesser extent, in national accounts due to lower estimated claim severity, primarily for accident years 2013 and prior.
General liability reserves were increased, primarily due to reserve increases in small commercial for accident years 2017 and 2018 due to higher frequency of high-severity bodily injury

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

claims, reserve increases in middle & large commercial for accident years 2015 to 2018 due to higher estimated severity, as well as increased estimated severity on the acquired Navigators Group book of business related to U.S. construction, premises liability, products liability and excess casualty, mostly related to accident years 2014 to 2017. In addition, an increase in reserves for mass torts for 2009 and prior accident years was offset by a decrease in reserves for extra contractual liability claims for more recent accident years, including the 2018 accident year.
Marine reserves were increased, principally related to pollution exposure from the 1980s and 1990s related to the Navigators Group book of business.
Package business reserves were decreased, primarily due to favorable emergence on property claims related to accident years 2016 through 2018 and due to favorable development of loss adjustment expenses on general liability claims for 2017 and prior accident years.
Commercial property reserves were decreased, principally due to favorable emergence of reported losses, including on the acquired Navigators Group book of business, related to offshore energy in accident years 2017 to 2018 and construction engineering across accident years 2015 to 2018.
Professional liability reserves were increased, primarily due to increased securities litigation and large loss activity, including wrongful termination and discrimination claims, related to accident years 2017 and 2018 and increased estimated frequency and severity of directors’ and officers’ reserves on the Navigators Group book of business, principally for the 2014 to 2018 accident years.  Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in average severity on public company directors’ and officers’ claim reserves and errors and omissions claim reserves for accident years 2014 and prior.
Automobile liability reserves were decreased in Personal Lines and increased in Commercial Lines.  The decrease in Personal Lines was due to the emergence of lower estimated severity in automobile liability for accident year 2017.  The increase in Commercial Lines was due to higher estimated severity on national accounts, principally in accident years 2017 and 2018, and higher estimated severity for accident year 2018 in small commercial and middle market, partially offset by lower estimated severity for 2017 and prior accident years in small commercial and middle market.
Catastrophes reserves were reduced, primarily as a result of lower estimated net losses from 2017 hurricanes Harvey and Irma and the 2017 California wildfires. While gross loss reserve estimates for the 2018 California wildfires were also reduced, this was largely offset by a reduction in reinsurance recoverables resulting in very little change to estimated net losses from those wildfires.
In December, 2019, the judge overseeing the bankruptcy of PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (together, “PG&E”) approved an $11 billion settlement with insurers representing approximately 85 percent of insurance subrogation claims to resolve all such claims arising from the 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2018 Camp wildfire. The bankruptcy court has also approved PG&E’s settlement with individual wildfire claimants.  Those settlements are subject to confirmation by the bankruptcy court of a chapter 11 plan of reorganization

("PG&E Plan") which implements the terms of the settlements. If the PG&E Plan is approved, certain of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries would be entitled to settlement payments of subrogation claims. Based on reserve estimates submitted with the subrogation request, the amount our subsidiaries could collect from PG&E, if any, would be approximately $300 to $325 but could be more or less than that amount depending on how the Company’s ultimate paid claims subject to subrogation compare to other insurers’ ultimate paid claims subject to subrogation. Confirmation of the PG&E Plan and amount of the Company’s ultimate subrogation recoveries from PG&E are subject to uncertainty, including but not limited to resolution of objections raised by the Governor of California and others.
Given the uncertainty about whether the PG&E Plan will be confirmed, the Company has not recognized a benefit from potential subrogation from PG&E and will evaluate in future periods when more information becomes known. In connection with the 2018 Camp wildfire, the Company has recognized a $12 reinsurance recoverable for losses incurred in excess of a $350 per occurrence retention. Under its 2018 property aggregate catastrophe treaty, the Company has recognized a reinsurance recoverable for aggregate catastrophe losses in excess of an $825 retention, with the recoverable currently estimated at $45. As such, the first $57 of subrogation recoveries would be offset by a $57 reduction in these reinsurance recoverables resulting in no net benefit to income.
Uncollectible reinsurance reserves were reduced due to higher than expected recoveries from reinsurers in older accident years.
Other reserve re-estimates, net, primarily represents an increase in unallocated loss adjustment expense ('ULAE") reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations that was driven by an increase in gross asbestos and environmental reserves, as well as higher than anticipated ULAE costs in recent years, prompting an increase in the projected ULAE run rate.
2018 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves
Workers’ compensation reserves were reduced in small commercial and middle market, primarily for accident years 2014 and 2015, as claim severity has emerged favorably compared to previous reserve estimates. Also contributing was a reduction in estimated reserves for ULAE.
General liability reserves were increased, primarily due to an increase in reserves for higher hazard general liability exposures in middle market for accident years 2009 to 2017, partially offset by a decrease in reserves for other lines within middle market, including premises and operations, umbrella and products liability, principally for accident years 2015 and prior. Contributing to the increase in reserves for higher hazard general liability exposures was an increase in average claim severity, including from large losses and, in more recent accident years, an increase in claim frequency. Contributing to the reduction in reserves for other middle market lines were more favorable outcomes due to initiatives to reduce legal expenses. In addition, reserve increases for claims with lead paint exposure were offset by reserve decreases for other mass torts and extra-contractual liability claims.

F-51

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Package business reserves were reduced, primarily due to lower reserve estimates for both liability and property for accident years 2010 and prior, including a recovery of loss adjustment expenses for the 2005 accident year.
Commercial property reserves were reduced, driven by an increase in estimated reinsurance recoverables on middle market property losses from the 2017 accident year.
Professional liability reserves were reduced, principally for accident years 2014 and prior, for directors and officers liability claims principally due to a number of older claims closing with limited or no payment.
Automobile liability reserves were reduced, primarily driven by reduced estimates of loss adjustment expenses in small commercial for recent accident years and favorable development in personal automobile liability for accident years 2014 to 2017, principally due to lower severity, including with uninsured and underinsured motorist claims.
Homeowners reserves were reduced, primarily in accident years 2013 to 2017, driven by lower than expected severity across multiple perils.
Asbestos and environmental reserves were unchanged as $238 of adverse development arising from the fourth quarter 2018 comprehensive annual review was offset by a $238 recoverable from NICO. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see Note 8 - Reinsurance and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Catastrophe reserves were reduced, primarily as a result of lower estimated net losses from 2017 catastrophes, principally related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Before reinsurance, estimated losses for 2017 catastrophe events decreased by $133, resulting in a decrease in reinsurance recoverables of $90 as the Company no longer expects to recover under the 2017 Property Aggregate reinsurance treaty as aggregate ultimate losses for 2017 catastrophe events are now projected to be less than $850.
Uncollectible reinsurance reserves were increased due to lower anticipated recoveries related to older accident years.
Other reserve re-estimates, net, primarily represents an increase in ULAE reserves in Property & Casualty Other Operations that was principally driven by an increase in expected claim handling costs associated with asbestos and environmental and mass tort claims.
2017 re-estimates of prior accident year reserves
Workers’ compensation reserves were reduced in small commercial and middle market, given the continued emergence of favorable frequency, primarily for accident years 2013 to 2015, as well as a reduction in estimated reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses, partially offset by strengthening reserves for captive programs within specialty commercial.

General liability reserves were increased for the 2013 to 2016 accident years on a class of business that insures service and maintenance contractors. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in recent accident year reserves for other middle market general liability reserves.
Package business reserves were reduced for accident years 2013 and prior largely due to reducing the Company’s estimate of allocated loss adjustment expenses incurred to settle the claims.
Bond business reserves increased for customs bonds written between 2000 and 2010 which was partly offset by a reduction in reserves for recent accident years as reported losses for commercial and contract surety have emerged favorably.
Automobile liability reserves within Commercial Lines were increased in small commercial and large national accounts for the 2013 to 2016 accident years, driven by higher frequency of more severe accidents, including litigated claims
Asbestos and environmental reserves were unchanged as $285 of adverse development arising from the fourth quarter 2017 comprehensive annual review was offset by a $285 recoverable from NICO. For additional information related to the adverse development cover with NICO, see Note 8 - Reinsurance and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Catastrophes reserves were reduced primarily due to lower estimates of 2016 wind and hail event losses and a decrease in losses on a 2015 wildfire.
Uncollectible reinsurance reserves decreased as a result of giving greater weight to favorable collectibility experience in recent calendar periods in estimating future collections.
Adverse Development Covers
The Company has an adverse development cover reinsurance agreement with NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to reinsure loss development after 2016 on substantially all of the Company’s asbestos and environmental reserves (the “A&E ADC”). Under the A&E ADC, the Company paid a reinsurance premium of $650 for NICO to assume adverse net loss reserve development up to $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion including reserves for A&E exposure for accident years prior to 1986 that are reported in Property & Casualty Other Operations ("Run-off A&E") and reserves for A&E exposure for accident years 1986 and subsequent from policies underwritten prior to 2016 that are reported in ongoing Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. The $650 reinsurance premium was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO’s claim payment obligations to the Company. The Company has retained the risk of collection on amounts due from other third-party reinsurers and continues to be responsible for claims handling and other administrative services, subject to certain conditions. The A&E ADC covers substantially all the Company’s A&E reserve development up to the reinsurance limit.
Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, net adverse A&E reserve development after December 31, 2016 will result in an offsetting reinsurance recoverable up to the $1.5 billion limit.  Cumulative ceded losses up to the $650 reinsurance premium

F-52

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

paid are recognized as a dollar-for-dollar offset to direct losses incurred.  Cumulative ceded losses exceeding the $650 reinsurance premium paid would result in a deferred gain. The deferred gain would be recognized over the claim settlement period in the proportion of the amount of cumulative ceded losses collected from the reinsurer to the estimated ultimate reinsurance recoveries. Consequently, until periods when the deferred gain is recognized as a benefit to earnings, cumulative adverse development of asbestos and environmental claims after December 31, 2016 in excess of $650 may result in significant charges against earnings. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has incurred $640 in cumulative adverse development on asbestos and environmental reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty with NICO.
Immediately after closing on the acquisition of Navigators Group, effective May 23, 2019, the Company purchased the Navigators ADC, an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance agreement covering adverse reserve development, from NICO on behalf of Navigators Insurers. Under the Navigators ADC, the Navigators Insurers paid

NICO a reinsurance premium of $91 in exchange for reinsurance coverage of $300 of adverse net loss reserve development that attaches $100 above the Navigators Insurers' existing net loss and allocated loss adjustment reserves as of December 31, 2018 subject to the treaty of $1.816 billion for accidents and losses prior to December 31, 2018.
As of December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded a reinsurance recoverable under the Navigators ADC of $107 as estimated ceded loss development on the 2018 and prior accident year reserves of $207 exceed the $100 deductible. While the reinsurance recoverable is $107, the Company has also recorded a $16 deferred gain within other liabilities since, under retroactive reinsurance accounting, ceded losses in excess of the $91 of ceded premium paid must be recognized as a deferred gain. As the Company has ceded $107 of the $300 available limit, there is $193 of remaining limit available as of December 31, 2019.

[1] Asbestos and environmental and other operations include asbestos, environmental and other latent exposures not foreseen when coverages were written, including, but not limited to, potential liability for pharmaceutical products, silica, talcum powder, head injuries, lead paint, construction defects, molestation and other long-tail liabilities. These reserve lines do not have significant paid or incurred loss development for the most recent ten accident years and therefore do not have loss development displayed in triangles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The reserve lines in the above table and the loss triangles that follow represent the significant lines of business for which the Company regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels. These reserve lines differ from the reserve lines reported on a statutory basis, as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). The cumulative incurred losses displayed in the above table include the full reinsurance benefit of ceding $107 of losses to the Navigators ADC even though $16 of that benefit has been recorded as a deferred gain within other liabilities and recognized as a charge to earnings in 2019 within incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses included in the consolidated statement of operations. The $107 of Navigators Insurers losses ceded to the Navigators ADC included in the following triangles $28 for general liability, $25 for professional liability, $13 for assumed reinsurance, $12 for commercial auto, $9 for marine and $8 for commercial property and included $12 for older accident years and lines of business that are not in the following triangles.
The following loss triangles present historical loss development for incurred and paid claims by accident year, including loss development on Navigators Insurers reserves prior to and after the May 23, 2019 acquisition date. Because the loss triangles include pre-acquisition date changes in ultimate incurred loss estimates for Navigators Insurers’ reserves, changes in reserve development evident in the incurred loss triangles may differ from prior accident year development recorded by the Company as shown in the (Favorable) Unfavorable Prior Accident Year Development table above as that only includes changes in Navigators Insurers’ reserves post acquisition. In addition, the incurred losses triangles include reserve development on both catastrophe and non-catastrophe claims whereas the (Favorable) Unfavorable Prior Accident Year Development table above shows the total amount of catastrophe reserve development across all lines of business on a single line.
Triangles are limited to the number of years for which claims incurred typically remain outstanding, not exceeding ten years. Short-tail lines, which represent claims generally expected to be paid within a few years, have three years of claim development displayed. For marine, commercial property, professional liability and assumed reinsurance lines, the Company has provided eight years of claims development as data for earlier periods was not available for the Lloyds syndicate. IBNR reserves shown in loss triangles include reserve for incurred but not reported claims as well as reserves for expected development on reported claims. Incurred and cumulative paid losses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been converted into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates as of December 31, 2019.

Property and casualty reserves, including IBNR reserves
The Company estimates ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses by accident year. IBNR represents the excess of estimated ultimate loss reserves over case reserves. The process to estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses is an integral part of the Company's reserve setting. Reserves for allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are generally established separate from the reserves for losses.
Reserves for losses are set by line of business within the reporting segments. Case reserves are established by a claims handler on each individual claim and are adjusted as new information becomes known during the course of handling the claim. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge over a long period of time are referred to as long-tail lines of business. Lines of business for which reported losses emerge more quickly are

referred to as short-tail lines of business. The Company’s shortest tail lines of business are homeowners, commercial property and automobile physical damage. The longest tail lines of business include workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability. For short-tail lines of business, emergence of paid loss and case reserves is credible and likely indicative of ultimate losses. For long-tail lines of business, emergence of paid losses and case reserves is less credible in the early periods after a given accident year and, accordingly, may not be indicative of ultimate losses.
The Company’s reserving actuaries regularly review reserves for both current and prior accident years using the most current claim data. A variety of actuarial methods and judgments are used for most lines of business to arrive at selections of estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses. The reserve selections incorporate input, as appropriate, from claims

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

personnel, pricing actuaries and operating management about reported loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates.
For both short-tail and long-tail lines of business, an expected loss ratio is used to record initial reserves. This expected loss ratio is determined by starting with the average loss ratio of recent prior accident years and adjusting that ratio for the effect of expected changes to earned pricing, loss frequency and severity, mix of business, ceded reinsurance and other factors. For short-tail lines, IBNR for the current accident year is initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period, earned premium for the period and the proportion of losses expected to be reported in future calendar periods for the current accident period. For long-tailed lines, IBNR reserves for the current accident year are initially recorded as the product of the expected loss ratio for the period and the earned premium for the period, less reported losses for the period. For certain short-tailed lines of business, IBNR amounts in the above loss development triangles are negative due to anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries on paid losses.
As losses for a given accident year emerge or develop in subsequent periods, reserving actuaries use other methods to estimate ultimate unpaid losses in addition to the expected loss ratio method. These primarily include paid and reported loss development methods, frequency/severity techniques and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method (a combination of the expected loss ratio and paid development or reported development method). Within any one line of business, the methods that are given more weight vary based primarily on the maturity of the accident year, the mix of business and the particular internal and external influences impacting the claims experience or the methods. The output of the reserve reviews are reserve estimates that are referred to as the “actuarial indication”.
Paid development and reported development techniques are used for most lines of business though more weight is given to the reported development method for some of the long-tailed lines like general liability. In addition, for long-tailed lines of business, the Company relies on the expected loss ratio method for immature accident years. Frequency/severity techniques are used predominantly for professional liability and are also used for automobile liability. The Berquist-Sherman technique is also used

for automobile liability, marine and assumed reinsurance. For most lines, reserves for allocated loss adjustment expenses ("ALAE", or those expenses related to specific claims) are analyzed using paid development techniques and an analysis of the relationship between ALAE and loss payments. For most of the lines acquired through the Navigators Group book of business, loss and ALAE are reviewed on a combined basis. Reserves for ULAE are determined using the expected cost per claim year and the anticipated claim closure pattern as well as the ratio of paid ULAE to paid losses.
In the final step of the reserve review process, senior reserving actuaries and senior management apply their judgment to determine the appropriate level of reserves considering the actuarial indications and other factors not contemplated in the actuarial indications. Those factors include, but are not limited to, the assessed reliability of key loss trends and assumptions used in the current actuarial indications, the maturity of the accident year, pertinent trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular line of business, and the improvement or deterioration of actuarial indications. The Company also considers the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves.
Cumulative number of reported claims
For most property and casualty lines, claim counts represent the number of claim features on a reported claim where a claim feature is each separate coverage for each claimant affected by the claim event.  For example, one car accident that results in two bodily injury claims and one automobile damage liability claim would be counted as three claims within the personal automobile liability triangle. Similarly, a fire that impacts one commercial building may result in multiple claim features due to the potential for claims related to business interruption, structural damage, and loss of the physical contents of the building. Claim features that result in no paid losses are included in the reported claim counts. For some property and casualty lines, such as marine and assumed reinsurance, a claim count represents each reported claim regardless of the number of features. For assumed bordereau business and business written on binders, one claim count is posted for each bordereau received, which could account for multiple claims.

Range of discount rate 2.1 % - 8.0 % 2.1 % - 8.0 % 2.1 % - 8.0 %

Reserves are discounted at rates in effect at the time claims were incurred, ranging from 2.1% for life and disability reserves acquired from Aetna based on interest rates in effect at the acquisition date of November 1, 2017, to 8.0% for the Company’s pre-acquisition reserves for incurral year 1990, and vary by product. Prior year's discount accretion has been calculated as the average reserve balance for the year times the weighted average discount rate.
Re-estimates of prior incurral years reserve in 2019
Group disability- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $340 largely driven by group long-term disability claim incidence lower than prior assumptions and strong recoveries on prior incurral year claims, including the impact of updating long-term disability ("LTD") recovery probabilities to be based on more recent experience. New York Paid Family Leave also experienced favorable claim emergence including an experience refund.
Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $60 largely driven by lower-than-previously expected claim incidence in group life premium waiver.
Re-estimates of prior incurral years reserves in 2018
Group disability- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $230 largely driven by group long-

term disability claim recoveries higher than prior reserve assumptions and, primarily for the 2017 incurral year, claim incidence lower than prior assumptions. Short-term disability also experienced favorable claim recoveries.
Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- Prior period reserve estimates decreased by approximately $90 largely driven by lower-than-previously expected claim incidence inclusive of group life, group life premium waiver, and group accidental death & dismemberment, principally for the 2017 incurral year.
Re-estimates of prior incurral years reserves in 2017
Group disability- Prior period estimates decreased by approximately $125 driven by group long-term disability favorable claim incidence for incurral year 2016 and claim recoveries higher than prior reserve assumptions.
Group life and accident (including group life premium waiver)- Contributing to an approximately $60 decrease in prior period reserve estimates was favorable claim incidence on group life premium waiver for incurral year 2016.

Group life, disability and accident reserves, including IBNR
The majority of Group Benefits’ reserves are for LTD claimants who are known to be disabled and are currently receiving

benefits. A Disabled Life Reserve ("DLR") is calculated for each LTD claim. The DLR for each claim is the expected present value of all estimated future benefit payments and includes estimates of claim recovery, investment yield, and offsets from other income, including offsets from Social Security benefits and workers’ compensation. Estimated future benefit payments represent the monthly income benefit that is paid until recovery, death or expiration of benefits. Claim recoveries are estimated based on claim characteristics such as age and diagnosis and represent an estimate of benefits that will terminate, generally as a result of the claimant returning to work or being deemed able to return to work. The DLR also includes a liability for payments to claimants who have not yet been approved for LTD either because they have not yet satisfied the waiting (or elimination) period or because the approval or denial decision has not yet been made. In these cases, the present value of future benefits is reduced for the likelihood of claim denial based on Company experience. For claims recently closed due to recovery, a portion of the DLR is retained for the possibility that the claim reopens upon further evidence of disability.  In addition, a reserve for estimated unpaid claim expenses is included in the DLR.
For incurral years with IBNR claims, estimates of ultimate losses are made by applying completion factors to the dollar amount of claims reported or expected depending on the market segment. IBNR represents estimated ultimate losses less both DLR and cumulative paid amounts for all reported claims. Completion factors are derived using standard actuarial techniques using triangles that display historical claim count emergence by incurral month. These estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends and other factors expected to cause a change in claim emergence. The IBNR includes an estimate of unpaid claim expenses, including a provision for the cost of initial set-up of the claim once reported.
For all products, including LTD, there is a period generally ranging from two to twelve months, depending on the product and market segment, where emerged claim information for an incurral year is not yet credible enough to be a basis for an IBNR projection.  In these cases, the ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment

F-72

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

expenses are estimated using earned premium multiplied by an expected loss ratio.
The Company also records reserves for future death benefits under group term life policies that provide for premiums to be waived in the event the insured is unable to work due to disability and has satisfied an elimination period, which is typically nine months (premium waiver reserves). The death benefit reserve for these group life premium waiver claims is estimated for a known disabled claimant equal to the present value of expected future cash outflows (typically a lump sum face amount payable at death plus claim expenses) with separate estimates for claimant recovery (when no death benefit is payable) and for death before recovery or benefit expiry (when death benefit is payable). The IBNR for premium waiver death benefits is estimated with standard actuarial development methods.
In addition, the Company also records reserves for group term life, accidental death & dismemberment, short term disability, and

other group products that have short claim payout periods. For these products, reserves are determined using paid or reported actuarial development methods. The resulting claim triangles produce a completion pattern and estimate of ultimate loss. IBNR for these lines of business equals the estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses less the amount of paid or reported claims depending on whether the paid or reported development method was used. Estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and are adjusted for current trends or other factors that affect the development pattern.
Cumulative number of reported claims
For group life, disability and accident coverages, claim counts include claims that are approved, pending approval and terminated and exclude denied claims. Due to the nature of the claims, one claimant represents one event.

[1] In April 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement expiring February 15, 2027 to effectively convert the variable interest payments for this debenture into fixed interest payments of approximately 4.39%.

--- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2] This amount includes unamortized discount of $76 and $78 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on the 6.1% Notes, due 2041.

The effective interest rate on the 6.1% senior notes due 2041 is 7.9%. The effective interest rate on the remaining notes does not differ materially from the stated rate. The Company incurred interest expense of $259, $298 and $316 on debt for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Shelf Registrations
On May 17, 2019, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission an automatic shelf registration statement (Registration No. 333-231592) for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities. The registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered: debt securities, junior subordinated debt securities, guarantees, preferred stock,

common stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, and stock purchase units. In that The Hartford is a well-known seasoned issuer, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, the registration statement went effective immediately upon filing and The Hartford may offer and sell an unlimited amount of securities under the registration statement during the three-year life of the registration statement.
Senior Notes
On January 15, 2019, The Hartford repaid at maturity the  $413 principal amount of its 6.0% senior notes.
In the Navigators Group acquisition, the Company assumed $265 par value 5.75% Senior notes due on October 15, 2023 with a fair value of $284 as of the acquisition date.
On August 19, 2019, The Hartford issued $600 of 2.8% senior notes (“2.8% Notes”) due August 19, 2029 and $800 of 3.6% senior notes (“3.6% Notes”) due August 19, 2049 for net proceeds of approximately $1.38 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses. Under both senior note issuances, interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on August 19 and February 19, commencing February 19, 2020. The Hartford, at its option, can redeem the 2.8% Notes and the 3.6% Notes at any time, in whole or part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed or a make-whole amount based on a comparable maturity US Treasury plus a basis point spread, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, except the make-whole amount is not applicable within the final three months of maturity for the 2.8% Notes and the final six months of maturity for the 3.6% Notes. The spread over the comparable maturity US Treasury for determining the make-whole amount is 20 and 25 basis points for the 2.8% Notes and 3.6% Notes, respectively.
After receiving proceeds from the issuance of the 2.8% Notes and 3.6% Notes, in third quarter 2019, The Hartford repaid $265 of 5.75% senior notes due 2023 that had been assumed in the Navigators Group acquisition and $800 of 5.125% senior notes due 2022 of the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $90.

--- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5] In April 2017, the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement expiring February 15, 2027 to effectively convert the interest payments for the 3 Month LIBOR + 2.125% debenture into fixed interest payments of approximately 4.39%.

The debentures are unsecured, subordinated and junior in right of payment and upon liquidation to all of the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness. In addition, the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including obligations to policyholders. The debentures do not limit the Company’s or the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, including debt that ranks senior in right of payment and upon liquidation to the debentures.
The Company has the right to defer interest payments for up to a consecutive ten years without giving rise to an event of default. Deferred interest will continue to accrue and will accrue additional interest at the then applicable interest rate. If the Company defers interest payments, the Company generally may not make payments on or redeem or purchase any shares of its capital stock or any of its debt securities or guarantees that rank upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up equally with or junior to the debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.
The 7.875% and 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debentures may be redeemed in whole prior to the call date upon certain tax or rating agency events, at a price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount being redeemed and the applicable make-whole amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may elect to redeem the 7.875% and 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debentures in whole or in part on or after the call date for the principal amount being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.
In connection with the offering of the 3 Month LIBOR plus 2.125% debenture, the Company entered into a Replacement Capital Covenant ("RCC") for the benefit of holders of one or more designated series of the Company's indebtedness, initially the Company's 4.3% notes due 2043. Under the terms of the

RCC, if the Company redeems the debenture any time prior to February 12, 2047 (or such earlier date on which the RCC terminates by its terms) it can only do so with the proceeds from the sale of certain qualifying replacement securities. The RCC also prohibits the Company from redeeming all or any portion of the notes on or prior to February 15, 2022.
In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, by the end of 2021, it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to report information used to set LIBOR, which could result in LIBOR no longer being published after 2021 or a determination by regulators that LIBOR is no longer representative of its underlying market. The Company continues to monitor and assess the potential impacts of the discontinuation of LIBOR on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures.

Revolving Credit Facilities
The Company has a senior unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) that provides up to $750 of unsecured credit through March 29, 2023. Revolving loans from the Credit Facility may be in multiple currencies. U.S. dollar loans will bear interest at a floating rate equivalent to an indexed rate depending on the type of borrowing and a basis point spread based on The Hartford's credit rating and will mature no later than March 29, 2023. Letters of credit issued from the Credit Facility bear a fee based on The Hartford's credit rating and expire no later than March 29, 2024. The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, excluding AOCI, of $9 billion, limit the ratio of senior debt to capitalization, excluding AOCI, at 35% and meet other customary covenants. The Credit Facility is for general corporate purposes.
As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding, $5 in letters of credit were issued under the Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.
Lloyd's Letter of Credit
As a result of the acquisition of Navigators Group, The Hartford has two letter of credit facility agreements: the Club Facility and the Bilateral Facility, which are used to provide a portion of the capital requirements at Lloyd's. In November of 2019, the Company issued £11 million of letters of credit under the Bilateral Facility. As of December 31, 2019, uncollateralized letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $165 and £60 million were outstanding under the Club Facility and £18 was outstanding under the Bilateral Facility. As of December 31, 2019, the Bilateral Facility has unused capacity of $1 for issuance of additional letters of credit. Among other covenants, the Club

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Facility and Bilateral Facility contain financial covenants regarding tangible net worth and Funds at Lloyd's ("FAL"). As of December 31, 2019, Navigators Group was in compliance with all financial covenants.
Commercial Paper
As of December 31, 2019, the Hartford's maximum borrowings available under its commercial paper program was $750 and there was no commercial paper outstanding. The Company is dependent upon market conditions to access short-term financing through the issuance of commercial paper to investors.
Collateralized Advances with Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
The Company’s subsidiaries, Hartford Fire Insurance Company (“Hartford Fire”) and HLA, are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”). Membership allows these subsidiaries access to collateralized advances, which may be short- or long-term with fixed or variable rates. FHLBB membership required the purchase of member stock and requires additional member stock ownership of 3% or 4% of any amount

borrowed. Acceptable forms of collateral include real estate backed fixed maturities and mortgage loans and the amount of advances that can be taken is limited to a percentage of the fair value of the assets that ranges from a high of 97% for US government-backed fixed maturities maturing within 3 years to a low of 40% for A-rated commercial mortgage-backed fixed maturities maturing in 5 years or more. In its consolidated balance sheets, The Hartford presents the liability for advances taken based on use of the funds with advances for general corporate purposes presented in short- or long-term debt and advances to earn incremental investment income presented in other liabilities, consistent with other collateralized financing transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements. The Connecticut Department of Insurance permits Hartford Fire and HLA to pledge up to $1.2 billion and $0.6 billion in qualifying assets, respectively, without prior approval, to secure FHLBB advances in 2020. The pledge limit is determined annually based on statutory admitted assets and capital and surplus of Hartford Fire and HLA, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019, there were no advances outstanding under the FHLBB facility.

14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Management evaluates each contingent matter separately. A loss is recorded if probable and reasonably estimable. Management establishes liabilities for these contingencies at its “best estimate,” or, if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other, the Company records an estimated liability at the low end of the range of losses.
Litigation
The Hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The Hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties in the following discussion under the caption “Asbestos and Environmental Claims,” management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of The Hartford.
The Hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. In addition to the matter described below, these actions include putative class actions seeking certification of a state or national class. Such putative class actions have alleged, for example, underpayment of claims or improper sales or underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies, such as personal and commercial automobile, property, disability, life and inland marine. The Hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims or other allegedly unfair or improper business practices. Like many other insurers, The Hartford also has been joined in actions by asbestos plaintiffs

asserting, among other things, that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos and that insurers committed unfair trade practices by asserting defenses on behalf of their policyholders in the underlying asbestos cases. Management expects that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such lawsuits, after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses, will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of The Hartford. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, the outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
Run-off Asbestos and Environmental Claims
The Company continues to receive A&E claims. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by people who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs.
The vast majority of the Company's exposure to A&E relates to Run-off A&E, reported within the P&C Other Operations segment. In addition, since 1986, the Company has written asbestos and environmental exposures under general liability policies and pollution liability under homeowners policies, which are reported in the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments.
Prior to 1986, the Company wrote several different categories of insurance contracts that may cover A&E claims. First, the Company wrote primary policies providing the first layer of coverage in an insured’s liability program. Second, the Company wrote excess and umbrella policies providing higher layers of coverage for losses that exhaust the limits of underlying coverage.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

Third, the Company acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of those risks assumed by other insurers writing primary, excess, umbrella and reinsurance coverages.
Significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid gross losses and expenses related to environmental and particularly asbestos claims. The degree of variability of gross reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures.
In the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate loss development patterns, plaintiffs’ expanding theories of liability, the risks inherent in major litigation, and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines. Furthermore, over time, insurers, including the Company, have experienced significant changes in the rate at which asbestos claims are brought, the claims experience of particular insureds, and the value of claims, making predictions of future exposure from past experience uncertain. Plaintiffs and insureds also have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings, including “pre-packaged” bankruptcies, to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers. In addition, some policyholders have asserted new classes of claims for coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply. Further uncertainties include insolvencies of other carriers and unanticipated developments pertaining to the Company’s ability to recover reinsurance for A&E claims. Management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future.
In the case of the reserves for environmental exposures, factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include expanding theories of liability and damages, the risks inherent in major litigation, inconsistent decisions concerning the existence and scope of coverage for environmental claims, and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured.
The reporting pattern for assumed reinsurance claims, including those related to A&E claims, is much longer than for direct claims. In many instances, it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder’s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims. The delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves.
It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their effect on the future development of A&E claims.
Given the factors described above, the Company believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for A&E exposures. For this reason, the Company principally relies on exposure-based analysis to estimate the ultimate costs of these claims, both gross and net of reinsurance, and regularly evaluates new account information in assessing its potential A&E exposures. The Company supplements this exposure-based analysis with evaluations of the Company’s historical direct net loss and expense paid and reported experience, and net loss and expense paid and reported experience by calendar and/or report year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and reported activity.

While the Company believes that its current A&E reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not estimable now, could be material to The Hartford’s consolidated operating results and liquidity.
For its Run-off A&E, as of December 31, 2019, the Company reported $874 of net asbestos reserves and $120 of net environmental reserves. While the Company believes that its current Run-off A&E reserves are appropriate, significant uncertainties limit our ability to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses. The ultimate liabilities, thus, could exceed the currently recorded reserves, and any such additional liability, while not reasonably estimable now, could be material to The Hartford's consolidated operating results and liquidity.
The Company’s A&E ADC reinsurance agreement with NICO reinsures substantially all A&E reserve development for 2016 and prior accident years, including Run-off A&E and A&E reserves included in Commercial Lines and Personal Lines. The A&E ADC has a coverage limit of $1.5 billion above the Company’s existing net A&E reserves as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1.7 billion. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has incurred $640 in cumulative adverse development on A&E reserves that have been ceded under the A&E ADC treaty with NICO, leaving $860 of coverage available for future adverse net reserve development, if any. Cumulative adverse development of A&E claims for accident years 2016 and prior could ultimately exceed the $1.5 billion treaty limit in which case any adverse development in excess of the treaty limit would be absorbed as a charge to earnings by the Company. In these scenarios, the effect of these charges could be material to the Company’s consolidated operating results and liquidity. For more information on the A&E ADC, refer to Note 11, Reserve for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Unfunded Commitments
As of December 31, 2019, the Company has outstanding commitments totaling $1,258, of which $852 is committed to fund limited partnership and other alternative investments, which may be called by the partnership during the commitment period to fund the purchase of new investments and partnership expenses. Additionally, $191 of the outstanding commitments relate to various funding obligations associated with private debt and equity securities. The remaining outstanding commitments of $215 relate to mortgage loans. Of the $1,258 in total outstanding commitments, $130 are related to mortgage loan commitments which the Company can cancel unconditionally.

Guaranty Funds and Other Insurance-Related Assessments
In all states, insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of a guaranty fund. In most states, in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state, the guaranty funds may assess its members to pay covered claims of the insolvent

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

insurers. Assessments are based on each member's proportionate share of written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer was engaged. Assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of the premiums written per year depending on the state. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets, while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process.
Liabilities for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated, and when the event obligating the Company to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for guaranty funds and other insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 the liability balance was $89 and $97, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 amounts related to premium tax offsets of $2 and $2, respectively, were included in other assets.

Derivative Commitments
Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and, in certain instances, enable the counterparties positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2019 was $81. For this $81, the legal entities have

posted collateral of $77 in the normal course of business. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2019, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2019, a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would require an additional $5 of assets to be posted as collateral. additional collateral that we would post, if required, would be primarily in the form of U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury notes and government agency securities.

Guarantees
In the ordinary course of selling businesses or entities to third parties, the Company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising subsequent to the closing due to breaches of representations and warranties with respect to the business or entity being sold or with respect to covenants and obligations of the Company and/or its subsidiaries. These obligations are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. The Company does not expect to make any payments on these guarantees and is not carrying any liabilities associated with these guarantees.
The Hartford has guaranteed the obligations of certain life, accident and health and annuity contracts of the life and annuity business written by Hartford Life Insurance Company between 1990 and 1997 and written by Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company between 1993 and 2009. After the sale of this business in May 2018, the purchaser indemnified the Company for any liability arising under the guarantees. The guarantees have no limitation as to maximum potential future payments. The Hartford has not recorded a liability and the likelihood for any payments under these guarantees is remote.

15. EQUITY

Capital Purchase Program ("CPP") Warrants
CPP warrants were issued in 2009 as part of a program established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The CPP warrants expired on June 26, 2019.
The declaration of common stock dividends by the Company in excess of a threshold triggered a provision in the Company's warrant agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon resulting in adjustments to the CPP warrant exercise price and the number of shares deliverable for each warrant exercised (“Warrant Share Number”). Accordingly, the CPP warrant exercise price was$8.836 and $8.999 and the Warrant Share Number was 1.1 and 1.0 as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The exercise price was settled by the Company

withholding the number of common shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants equal to the value of the aggregate exercise price of the warrants so exercised determined by reference to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the trading day on which the warrants were exercised and notice was delivered to the warrant agent. CPP warrant exercises were 1.9 million, 0.3 million and 1.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Equity Repurchase Program
In February, 2019, the Company announced a 1.0 billion share repurchase authorization by the Board of Directors which is effective through December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $800 remaining capacity under the equity repurchase program. Any repurchase of shares under the equity repurchase program is dependent on market conditions and other factors.

F-78

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

During the period January 1, 2020 to February 19, 2020, the Company repurchased approximately 1.4 million common shares for $82.
Preferred Stock
On November 6, 2018, the Company issued 13.8 million depositary shares each representing 1/1000th interest in a share of the Company’s 6.0% Series G non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) with a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share), for net cash proceeds of $334. The Preferred Stock is perpetual and has no maturity date. Dividends are recorded when declared. Dividends are payable, if declared, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of February, May, August and November of each year. If a dividend is not declared and paid or made payable on all outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock for the latest completed dividend period, no dividends may be paid or declared on The Hartford’s common stock and The Hartford may not purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire its common stock.
The Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option in whole or in part, on or after November 15, 2023 at a redemption price of $25,000 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period. Prior to November 15, 2023, the Preferred Stock is redeemable at the Company’s option, in whole but not in part, within 90 days of the occurrence of (a) a rating agency event at a redemption price equal to $25,500 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a rating agency changes its criteria used to assign equity credit to securities like the Preferred Stock; or (b) a regulatory capital event at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus unpaid dividends attributable to the current dividend period in circumstances where a capital regulator such as a state insurance regulator changes or proposes to change capital adequacy rules.

Statutory Results
The U.S. domestic insurance subsidiaries of The Hartford prepare their statutory financial statements in conformity with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the applicable state insurance department which vary materially from U.S. GAAP. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include publications of the NAIC, as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. The differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP vary between domestic and foreign jurisdictions. The principal differences are that statutory financial statements do not reflect deferred policy acquisition costs and limit deferred income taxes, predominately use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the NAIC for life benefit reserves, generally carry bonds at amortized cost, and present reinsurance assets and liabilities net of reinsurance. For reporting purposes, statutory capital and surplus is referred to collectively as "statutory capital".

Total $ 12,852 $ 9,842

Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Company's U.S. insurance companies' states of domicile impose risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. All of the Company's operating insurance subsidiaries had RBC ratios in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable insurance regulations.
Similar to the RBC ratios that are employed by U.S. insurance insurance subsidiaries have capital levels in excess of the minimum levels required by the applicable regulatory authorities.
Dividend Restrictions
Dividends to HFSG Holding Company from its insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance regulation. Upon the acquisition of Navigators Group, the Company’s principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium.
The payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of Connecticut. These laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend, which, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s statutory policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year or (ii) net income (or net gain from operations, if such company is a life insurance

company) for the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of December last preceding, in each case determined under Commissioner.
Property casualty insurers domiciled in New York, including Navigators Insurance Company ("NIC") and Navigators Specialty Insurance Company ("NSIC"), generally may not, without notice to approval of the Navigators Group acquisition, and as is common practice, any dividend from NIC and NSIC before May 2021 will require prior approval from the state insurance commissioner.
Corporate members of Lloyd's Syndicates may pay dividends to its parent to the extent of available profits that have been distributed from the syndicate in excess of the FAL capital requirement. The FAL is determined based on the syndicate’s solvency capital requirement of the syndicate under the E.U.'s Solvency II capital adequacy model, plus a Lloyd’s specific economic capital assessment.
Insurers domiciled in the United Kingdom may pay dividends to its parent out of its statutory profits subject to restrictions imposed under U.K. Company law and European Insurance regulation (Solvency II). Belgium domiciled insurers may only pay dividends if, at the end of its previous fiscal year, the total amount of its assets, as reduced by its provisions and debts, are in excess of certain minimum capital thresholds calculated under Belgian law.

The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which The Hartford’s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated (or deemed commercially domiciled) generally contain similar (although in certain instances more restrictive) limitations on the payment of dividends. In addition to statutory limitations on paying dividends, the Company also takes other items into consideration when determining dividends from subsidiaries. These considerations include, but are not limited to, expected earnings and capitalization of the subsidiaries, regulatory capital requirements and liquidity requirements of the individual operating company.
In 2019, the Company received $300 of dividends from HLA, $116 from Hartford Funds and $3 from a run-off HFSG subsidiary. In addition, the Company received $50 of ordinary P&C dividends that were subsequently contributed to a run-off P&C subsidiary. Excluding the dividends that were subsequently contributed to a P&C subsidiary, there were no net dividends paid by P&C subsidiaries to HFSG Holding Company in 2019.
The Company’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have dividend capacity of $1.6 billion for 2020, with $850 to $900 of net dividends expected in 2020.
HLA has dividend capacity of $534 in 2020 with $300 to $350 of dividends expected in 2020.
There are no current restrictions on HFSG Holding Company's ability to pay dividends to its stockholders.
Restricted Net Assets
The Company's insurance subsidiaries had net assets of $15.6 billion, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, that were restricted from payment to the HFSG Holding Company, without prior regulatory approval at December 31, 2019.

16. INCOME TAXES

Income Tax Expense
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions, as applicable. Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $2,644, $1,753 and $704 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and income (losses) from foreign operations of $(84), $0 and $19 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Provision for income taxes $ 475 $ 268 $ 985

Included in 2018 is a benefit of $39 related to Tax Reform, primarily due to the elimination of the sequestration fee on alternative minimum tax ("AMT") credits.
Included in 2017 is an expense of $877 due to the effects of Tax Reform, primarily due to the reduction in net deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.
Deferred Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets represent the tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. In lieu of recording a benefit of the tax capital loss on the sale of the life and annuity business, the Company elected to retain tax net operating loss carryovers with an estimated benefit of $477 as of December 31, 2018.
The Company predominantly pays non-income state taxes as a percentage of premiums written which are accounted for as policy acquisition costs. State income taxes were $5, $4 and $5 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and are included in other expenses. The Hartford has not recorded state deferred taxes, including net deferred tax assets from state operating loss carryforwards because the Company does not expect to earn state taxable income to utilize such state tax benefits.

Net Deferred Tax Asset $ 299 $ 1,248

The Company had net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards in the United States and the United Kingdom for which future tax benefits of $77 and $3 , respectively, have been recognized and are included in the table above as a component of the net deferred tax asset for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company also has NOLs of $4 in other foreign jurisdictions for which a full valuation allowance of $4 has been established. Although the Company projects there will be sufficient future taxable income to fully recover the remainder of the NOL carryover for which benefits have been recognized, the Company's estimate of the likely realization may change over time. The U.S. NOL carryovers, if unused, would expire between 2028 and 2036. The foreign NOLs do not expire.
With the exception of the foreign NOLs noted above, a deferred tax valuation allowance has not been recorded because the Company believes the deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considered future taxable temporary difference reversals, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryovers, taxable income in open carry back years and other tax planning strategies. From time to time, tax planning strategies could include holding a portion of debt securities with market value losses until recovery, altering the level of tax exempt securities held, making investments which have specific tax characteristics, and business considerations such as asset-liability matching. Management views such tax planning strategies as prudent and feasible and would implement them, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets.

The entire amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in the period of the release.
In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company recorded a receivable of $5 related to a tax indemnification agreement associated with the life and annuity business sold in May 2018. The receivable is separate from the tax liability and is classified in other assets on the balance sheet.
Other Tax Matters
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as Tax Reform. Tax Reform establishes new tax laws effective January 1, 2018, including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax AMT and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, (3) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, (4) changes to the discounting of statutory reserves for tax purposes, and (5) limitations on NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 though there is no impact to the Company’s current NOL carryforwards.
Related to Tax Reform, the Company recorded a provisional net income tax expense of $877 in the period ending December 31, 2017. This net expense consisted of an $821 reduction of the Company’s deferred tax assets primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and a $56 sequestration fee payable associated with refundable AMT credits.

During 2018, the Company recorded income tax expense of $17 as measurement period adjustments related to Tax Reform due to the filing of the Company's 2017 federal income tax return and completion of the Aetna Group Benefits acquisition. In addition, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $56, reflecting the elimination of the sequestration fee payable. In total, the Company recorded a net income tax benefit from Tax Reform of $39 in 2018.
In July 2019, the Company received a $421 refund of alternative minimum tax AMT credits. As of December 31, 2019 the Company had remaining AMT credit carryovers of $410 which are reflected as a current income tax receivable within other assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. AMT credits may be used to offset a regular tax liability for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017, and are refundable at an amount equal to 50 percent of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Any remaining credits not used against regular tax liability are refundable in the 2021 tax year to be realized in 2022. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company offset $11 of regular tax liability with AMT credits.
The federal audits for the Company have been completed through 2013, and the Company is not currently under federal examination for any open years. The statute of limitations is closed through the 2015 tax year with the exception of NOL carryforwards utilized in open tax years. Navigators Group is currently under federal audit for the 2016 year and has completed examinations through 2015. Management believes that adequate provision has been made in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for any potential adjustments that may result from tax examinations and other tax-related matters for all open tax years.
The Company classifies interest and penalties (if applicable) as income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognized net interest income of $1 for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $0 for the years ended 2018 and 2017. The Company had no interest payable as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The Company does not believe it would be subject to any penalties in any open tax years and, therefore, has not recorded any accrual for penalties.

Substantially all U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in The Hartford Investment and Savings Plan under which designated contributions may be invested in a variety of investments, including up to 10% in a fund consisting largely of common stock of The Hartford. The Company's contributions include a non-elective contribution of 2.0% of eligible

compensation and a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution of up to 6.0% of eligible compensation contributed by the employee each pay period. The Company also maintains a non-qualified savings plan, The Hartford Excess Savings Plan, with the dollar-for-dollar matching contributions of employee compensation in excess of the amount that can be contributed under the tax-qualified Investment and Savings Plan. An employee's eligible compensation includes overtime and bonuses but for the

Additionally, The Hartford has established defined contribution pension plans for certain employees of the Company’s international subsidiaries. The cost to The Hartford for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 for these plans was immaterial.
Post Retirement Benefit Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plan- The Company maintains The Hartford Retirement Plan for U.S. Employees, a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (“Pension Plan”) that covers substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2013. The Company also maintains non-qualified pension plans to provide retirement benefits previously accrued that are in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.
The Pension Plan includes two benefit formulas, both of which are frozen: a final average pay formula (for which all accruals ceased as of December 31, 2008) and a cash balance formula for which benefit accruals ceased as of December 31, 2012, although interest will continue to accrue to existing cash balance formula account balances. Employees who were participants as of December 31, 2012 continue to earn vesting credit with respect to their frozen accrued benefits if they continue to work. The interest crediting rate on the cash balance plan is the greater of the average annual yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury Securities or 3.3%. The Hartford Excess Pension Plan II, the Company's non-qualified excess pension benefit plan for certain highly compensated employees, is also frozen.
Group Retiree Health Plan- The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees. The Company’s contribution for health care benefits will depend upon the retiree’s date of retirement and years of service. In addition, the plan has a defined dollar cap for certain retirees which limits average Company contributions. The Hartford has prefunded a portion of the health care obligations through a trust fund where such prefunding can be accomplished on a tax effective basis. Beginning January 1, 2017, for retirees 65 and older who were participating in the Retiree PPO Medical Plan, the Company funds the cost of medical and dental health care benefits through contributions to a Health Reimbursement Account and covered individuals can access a variety of insurance plans from a health care exchange. Effective January 1, 2002, Company-subsidized retiree medical, retiree dental and retiree life insurance benefits were eliminated for employees with original hire dates with the Company on or after January 1, 2002. The Company also amended its postretirement medical, dental and life insurance coverage plans to no longer provide subsidized coverage for employees who retired on or after January 1, 2014.
Assumptions
Pursuant to accounting principles related to the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations to employees under its various benefit plans, the Company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to calculate the related liabilities and expenses each period. The two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension and other postretirement expense under the defined benefit pension plan and group retiree health plan are the discount rate and the

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The assumed discount rates and yield curve is based on high-quality fixed income investments consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows. Based on all available market and industry information, it was determined that 3.33% and 3.15% were the appropriate discount rates as of December 31, 2019 to calculate the Company’s pension and other postretirement obligations, respectively.
The expected long-term rate of return considers the actual compound rates of return earned over various historical time periods. The Company also considers the investment volatility, duration and total returns for various time periods related to the characteristics of the pension obligation, which are influenced by the Company's workforce demographics. In addition, for the pension plan, the Company anticipates an allocation of approximately 60% in fixed income securities and 40% in non fixed income securities (global equities, hedge funds and private market alternatives) to derive an expected long-term rate of return. For the other post-retirement plans, the Company anticipates an allocation of approximately 70% in fixed income securities and 30% in non fixed income securities. Based upon these analyses, management determined the long-term rate of return assumption to be 6.45% and 6.00% for the Company's pension and other postretirement obligations, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 6.60% for both pension and other postretirement obligations for the year ended December 31, 2018. To determine the Company's 2020 expense, the Company has assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.00% and 5.60% for the Company's pension and other post retirement obligations, respectively.

Changes in assumptions in 2019 primarily included a $508 increase in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of a decrease in the discount rate from 4.35% as of the December 31, 2018 valuation to 3.33% as of the December 31, 2019 valuation. Changes in assumptions in 2018 included a $281 decrease in the benefit obligation for pension benefits as a result of an increase in the discount rate from 3.73% as of the December 31, 2017 valuation to 4.35% as of the December 31, 2018 valuation.
The cash balance plan pension benefit obligation was $420 and $412 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The interest crediting rate was 3.30% in 2019, 2018, and 2017.
On June 30, 2017, the Company transferred invested assets and cash from plan assets to purchase a group annuity contract that transferred approximately $1.6 billion of the Company's outstanding pension obligations related to certain U.S. retirees, terminated vested participants and beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, the Company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750. The settlement charge was included in the corporate category for segment reporting.

The fair value of assets for pension benefits, and hence the funded status, presented in the table above excludes assets of $161 and $139 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, held in rabbi trusts and designated for the non-qualified pension plans. The assets do not qualify as plan assets; however, the assets are available to pay benefits for certain retired, terminated and active participants. Such assets are available to the Company’s general creditors in the event of insolvency. The rabbi trust assets consist of equity and fixed income investments. To the extent the fair value of these rabbi trusts were included in the table above, pension plan assets would have been $4,075 and $3,483 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the funded status of pension benefits would have been $(423) and $(517) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) and Other Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
As a result of the pension settlement, in 2017, the Company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750 ($488 net of tax) and a reduction to stockholders' equity of $144.
In connection with this transaction, the Company made a contribution of $280 in September 2017 to the U.S. qualified pension plan in order to maintain the plan's pre-transaction funded status.
Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted the full yield curve approach in the estimation of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and non-qualified pension plans and the postretirement benefit plan. The full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that are used in its determination of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. The change has been made to provide a better estimate of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by better aligning projected benefit cash flows with corresponding spot rates on the yield curve rather than using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve as had been done historically.
This change does not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations as the change in the interest cost in net income is completely offset in the actuarial (gain) loss reported for the period in other comprehensive income. The change reduced the before tax interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by $32 for the year ended December 31, 2017. The discount rate being used to measure interest cost was 3.58% for the period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 and 3.37% for the period from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 for the qualified pension plan, 3.55% for the non-qualified pension plan, and 3.13% for the postretirement benefit plan. Under the Company's historical estimation approach, the weighted average discount rate for the interest cost component would have been 4.22% for the period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 and 3.92% for the period from July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 for the qualified pension plan, 4.19% for the non-qualified pension plan and 3.97% for the postretirement benefit plan. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, and accordingly, has recognized the effect prospectively beginning in 2017.

Pension Plan Assets
Investment Strategy and Target Allocation
The overall investment strategy of the Pension Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. With respect to asset management, the oversight responsibility of the Pension Plan rests with The Hartford’s Pension Fund Trust and Investment Committee composed of individuals whose responsibilities include establishing overall objectives and the setting of investment policy; selecting appropriate investment options and ranges; reviewing the asset allocation mix and asset allocation targets on a regular basis; and monitoring performance to determine whether or not the rate of return objectives are being met and that policy and guidelines are being followed. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Pension Plan.

Target Asset Allocation

----------------------- ------------- -------------------------- ------- ------- -- - -- -

 Pension Plans Other Postretirement Plans
 Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum
Equity securities 5 % 35 % 15 % 45 %
Fixed income securities 50 % 70 % 55 % 85 %
Alternative assets — % 45 % — % — %

Divergent market performance among different asset classes may, from time to time, cause the asset allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used, as necessary, to bring the allocation within tactical ranges.
The Pension Plan invests in commingled funds and partnerships managed by unaffiliated managers to gain exposure to emerging

markets, equity, hedge funds and other alternative investments. These portfolios encompass multiple asset classes reflecting the current needs of the Pension Plan, the investment preferences and risk tolerance of the Pension Plan and the desired degree of diversification. These asset classes include publicly traded equities, bonds and alternative investments and are made up of individual investments in cash and cash equivalents, equity securities, debt securities, asset-backed securities, mortgage

loans and hedge funds. Hedge fund investments represent a diversified portfolio of partnership investments in a variety of strategies.
In addition, the Company uses U.S. Treasury bond futures contracts and U.S. Treasury STRIPS in a duration overlay program to adjust the duration of Pension Plan assets to better match the duration of the benefit obligation.

Concentration of Risk
In order to minimize risk, the Pension Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments. In addition, the Pension Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed on permissible investment options. Permissible investments include U.S. equity, international equity, alternative asset and fixed income investments including derivative instruments. Permissible derivative instruments include futures contracts, options, swaps, currency forwards, caps or floors and may be used to control risk or enhance return but will not be used for leverage purposes.
Securities specifically prohibited from purchase include, but are not limited to: shares or fixed income instruments issued by The Hartford, short sales of any type within long-only portfolios, non-derivative securities involving the use of margin, leveraged floaters and inverse floaters, including money market obligations, natural resource real properties such as oil, gas or timber and precious metals.
Other than U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the Pension Plan does not have any material exposure to any concentration risk of a single issuer.
Expected Employer Contributions
The Company does not have a 2020 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan.

The Company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2020. The Company will monitor the funded status of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2020 to make this determination.

19. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

The Company's stock-based compensation plans are described below. Shares issued in satisfaction of stock-based compensation may be made available from authorized but unissued shares, shares held by the Company in treasury or from shares purchased in the open market. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company issued shares from treasury in satisfaction of stock-based compensation.
Stock-based compensation expense, included in insurance operating costs and other expenses in the consolidated statement of operations, was as follows:
Stock-Based Compensation Expense

------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------- ---- ---- - --- - - ---

 For the years ended December 31,
 2019 2018 2017
Stock-based compensation plans expense $ 125 $ 130 $ 116
Income tax benefit (21 ) (27 ) (41 )
Excess tax benefit on awards vested, exercised and expired (6 ) (5 ) (15 )
Total stock-based compensation plans expense, net of tax [1] $ 98 $ 98 $ 60

--- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] The increase in stock-based compensation plans expense, net of tax in 2018 is primarily related to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.

The Company did not capitalize any cost of stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2019, the total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $70, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2 years.

In the second quarter of 2018, The Hartford modified the terms of the portion of its outstanding 2016 and 2017 performance share awards that are based on actual versus targeted return on equity over the performance period. The modification eliminated the benefit to return on equity that arose from the charge against earnings in 2017 driven by the effect of the lower corporate income tax rate on the carrying value of net deferred tax assets. This modification had no impact on compensation cost recognized over the vesting period since compensation cost based on the original performance share conditions is projected to be higher than what the cost would be based on the performance share conditions as modified.
Stock Plan
Future stock-based awards may be granted under The Hartford's 2014 Incentive Stock Plan (the "Incentive Stock Plan") other than the Subsidiary Stock Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan described below. The Incentive Stock Plan provides for awards to be granted in the form of non-qualified or incentive stock options qualifying under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock or restricted stock units, or any other form of stock-based award. The maximum number of shares, subject to adjustments set forth in the Incentive Stock Plan, that may be issued to Company employees and third party service providers during the 10-year duration of the Incentive Stock Plan is 12,000,000 shares. If any award under an earlier incentive stock plan is forfeited, terminated, surrendered, exchanged, expires unexercised, or is settled in cash in lieu of stock (including to effect tax withholding) or for the net issuance of a lesser number of shares than the number subject to the award, the shares of stock subject to such award (or the relevant portion thereof) shall be available for

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

awards under the Incentive Stock Plan and such shares shall be added to the maximum limit. As of December 31, 2019, there were 5,268,108 shares available for future issuance.
The fair values of awards granted under the Incentive Stock Plan are measured as of the grant date and expensed ratably over the awards’ vesting periods, generally 3 years. For stock option awards to retirement-eligible employees the Company recognizes the expense over a period shorter than the stated vesting period because the employees receive accelerated vesting upon retirement and therefore the vesting period is considered non-substantive. Beginning with awards granted in 2017, employees with restricted stock units and performance shares receive accelerated vesting upon meeting certain retirement eligibility criteria.
Stock Option Awards
Under the Incentive Stock Plan, options granted have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and an option’s maximum term is not to exceed 10 years. Options generally become exercisable over a period of three years commencing one year from the date of grant. Certain other options become exercisable at the later of three years from the date of grant or upon specified market appreciation of the Company's common shares.

The Company uses a hybrid lattice/Monte-Carlo based option valuation model (the “Plan Valuation Model”) that incorporates the possibility of early exercise of options into the valuation. The Plan Valuation Model also incorporates the Company’s historical termination and exercise experience to determine the option value.
The Plan Valuation Model incorporates ranges of assumptions for inputs, and those ranges are disclosed below. The term structure of volatility is generally constructed utilizing implied volatilities from exchange-traded options, CPP warrants related to the Company’s stock, historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the Plan Valuation Model, and accommodates variations in employee preference and risk-tolerance by segregating the grantee pool into a series of behavioral cohorts and conducting a fair valuation for each cohort individually. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option Plan Valuation Model and represents, in a mathematical sense, the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The aggregate intrinsic value excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative intrinsic value. The weighted average grant-date fair value per share of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019,

Share Awards
Share awards granted under the Incentive Stock Plan and outstanding include restricted stock units and performance shares.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units are share equivalents that are credited with dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents are accumulated and paid in incremental shares when the underlying units vest. Restricted stock are shares of The Hartford's common stock with restrictions as to transferability until vested. Restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are valued equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Generally, restricted stock units vest at the end of or over three years; certain restricted stock units vest at the end of five years. Beginning in 2017, restricted stock units vest at the earlier of an employee's retirement eligibility date or three years. Equity awards granted to non-employee directors generally vest in one year and were made in the form of restricted stock units in 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Performance Shares
Performance shares become payable within a range of 0% to 200% of the number of shares initially granted based upon the attainment of specific performance goals achieved at the end of

or over three years. While most performance shares vest at the end of or over three years, certain performance shares vest at the end of five years. Beginning in 2017, performance shares vest at the earlier of an employee's retirement eligibility date or three years.
Performance share awards that are not dependent on market conditions are valued equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant less a discount for the absence of dividends. Stock-compensation expense for these performance share awards without market conditions is based on a current estimate of the number of awards expected to vest based on the performance level achieved and, therefore, may change during the performance period as new estimates of performance are available.
Other performance share awards or portions thereof have a market condition based upon the Company's total stockholder return relative to a group of peer companies within a period of three years from the date of grant. Stock compensation expense for these performance share awards is based on the number of awards expected to vest as estimated at the grant date and, therefore, does not change for changes in estimated performance. The Company uses a risk neutral Monte-Carlo Plan Valuation Model that incorporates time to maturity, implied volatilities of the Company and the peer companies, and correlations between the Company and the peer companies and interest rates.

respectively, based on actual or estimated performance factors. The Company did not make cash payments in settlement of stock compensation during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Subsidiary Stock Plan
In 2013 the Company established a subsidiary stock-based compensation plan similar to The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan except that it awards non-public subsidiary stock as compensation. The Company recognized stock-based compensation plan expense of $11, $9 and $9 in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for the subsidiary stock plan. Upon employee vesting of subsidiary stock, the Company recognizes a noncontrolling equity interest. Employees are restricted from selling vested subsidiary stock to anyone other than the Company and the Company has discretion on the amount of stock to repurchase. Therefore, the subsidiary stock is classified as equity because it is not mandatorily redeemable. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased $8 in subsidiary stock.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company sponsors The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under this plan, eligible employees of The Hartford purchase common stock of the Company at a discount rate of 5% of the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period. Accordingly, the plan is a non-compensatory plan. Employees purchase a variable number of shares of stock through payroll deductions elected as of the beginning of the offering period. The Company may sell up to 15,400,000 shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2019, there were 4,084,500 shares available for future issuance. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 213,472 shares, 219,661 shares, and 204,533 shares were sold, respectively. The weighted average per share fair value of the discount under the ESPP was $2.82, $2.56 and $2.63 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value is estimated based on the 5% discount off the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period.

20. LEASES

The right-of-use asset as of December 31, 2019 was $191 and is included in property and equipment, net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

21. BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Sale of U.K. business
On May 10, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries, Hartford Financial Products International Limited and Downlands Liability Management Limited, in a cash transaction to Catalina Holdings U.K. Limited, for approximately $272, net of transaction costs. The Company's U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries are included in the P&C Other Operations reporting segment. Revenues and earnings are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Sale of life and annuity business
On May 31, 2018, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hartford Holdings, Inc, completed the sale of its life and annuity business to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial

Group, Pine Brook and J. Safra Group. Under the terms of the sale agreement signed December 3, 2017, the investor group formed a limited partnership, Hopmeadow Holdings LP, that acquired HLI, and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries, for cash of approximately $1.4 billion after a pre-closing dividend to The Hartford of $300. The Hartford received a 9.7% ownership interest in the limited partnership, valued at a cost of $164 as of the sale date. In addition, as part of the terms of the sale agreement, The Hartford reduced its long-term debt by $142 because the debt, which was issued by HLI, was included as part of the sale. Including cash proceeds and the retained equity interest and net of transaction costs, net proceeds for the sale were approximately $1.5 billion. The life and annuity operations met the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations and are reported in the Corporate category through the date of sale.
The Company recognized a loss on sale within discontinued operations of approximately $3.3 billion in 2017 and a reduction in loss on sale of $202 in 2018. The reduction in loss on sale in 2018 primarily resulted from the reclassification to retained earnings of $193 of tax effects stranded in AOCI due to the accounting for Tax Reform and a $141 increase in estimated retained tax benefits, primarily net operating loss carryovers, partially offset by $104 of operating income from discontinued operations during the period up until the closing date and a reclassification of $10 of net unrealized capital gains from AOCI to retained earnings. See Note 1 - Adoption of New Accounting Standards within Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information about the reclassifications from AOCI to retained earnings. The estimated amount of retained net operating loss carryovers depends on the estimated tax basis of the business sold which increased subsequent to the date the Company entered into the sale agreement. At closing, stockholders’ equity was further reduced for the amount of AOCI of the life and annuity business, which was approximately $758, largely consisting of net unrealized gains on investments, net of shadow DAC. The AOCI balance was $1 billion as of December 31, 2017.
Cash inflows and outflows from and to the life and annuity business after closing were immaterial to the overall inflows and

outflows of the Company. Additionally, the revenues and expenses presented in continuing operations related to pre-disposal operations were immaterial.
The Company will continue to manage invested assets of the life and annuity business sold in May 2018 for an initial term of five years and provide transition services for up to 24 months.
The Hartford reported its 9.7% ownership interest in Hopmeadow Holdings LP, which is accounted for under the equity method, in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Hartford recognizes its share of income in other revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations on a three month delay, when financial information from the investee becomes available. The Company recognized $66, before tax, of income in 2019. Cash inflows for dividends received from Hopmeadow Holdings LP were $67 in 2019. Other cash inflows and outflows from and to the life and annuity business after closing were immaterial to the overall inflows and outflows of the Company.

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flow Hedges In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of November 29, 2019, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our ant...

In the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc. Other contractual commitments We also have $4.54 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2019, which is primarily related to network infrastructure and our data center operations. These commitments are primarily due within five years. Legal Matters Beginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking 94 unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages.

['s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

from limited partnerships in 2019 that are not assumed to repeat in 2020, and a level of net realized capital gains in 2019 not expected to recur in 2020. Management expects that the 2020 core earnings margin, which does not include the effect of net realized capital gains (losses) or integration costs associated with the acquired business, will be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5%, down from a 2019 core earnings margin of 8.9%, primarily due to the expectation of less favorable claim incidence and recoveries on long-term disability claims and lower expected investment income.
Net Income

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Net income increased in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a lower group disability loss ratio and a change from net realized capital losses in 2018 to net realized capital gains in 2019. Lower amortization of other intangibles, higher net investment income and lower integration costs were largely offset by higher insurance operating costs and other expenses.
Insurance operating costs and other expenses increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher commissions on our voluntary product offerings and investments in technology and claims operations, partially offset by achievements of expense synergies and lower state taxes and assessments.

Fully Insured Ongoing Premiums

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Fully insured ongoing premiums were relatively flat in 2019 compared to 2018 as a decrease in group life was offset by an increase in group disability and higher premiums from voluntary products.
Fully insured ongoing sales, excluding buyouts decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 with decreases in group disability and group life, partially offset by an increase in sales of voluntary products. Part of the decrease in fully insured ongoing sales was due to first year sales of the New York Paid Family Leave product in 2018.

['s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Interest expense decreased primarily due to the maturity of senior notes payable in January 2019 and the redemption of junior subordinated debentures in June 2018, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes in August 2019 in excess of the amount of proceeds used to redeem other outstanding senior notes. On June 15, 2018, The Hartford redeemed $500 aggregate principal amount of its 8.125% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2068. On January 15, 2019,

the Company repaid at maturity the $413 principal amount of its 6.0% senior notes. In third quarter 2019, after receiving net proceeds of $1.38 billion from the issuance of the 2.8% senior notes due August 19, 2029 and 3.6% senior notes due August 19, 2049, The Hartford repaid $265 of 5.75% senior notes due 2023 that had been assumed in the Navigators Group acquisition and $800 of 5.125% senior notes due 2022 of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $90. For additional information, see Note 13 - Debt of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company’s Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for risk oversight, as described more fully in our Proxy Statement, while management is tasked with the day-to-day management of the Company’s risks.
The Company manages and monitors risk through risk policies, controls and limits. At the senior management level, an Enterprise Risk and Capital Committee (“ERCC”) oversees the risk profile and risk management practices of the Company. As illustrated below, a number of functional committees sit underneath the ERCC, providing oversight of specific risk areas and recommending risk mitigation strategies to the ERCC.

In addition, certain insurance products offered by The Hartford provide coverage for losses incurred due to cyber events and the Company has assessed and modeled how those products would respond to different events in order to manage its aggregate exposure to losses incurred under the insurance policies we sell.  The Company models numerous deterministic scenarios including losses caused by malware, data breach, distributed denial of service attacks, intrusions of cloud environments and attacks of power grids.
Among specific risk tolerances set by the Company, risk limits are set for natural catastrophes, terrorism risk and pandemic risk.

Hartford Funds assets under management
Hartford Funds earnings are significantly influenced by the U.S. and other equity markets. If equity markets were to hypothetically decline 20% and remain depressed for one year, the estimated before tax impact on reported earnings for that one year period is $(50) as of December 31, 2019. The selection of the 20% shock to the S&P 500 was made only as an illustration to the potential hypothetical impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events. Actual results could differ materially due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the analysis.

actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin can be materially negatively affected, sometimes at a greater than linear rate. At times the impact of changes in certain market factors or a combination of multiple factors on RBC ratios can be counterintuitive. Factors include:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 in statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Decreases in the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, may reduce statutory surplus and RBC ratios.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Non-market factors can also impact the amount and volatility of either our actual or potential obligation, as well as the related statutory surplus and capital margin.

Most of these factors are outside rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings.

The following table presents the Company’s fixed maturities, AFS, by credit quality. The credit ratings referenced throughout this section are based on availability and are generally the midpoint of the available ratings among Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.

credit spreads. Fixed Maturities, FVO, are not included in the preceding table. For further discussion on FVO securities, see Note 5 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Available-for-sale Securities — Unrealized Loss Aging
The total gross unrealized losses were $55 as of December 31, 2019, and have decreased $599 from December 31, 2018, primarily due to lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. As of December 31, 2019, $50 of the gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed less than 20% of cost or amortized cost. The remaining $5 of gross unrealized losses were associated with securities depressed greater than 20%. The securities depressed more than 20% are primarily related to commercial real estate securities that were purchased at tighter credit spreads.
As part of the Company’s ongoing security monitoring process, the Company has reviewed its AFS securities in an unrealized loss

position and concluded that these securities are temporarily depressed and are expected to recover in value as the securities approach maturity or as market spreads tighten. For these securities in an unrealized loss position where a credit impairment has not been recorded, the Company’s best estimate of expected future cash flows are sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of the security. Furthermore, the Company neither has an intention to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell these securities. For further information regarding the Company’s impairment analysis, see Other-Than-Temporary Impairments in the Investment Portfolio Risks and Risk Management section of this MD&A.

This could change as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated.

Insurance Operations
While subject to variability period to period, underwriting and investment cash flows continue to be within historical norms and, therefore, the Company’s insurance operations’ current liquidity position is considered to be sufficient to meet anticipated demands over the next twelve months. For a discussion and tabular presentation of the Company’s current contractual obligations by period, refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations within the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of the MD&A.
The principal sources of operating funds are premiums, fees earned from assets under management and investment income, while investing cash flows primarily originate from maturities and sales of invested assets. The primary uses of funds are to pay claims, claim adjustment expenses, commissions and other underwriting and insurance operating costs, to pay taxes, to purchase new investments and to make dividend payments to the HFSG Holding Company.
The Company’s insurance operations consist of property and casualty insurance products (collectively referred to as “Property & Casualty Operations”) and Group Benefits.

 these estimates due to, among other things, changes in claim reporting and payment patterns and large unanticipated settlements.

[1] Cash activities in 2018 and 2017 include cash flows from Discontinued Operations; see Note 21 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on cash flows from Discontinued Operations.

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018
Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2019 as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to an increase in premiums received in excess of losses and expenses paid, including the effect of the Navigators Group acquisition, and an AMT refund of $421, partially offset by the fact that the 2018 period included operating cash flows of the life and annuity business sold in 2018.
Net cash used for investing activities increased primarily due to a change from net proceeds to net payments for fixed maturities in the 2019 period, as well as cash paid for the acquisition of Navigators Group of $1.9 billion (net of cash acquired), partially offset by net proceeds from short term investments, equity securities at fair value and derivatives in 2019 as opposed to net payments in the 2018 period. Further contributing to the increase in net cash used from investing activities were proceeds in 2018 from the sale of the life and annuity business.
Net cash used for financing activities decreased from the 2018 period primarily due to a decrease in cash used for net securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and an increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, partially offset by an increase in repayments of debt in 2019, an increase in treasury stock acquired in 2019, and a decrease in net payments for deposits, transfers and withdrawals for investments and universal life products due to the sale of the life and annuity business in 2018.
Operating cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. is a holding company for insurance and financial services subsidiaries that provide property and casualty insurance, group life and disability products and mutual funds and exchange-traded products to individual and business customers (collectively, “The Hartford”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”).

['s updated guidance for hedge accounting through a cumulative effect adjustment of less than $1 to reclassify cumulative ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges from retained earnings to AOCI. The updates allow hedge accounting for new types of interest rate hedges of financial instruments and simplify documentation requirements to qualify for hedge accounting. In addition, any gain or loss from hedge ineffectiveness is reported in the same income statement line with the effective hedge results and the hedged transaction. For cash flow hedges, the ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings only when the hedged transaction affects earnings; otherwise, the ineffectiveness gains or losses remain in AOCI. Under previous accounting, total hedge ineffectiveness was reported separately in realized capital gains and losses apart from the hedged transaction. The adoption did not affect the Company’s financial position or cash flows or have a material effect on net income.
Leases
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB’s updated lease guidance. Under the updated guidance, lessees with operating leases are required to recognize a liability for the present value of future minimum lease payments with a corresponding asset for the right of use of the property. Prior to the new guidance, future minimum lease payments on operating leases were commitments that were not recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet. Leases are classified as financing or operating leases. Where the lease is economically similar to a purchase because The Hartford obtains control of the underlying asset, the lease is classified as a financing lease and the Company recognizes amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense on the liability. Where the lease provides The Hartford with only the right to control the use of the underlying asset over the lease term and the lease term is greater than one year, the lease is an operating lease and the lease cost is recognized as rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Leases with a term of one year or less are also expensed over the lease term but not recognized on the balance sheet. On adoption, The Hartford recorded a lease payment obligation of $160 for outstanding leases and a right of use asset of $150, which is net of $10 in lease incentives received, with no change to comparative periods. As permitted by the new guidance, as of the implementation date, the Company did not reassess whether expired or existing contracts are leases or contain leases, did not change the classification of expired or existing operating leases, and did not reassess initial direct costs for existing leases to determine if deferred costs should be written-off or recorded on adoption. The adoption did not impact net income or cash flows.
Future Adoption of New Accounting Standards
Goodwill
The FASB issued updated guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The updated guidance requires recognition and measurement of goodwill impairment based on the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit compared to its estimated fair value, with the amount of the impairment not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Under existing guidance, if the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company allocates the fair value of the

reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value. An impairment loss is then recognized for the excess, if any, of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill compared to the implied goodwill value. The Company will adopt the updated guidance January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis as required. The Company would not have recognized a goodwill impairment loss for the years presented had the updated guidance been in effect. Since the estimated fair value of the reporting unit will no longer be allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value, under the updated guidance changes in market-based factors are more likely to result in a goodwill impairment, whether a reporting unit']:

['s U.S. group life and disability business through a reinsurance transaction for total consideration of $1.452 billion, comprised of cash of $1.450 billion and share-based awards of $2, and recorded provisional estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition enables the Company to increase its market share in the group life and disability industry. In 2018, The Hartford and Aetna agreed on the final assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and The Hartford finalized its provisional estimates with a final cash settlement within the one year measurement period allowed under U.S. GAAP. As a result, in the third quarter of 2018, The Hartford recorded additional assets and liabilities at fair value of $80 and $80, respectively, with no change in goodwill. The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, the measurement period adjustments recorded, and the final purchase price allocation.

Intangible Assets Recorded in Connection with the Acquisition

Asset Amount Estimated Useful Life
Value of in-force contracts $ 23 1 year
Customer relationships 590 15 years
Marketing agreement with Aetna 16 15 years
Total $ 629

The value of in-force contracts represents the estimated profits relating to the unexpired contracts in force at the acquisition date through expiry of the contracts. The value of customer relationships was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from the renewals of in-force contracts acquired less costs to service the related policies. The value of the marketing agreement with Aetna was estimated using net cash flows expected to come from incremental new business written during the three years duration of the agreement, less costs to service the related contracts. The value for each of the identifiable intangible assets was estimated using a discounted cash flow method. Significant inputs to the valuation models include estimates of expected premiums, persistency rates, investment returns, claim costs, expenses and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital.

Property and equipment represents an internally developed integrated absence management software acquired that was valued based on estimated replacement cost. The software is amortized over 5 years on a straight-line basis.
Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses acquired were recorded at estimated fair value equal to the present value of expected future unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments discounted using the net investment yield estimated as of the acquisition date plus a risk margin. The fair value adjustment for the risk margin is amortized over 12 years based on the payout pattern of losses and loss expenses as estimated as of the acquisition date.

Basic earnings per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share includes the dilutive effect of assumed exercise or issuance of warrants and stock-based awards under compensation plans.
In periods where a loss from continuing operations available to common stockholders or net loss available to common stockholders is recognized, inclusion of incremental dilutive shares would be antidilutive. Due to the antidilutive to common stockholders in such periods. As a result, for the year

ended December 31, 2017, the Company was required to use basic weighted average common shares outstanding in the diluted calculations, since the inclusion of 4.3 million shares for stock compensation plans and 2.5 million shares for warrants would have been antidilutive to the calculations.
Under the treasury stock method, for warrants and stock-based awards, shares are assumed to be issued and then reduced for the number of shares repurchaseable with theoretical proceeds at the average market price for the period. Contingently issuable shares are included for the number of shares issuable assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period, if dilutive.

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company carries certain financial assets and liabilities at estimated fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants. Our fair value framework includes a

hierarchy that as follows:

F-24

Table of Contents
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1 Fair values based primarily on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets, or liabilities, in active markets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2 Fair values primarily based on observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, or based on prices for similar assets and liabilities.

 judgment and represents the

Company’s best estimate of an amount that could be realized in a market exchange for the asset or liability. Also included are securities that are traded within illiquid markets and/or priced by independent brokers.
The Company will classify the financial asset or liability by level based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. Level 3.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS Allegorithmic On January 23, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Allegorithmic, a privately held 3D editing and authoring software company for gaming and entertainment, and integrated it into our Digital Media reportable segment. Prior to the acquisition, we held an equity interest that was accounted for as an equity-method investment. We acquired the remaining equity interest for approximately $106.2 million in cash consideration. The total purchase price, inclusive of the acquisition-date fair-value of our pre-existing equity interest, was approximately $161.1 million. In conjunction with the Allegorithmic acquisition, we separately recognized an investment gain of approximately $42.0 million, which represents the difference between the $54.8 million acquisition-date fair value of our pre-existing equity interest and our previous carrying amount. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Allegorithmic's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess purchase price over the value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Of the total purchase price, $125.9 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $44.8 million to identifiable intangible assets and the remainder to net liabilities assumed. Pro forma financial information has not been presented for the Allegorithmic acquisition as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material. Marketo On October 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Marketo, a privately held marketing cloud platform company, for approximately $4.73 billion of cash consideration. Adding Marketo's engagement platform to Adobe Experience Cloud furthers our long-term plan for strategic growth in the Digital Experience segment and enables us to offer a comprehensive set of solutions to enable customers across industries...

Valuation Techniques
The Company generally determines fair values using valuation techniques that use prices, rates, and other relevant information evident from market transactions involving identical or similar

instruments. Valuation techniques also include, where appropriate, estimates of future cash flows that are converted into a single discounted amount using current market expectations. The Company uses a "]:

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange.

 specific to the security types, or they may use recent transactions of similar securities. Due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices, valuations that are based on independent broker quotes are classified as Level 3.

The fair value of derivative instruments is determined primarily using a discounted cash flow model or option model technique and incorporates counterparty credit risk. In some cases, quoted market prices for exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives

may be used and in other cases independent broker quotes may be used. The pricing valuation models primarily levels, and reflect the Company’s view of what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments.
Valuation Controls
The process for determining the fair value of investments is monitored by the Valuation Committee, which is a cross-functional group of senior management within the Company. The purpose of the Valuation Committee is to provide oversight of the pricing policy, procedures changes to published bond prices of a corporate bond index, and daily OTC derivative market valuations to counterparty valuations. The Company has a dedicated pricing unit that works with trading and investment professionals to challenge the price received by a third party pricing source if the Company believes that the valuation received does not accurately reflect the fair value. New valuation models and changes to current models require approval by the Valuation Committee. In addition, the Company’s enterprise-wide Operational Risk Management function provides an independent review of the suitability and reliability of model inputs, as well as an analysis of significant changes to current models.
Valuation Inputs
Quoted prices for identical assets in active markets are considered Level 1 and consist of on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, money market funds, exchange-traded equity securities, open-ended mutual funds, certain short-term investments, and exchange traded futures and option contracts.

['s derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements as outlined in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Typically, these hedging instruments include interest rate swaps and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency swaps where the terms or expected cash flows of the hedged item closely match the terms of the swap. The interest rate swaps are typically used to manage interest rate duration of certain fixed maturity securities or debt instruments issued. The hedge strategies by hedge accounting designation include:
Cash Flow Hedges
Interest rate swaps are predominantly used to manage portfolio duration and better match cash receipts from assets with cash disbursements required to fund liabilities. These derivatives primarily convert interest receipts on floating-rate fixed maturity securities to fixed rates. The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps to convert the variable interest payments on 3 month LIBOR + 2.125% junior subordinated debt to fixed interest payments. For further information, see the Junior Subordinated Debentures section within Note 13 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign currency swaps are used to convert foreign currency-denominated cash flows related to certain investment receipts to U.S. dollars in order to reduce cash flow fluctuations due to changes in currency rates.
The Company also previously entered into forward starting swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure related to the future purchase of fixed-rate securities, primarily to hedge interest rate risk inherent in the assumptions used to price certain group benefits liabilities.
Non-qualifying Strategies
Derivative relationships that do not qualify for hedge accounting (“non-qualifying strategies”) primarily include hedging and replication strategies that utilize credit default swaps. In addition, hedges of interest rate, foreign currency and equity risk of certain fixed maturities and equities do not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying strategies include:

Credit Contracts
Credit default swaps are used to purchase credit protection on an individual entity or referenced index to economically hedge against default risk and credit-related changes in the value of fixed maturity securities. Credit default swaps are also used to assume credit risk related to an individual entity or referenced index as a part of replication transactions. These contracts require the Company to pay or receive a periodic fee in exchange for compensation from the counterparty should the referenced security issuers experience a credit event, as defined in the contract. In addition, the Company enters into credit default swaps to terminate existing credit default swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward.
Interest Rate Swaps, Swaptions and Futures
The Company uses interest rate swaps, swaptions and futures to manage interest rate duration between assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate swaps to terminate existing swaps, thereby offsetting the changes in value of the original swap going forward. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the notional amount of interest rate swaps in offsetting relationships was $7.6 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.
Foreign Currency Swaps and Forwards
The Company enters into foreign currency swaps to convert the foreign currency exposures of certain foreign currency-denominated fixed maturity investments to U.S. dollars. The Company may at times enter into foreign currency forwards to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash and, previously, equity securities. The Company previously entered into foreign currency forwards to hedge currency impacts on changes in equity of the U.K. property and casualty run-off subsidiaries that were sold in May 2017. For further information on the disposition, see Note 21 - Business Dispositions and Discontinued Operations of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Equity Index Options
The Company enters into equity index options to hedge the impact of a decline in the equity markets on the investment portfolio. The Company also enters into covered call options on equity securities to generate additional return.
Contingent Capital Facility Put Option
The Company previously entered into a put option agreement that provided the Company the right to require a third-party trust to purchase, at any time, The Hartford’s junior subordinated notes in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $500. On February 8, 2017, The Hartford exercised the put option resulting in the issuance of $500 in junior subordinated notes with proceeds received on February 15, 2017. Under the put option agreement, The Hartford had been paying premiums on a periodic basis and had agreed to reimburse the trust for certain fees and ordinary expenses.

Derivative Balance Sheet Classification
For reporting purposes, the Company has elected to offset within assets or liabilities based upon the net of the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related cash collateral receivables and payables of OTC derivative instruments executed in a legal entity and with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, which provides the Company with the legal right of offset. The following fair value amounts do not include income

accruals or related cash collateral receivables and payables, which are netted with derivative fair value amounts to determine balance sheet presentation. The Company’s derivative instruments are held for risk management purposes, unless otherwise noted in the following table. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and is presented in the table to quantify the volume of the Company’s derivative activity. Notional amounts are not necessarily reflective of credit risk.

The Company continues to monitor and assess the potential impacts of the discontinuation of LIBOR on its outstanding junior subordinated debentures.

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).

respectively, based on actual or estimated performance factors. The Company did not make cash payments in settlement of stock compensation during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
Subsidiary Stock Plan
In 2013 the Company established a subsidiary stock-based compensation plan similar to The Hartford Incentive Stock Plan except that it awards non-public subsidiary stock as compensation. The Company recognized stock-based compensation plan expense of $11, $9 and $9 in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for the subsidiary stock plan. Upon employee vesting of subsidiary stock, the Company recognizes a noncontrolling equity interest. Employees are restricted from selling vested subsidiary stock to anyone other than the Company and the Company has discretion on the amount of stock to repurchase. Therefore, the subsidiary stock is classified as equity because it is not mandatorily redeemable. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased $8 in subsidiary stock.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company sponsors The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under this plan, eligible employees of The Hartford purchase common stock of the Company at a discount rate of 5% of the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period. Accordingly, the plan is a non-compensatory plan. Employees purchase a variable number of shares of stock through payroll deductions elected as of the beginning of the offering period. The Company may sell up to 15,400,000 shares of stock to eligible employees under the ESPP. As of December 31, 2019, there were 4,084,500 shares available for future issuance. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 213,472 shares, 219,661 shares, and 204,533 shares were sold, respectively. The weighted average per share fair value of the discount under the ESPP was $2.82, $2.56 and $2.63 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value is estimated based on the 5% discount off the market price per share on the last trading day of the offering period.

The right-of-use asset as of December 31, 2019 was $191 and is included in property and equipment, net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Sale of life and annuity business
On May 31, 2018, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Hartford Holdings, Inc, completed the sale of its life and annuity business to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial

Group, Pine Brook and J. Safra Group. Under the terms of the sale agreement signed December 3, 2017, the investor group formed a limited partnership, Hopmeadow Holdings LP, that acquired HLI, and its life and annuity operating subsidiaries, for cash of approximately $1.4 billion after a pre-closing dividend to The Hartford of $300. The Hartford received a 9.7% ownership interest in the limited partnership, valued at a cost of $164 as of the sale date. In addition, as part of the terms of the sale agreement, The Hartford reduced its long-term debt by $142 because the debt, which was issued by HLI, was included as part of the sale. Including cash proceeds and the retained equity interest and net of transaction costs, net proceeds for the sale were approximately $1.5 billion. The life and annuity operations met the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations and are reported in the Corporate category through the date of sale.
The Company recognized a loss on sale within discontinued operations of approximately $3.3 billion in 2017 and a reduction in loss on sale of $202 in 2018. The reduction in loss on sale in 2018 primarily resulted from the reclassification to retained earnings of $193 of tax effects stranded in AOCI due to the accounting for Tax Reform and a $141 increase in estimated retained tax benefits, primarily net operating loss carryovers, partially offset by $104 of operating income from discontinued operations during the period up until the closing date and a reclassification of $10 of net unrealized capital gains from AOCI to retained earnings. See Note 1 - Adoption of New Accounting Standards within Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, for additional information about the reclassifications from AOCI to retained earnings. The estimated amount of retained net operating loss carryovers depends on the estimated tax basis of the business sold which increased subsequent to the date the Company entered into the sale agreement. At closing, stockholders’ equity was further reduced for the amount of AOCI of the life and annuity business, which was approximately $758, largely consisting of net unrealized gains on investments, net of shadow DAC. The AOCI balance was $1 billion as of December 31, 2017.
Cash inflows and outflows from and to the life and annuity business after closing were immaterial to the overall inflows and

outflows of the Company. Additionally, the revenues and expenses presented in continuing operations related to pre-disposal operations were immaterial.
The Company will continue to manage invested assets of the life and annuity business sold in May 2018 for an initial term of five years and provide transition services for up to 24 months.
The Hartford reported its 9.7% ownership interest in Hopmeadow Holdings LP, which is accounted for under the equity method, in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Hartford recognizes its share of income in other revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations on a three month delay, when financial information from the investee becomes available. The Company recognized $66, before tax, of income in 2019. Cash inflows for dividends received from Hopmeadow Holdings LP were $67 in 2019. Other cash inflows and outflows from and to the life and annuity business after closing were immaterial to the overall inflows and outflows of the Company.

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, and certain existing assets and liabilities. We do not use any of our derivative instruments for trading purposes. We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Collateral posted is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and collateral received is included in accrued expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash Flow Hedges In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. As of November 29, 2019, total notional amounts of outstanding cash flow hedges were $1.20 billion, hedging exposures denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our ant...

Credit Risk of Derivatives
The Company uses various derivative counterparties in executing its derivative transactions. The use of counterparties creates credit risk that the counterparty may not perform in accordance with the terms of the derivative transaction.
Downgrades to the credit ratings of the Company’s insurance operating companies may have adverse implications for its use of derivatives. In some cases, downgrades may give derivative

counterparties for OTC derivatives and clearing clearing brokers becoming unwilling to engage in or clear additional derivatives or may require additional collateralization before entering into any new trades.
Managing the Credit Risk of Counterparties to Derivative Instruments
The Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. The Company monitors counterparty exposure on a monthly basis reviewed by senior management.
The Company minimizes the credit risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties primarily rated A or better. The Company also generally requires that OTC derivative contracts be governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("]:

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).

[") Master Agreement, which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset. The Company enters into credit support annexes in conjunction with the ISDA agreements, which require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds.
The Company also has derivative counterparty exposure policies which limit the Company’s exposure to credit risk. Credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s net fair value, including income accruals, of all derivative positions transacted with a single counterparty for each separate legal entity. The notional amount of derivative contracts represents the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk.  The Company enters into collateral arrangements in connection with its derivatives positions and collateral is pledged to or held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the exposure is greater than zero, subject to minimum transfer thresholds or negotiated thresholds. In accordance with industry standards and the contractual requirements, collateral is typically settled on the same business day. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred no losses on derivative instruments due to counterparty default. For further discussion, see the Derivative Commitments section of Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Credit Derivatives
The Company may also use credit default swaps to manage credit exposure or to assume credit risk to enhance yield.
Credit Risk Reduced Through Credit Derivatives
The Company uses credit derivatives to purchase credit protection with respect to a single entity or referenced index. The Company purchases credit protection through credit default swaps to economically hedge and manage credit risk of certain fixed maturity investments across multiple sectors of the investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that purchase credit

protection was $124 and $6, respectively, while the fair value was $(3) and $0, respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.
Credit Risk Assumed Through Credit Derivatives
The Company also enters into credit default swaps that assume credit risk as part of replication transactions. Replication transactions are used as an economical means to synthetically replicate the characteristics and performance of assets that are permissible investments under the Company’s investment policies. These swaps reference investment grade single corporate issuers and indexes. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the notional amount related to credit derivatives that assume credit risk was $500 and $1.1 billion, respectively, while the fair value was $13 and $3, respectively. These amounts do not include positions that are in offsetting relationships.

European Exposure
While the European economy is showing signs of stabilization, structural challenges including elevated sovereign debt levels and demographic headwinds are expected to suppress economic

growth in the region. Political risk will likely remain elevated in Europe during 2020 due to uncertainty surrounding Brexit, increasing pressure on centrist governments in France and Germany and ongoing concern over Italian fiscal policy.  The Company manages the credit risk associated with its European securities within the investment portfolio on an on-going basis using several processes which are supported by macroeconomic analysis and issuer credit analysis.

Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits
While the Company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, minimum contributions are mandated in certain circumstances pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (MAP-21) and Internal Revenue Code regulations. The Company made contributions to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately $70, $101 and $280 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No contributions were made to the other postretirement plans in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The Company’s 2019, 2018 and 2017 required minimum funding contributions were immaterial. The Company does not have a 2020 required minimum funding contribution for the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and the funding requirements for all pension plans are expected to be immaterial. The Company has not determined whether, and to what extent, contributions may be made to the U. S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2020. The Company will monitor the funded status of the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan during 2020 to make this determination.
Beginning in 2017, the Company began to use a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and non-qualified pension plans and the postretirement benefit plan. The full yield curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that are used in its determination of the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. The change was made to provide a better estimate of the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost by better aligning projected benefit cash flows with corresponding spot rates on the yield curve rather than using a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve as had been done historically.
The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, and accordingly, recognized the effect prospectively beginning in 2017. For further discussion on full yield curve approach, see Part 2, Item 7, MD&A - Pension Plans and Other Postretirement in The Hartford’s 2018 Form 10-K Annual Report.
On June 30, 2017, the Company purchased a group annuity contract to transfer approximately $1.6 billion of the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligations related to certain U.S. retirees, terminated vested participants, and beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, in the second quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a pre-tax settlement charge of $750 ($488 net of tax) and a reduction to stockholders']:

As of December 31, 2019, uncollateralized letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of $165 and £60 million were outstanding under the Club Facility and £18 million was outstanding under the Bilateral Facility. As of December 31, 2019, the Bilateral Facility has unused capacity of $1 for issuance of additional letters of credit. Among other covenants, the Club Facility and Bilateral Facility contain financial covenants regarding tangible net worth and FAL. As of December 31, 2019, Navigators Group was in compliance with all financial covenants. In November of 2019, the Company issued £11 million of letters of credit under the Bilateral Facility.

Derivative Commitments
Certain of the Company’s derivative agreements contain provisions that are tied to the financial strength ratings, as set by nationally recognized statistical agencies, of the individual legal entity that entered into the derivative agreement. If the legal entity’s financial strength were to fall below certain ratings, the counterparties to the derivative agreements could demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization and in certain instances enable the counterparties to terminate the agreements and demand immediate settlement of all outstanding derivative positions traded under each impacted bilateral agreement. The settlement amount is determined by netting the derivative positions transacted under each agreement. If the termination rights were to be exercised by the counterparties, it could impact the legal entity’s ability to conduct hedging activities by increasing the associated costs and decreasing the willingness of counterparties to transact with the legal entity. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position as of December 31, 2019 was $81. For this $81, the legal entities have posted collateral of $77, in the normal course of business. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2019, a downgrade of one level below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would not require additional assets to be posted as collateral. Based on derivative market values as of December 31, 2019, a downgrade of two levels below the current financial strength ratings by either Moody’s or S&P would require an additional $5 of assets to be posted as collateral. These collateral amounts could change as derivative market values change, as a result of changes in our hedging activities or to the extent changes in contractual terms are negotiated. The nature of the additional collateral that we would post, if required,

[") as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting of Navigators Group, which was acquired on May 23, 2019, and whose financial statements constitute 10% of total assets and 5% of total net revenues of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at the acquired business.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 2. REVENUE Segment Information We report segment information based on the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. Our Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments.

Interest rate and credit default value.

The Company clears certain interest rate swap and credit default swap derivative transactions through central clearing houses. OTC-cleared derivatives require initial collateral at the inception of the trade in the form of cash or highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasuries and government agency investments. Central clearing houses also require additional cash as variation margin based income.
Forward contracts are customized commitments that specify a rate of interest or currency exchange rate to be paid or received on an obligation beginning on a future start date and are typically settled in cash.
Financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments, at a future date, for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through are settled daily in cash.
Option contracts grant the purchaser, for a premium payment, the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price, within a specified period or on a stated date. Option contracts are typically settled in cash.
Foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies, agreeing to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed upon exchange rate. There may also be a periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts.

Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Derivative instruments are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are reported in Other Investments and Other Liabilities. For balance sheet presentation purposes, the Company has elected to offset the fair value amounts, income accruals, and related legal right of offset.
On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value” hedge), (2) a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction or of amounts to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (3) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign

operation (“net investment” hedge) or (4) held for other investment and/or risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing asset or liability related risks and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company currently does not designate any derivatives as fair value or net investment hedges.
Cash Flow Hedges - Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, including foreign-currency cash flow hedges, are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into earnings when the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains and losses on derivative contracts that are reclassified from AOCI are recorded in the line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations in which the cash flows of the hedged item are recorded. Cash flows from cash flow hedges are presented in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Other Investment and/or Risk Management Activities - The Company’s other investment and/or risk management activities coupon settlements, of derivative instruments held for other investment and/or risk management purposes are reported in current period earnings as net realized capital gains and losses.
Hedge Documentation and Effectiveness Testing
To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, a derivative must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item. At hedge inception, the Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction. transactions and defining the effectiveness testing methods to be used. The Company also formally assesses both at the hedge’s inception and ongoing on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that or cash flows associated with the hedge relationship. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item.
Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting
The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that the qualifying criteria are no longer met; (2) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument; or (3) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the derivative continues to be carried at fair value on the

balance sheet with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is no with the hedged item.
When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the Company becomes aware that it is not probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings.
In other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are reclassified into earnings when earnings are impacted by the hedged item.
Embedded Derivatives
The Company purchases investments that contain embedded derivative instruments. When it is determined that (1) the embedded derivative possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the realized capital gains and losses.
Credit Risk of Derivative Instruments
Credit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to uncertainty of an obligor’s or counterparty’s ability or willingness and Derivatives Association agreements which are structured by legal entity and by counterparty, and permit right of offset. Some agreements require daily collateral settlement based upon agreed upon thresholds. For purposes of daily derivative collateral maintenance, credit exposures are generally quantified based on the prior business day’s market value and collateral is pledged to and held by, source. In addition, the Company monitors counterparty credit exposure on a monthly basis to ensure compliance with Company policies and statutory limitations.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost to acquire a business over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event for a potential impairment has occurred. The goodwill impairment test follows a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of a reporting unit measurement will be based on the first step only and, as such, goodwill will be impaired up to the

Intangible assets are assessed for impairment generally when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangibles. Finite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount is not recoverable from undiscounted cash flows. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired if the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Impaired intangible assets are written down to fair value.

Pension Plan Assets
Investment Strategy and Target Allocation
The overall investment strategy of the Pension Plan is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. With respect to asset management, the oversight responsibility of the Pension Plan rests with The Hartford’s Pension Fund Trust and Investment Committee composed of individuals whose responsibilities include establishing overall objectives and the setting of investment policy; selecting appropriate investment options and ranges; reviewing the asset allocation mix and asset allocation targets on a regular basis; and monitoring performance to determine whether or not the rate of return objectives are being met and that policy and guidelines are being followed. The Company believes that the asset allocation decision will be the single most important factor determining the long-term performance of the Pension Plan.

Target Asset Allocation

----------------------- ------------- -------------------------- ------- ------- -- - -- -

 Pension Plans Other Postretirement Plans
 Minimum Maximum Minimum Maximum
Equity securities 5 % 35 % 15 % 45 %
Fixed income securities 50 % 70 % 55 % 85 %
Alternative assets — % 45 % — % — %

Divergent market performance among different asset classes may, from time to time, cause the asset allocation to deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis. If it is determined that an asset allocation mix rebalancing is required, future portfolio additions and withdrawals will be used, as necessary, to bring the allocation within tactical ranges.
The Pension Plan invests in commingled funds and partnerships managed by unaffiliated managers to gain exposure to emerging

Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed "on a constant currency basis," is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange.
